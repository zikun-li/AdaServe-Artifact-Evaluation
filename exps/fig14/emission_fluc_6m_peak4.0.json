The proposed algorithm is a reimplementation of deep deterministic policy gradient with a continuous action space, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to map frames of the game to the expected action. The experiments conducted with two variants of the Doom game showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline solution in terms of accuracy, demonstrating superior performance with deeper CNNs.\n\nThis research demonstrates the feasibility of deep reinforcement learning for game AI. With the help of deep learning techniques, our model is able to apprehend abstract concepts and perform complex navigational tasks, ensuring a high accuracy compared to the traditional approach. Exploring the performance of other deep reinforcement learning algorithms on the Doom games could further improve the overall accuracy.\n\nThe applications of the proposed approach can extend beyond game AI to robotic navigation and control tasks, image processing, and decision-making. By embracing more complex reinforcement learning techniques, such as imitation learning, hierarchical learning and meta-learning, the proposed method can be applied in various AI-driven tasks, including robotics and healthcare, combat and autonomous driving.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nFirst it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep Aidan Turner's rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit BBC Sunday night series Poldark. Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer,\u00a0@AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'",

In the end it was a different but familiar name who won the Grand National on Saturday. 25-1 outsider Many Clouds, who had shown little form going into the race, won by a length and a half, ridden by jockey Leighton Aspell. Aspell won last year's Grand National too, making him the first jockey since the 1950s to ride back-to-back winners on different horses. \"It feels wonderful, I asked big questions,\" Aspell said of Many Clouds, moments after his victory. \"Over the fences he was awesome. I was just hoping his batteries would last and they did,\" he added. No fairytale . Yet for much of the Grand National -- arguably the world's most famous and certainly the sport's most prestigious jump race -- it looked as if AP McCoy was about to write an ending befitting the career of a man who has dominated jump racing for two decades. His horse Shutthefrontdoor was in the leading group as it negotiated the likes for Becher's Brooke and The Chair, some of the toughest jumps in racing. Last week the 40-year-old Ulsterman, who has won an astonishing 4,356 races, announced he would retire if he won the Grand National for the second time in his career. Shutthefrontdoor was heavily backed by the betting public sensing a storybook conclusion to McCoy's career. UK and Irish betting firms even predicted they would lose as much as $73 million if McCoy won. He was well placed going into the final straight but just couldn't keep up after Many Clouds cut lose, and finished back in fifth. Third time winner . But for Trevor Hemmings, the owner of Many Clouds, it was his third victory in the Grand National. \"I always dreamed of winning my first National,\" a shocked Hemmings told Channel 4. \"Then along comes a second. That's special. And when a third comes along, it's such a wonderful, wonderful feeling.\" Hemming went on to praise Aspell's performance. \"This morning talking we talked about the achievers,\" said Hemmings. \"They are quiet, confident and experienced. He has all of them.\" McCoy's fifth placed finish means he will race again at least once more, in two weeks time at Sandown.",

Jones-Bishop, snapped up from Leeds Rhinos in the close-season, extended his lead as Salford's leading scorer with his seventh of the campaign. The Red Devils were hanging onto a 12-8 interval lead when Jones-Bishop struck on the hour to help his club leapfrog the Warriors into third place in the table. Both sides ended the match with 12 men as tempers flared during the Super League match . But Salford forward Weller Hauraki, already facing a ban after an incident at Huddersfield in Friday, and John Bateman were sent off two minutes from time for trading punches after the pair had already been sin binned following an earlier flare up. Salford's last win against Wigan was a 16-4 Challenge Cup fifth-round victory at the Willows in 2006. The long-awaited victory was particularly sweet for the the three former Wigan players in the Red Devils ranks - Scott Taylor, skipper Harrison Hansen and try scorer Michael Dobson. Dobson was outstanding and also helped set up two tries for full-back Niall Evalds. Salford brought in Evalds to replace full-back Kevin Locke who was concussed at Huddersfield. Wigan again left out Matty Bowen with Ryan Hampshire continuing at full-back and Lewis Tierney replacing Dom Manfredi on the wing. Conor Farrell, younger brother of second row Liam, also stepped into the squad with Joel Tomkins missing. Wigan Warriors' Michael McIlorum is tackled by Salford Red Devils's Liam Hood  and Weller Hauraki . Salford organised a reunion of their 1996 side, which famously ended Wigan's record-breaking Challenge Cup run, with the players and then coach Andy Gregory introduced to the fans before the kick-off. But the kick-off was delayed 15 minutes due to crowd congestion outside the AJ Bell Stadium. Wigan would have snatched an early lead had Tierney not slipped when Jones-Bishop spilled a George Williams kick. Salford's relief was short-lived when their defence failed to deal with another towering Matty Smith kick and Larne Patrick picked up the loose ball to stroll over for his first try for the club since his move from Huddersfield. Hampshire tagged on the conversion with the Red Devils forced to make an early substitution when Tommy Lee hobbled off after 11 minutes to be replaced by Liam Hood. A storming break by Josh Griffin put Wigan under pressure for the first time with Joe Burgess forced to make a try-saving tackle on Rangi Chase. But Salford suffered another injury blow midway through the first half when Cory Paterson was helped off with a knee problem. Wigan increased the lead to 8-0 with a Hampshire penalty after Weller Hauraki was caught offside from a Smith kick. The Red Devils hit back with Dobson and Chase combining for Evalds to dart over with Josh Griffin adding the conversion. Wigan lost Tony Clubb with a thigh injury before Salford took the lead for the first time with a sizzling try from Dobson against his old club. Josh Griffin broke clear from inside his own half for the supporting Dobson to notch his first try for the club with Griffin tagging on the goal to make it 12-8. The bumper crowd generated a tremendous atmosphere and the Red Devils fans were cheering again with a blistering burst from his own line by Evalds after gathering a Williams kick. Then Jones-Bishop grabbed a superb solo try on the hour to fire his side into an 18-8 lead. There appeared to be no danger to Wigan when Jones-Bishop took the ball 45 metres out. But he burst through two tackles and then rounded Hampshire in style to notch his seventh try of the season with Griffin converting. The hard-fought contest erupted 15 minutes from time with referee Richard Silverwood sin-binning Hauraki and Bateman after a melee. Hampshire put Wigan right back in the thrilling match with a fine try after 68 minutes and also added the goal to cut the gap to 18-14. Salford sealed the win when Dobson's perfect pass sent Evalds over for his second try four minutes from time with Griffin booting his fourth goal from four attempts. Another flare up two minutes from time saw Bateman and Hauraki red carded before Burgess went over 39 seconds from time.",

Jim Jepps used a blog called The Daily Maybe to defend 'rape fantasies', describe paedophiles as 'complex human beings' and question why teachers who have relationships with pupils are put on the sex offenders register. The couple met five years ago when Ms Bennett contacted him to correct something he had written about her, but now the Green party stresses they do not 'want to be associated' with his internet rants. Scroll down for video . Green party leader Natalie Bennett has distanced herself from the bizarre blog posts of her boyfriend Jim Jepps, insisting he is a 'private individual not involved in party politics' Ms Bennett's profile has soared in recent months, buoyed by rising poll ratings and Green party membership in England passing 60,000 for the first time. However, little is known about her private life, in contrast to the spouses of David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg who have been frequently seen on the campaign trail. Ms Bennett has been dating Mr Jepps for five years, after meeting online. He continued blogging on the Daily Maybe site until 2011. He quit the Socialist Workers Party in around 2003 and later joined the Greens. Bizarrely, he left the party in 2012, the year Ms Bennett replaced the more high-profile Caroline Lucas as Green leader. On his website, Mr Jepps appears to have deliberately courted controversy with a series of controversial blog posts, often related to sex, rape or paedophiles. In one post, seen by MailOnline, he joked that gay sex is not a sin 'unless you do it really well or claim it on expenses'. In 2007, he tackled a news story about demands for music books written by a paedophile to be withdrawn, because the recorder lessons were used to groom victims. Mr Jepps wrote: 'We can burn these books as a public statement against the author (who is in jail for his crimes) or try to understand that whatever monstrous acts individuals commit they are still complex human beings for all that. 'Good, evil, interesting and banal by turns - not devils who can taint everything they touch with evil.' He also dismissed a case in which a blogger was charged with obscenity for writing an article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud. 'Either I'm hopelessly jaded or getting depraved and corrupted is a lot duller than I remember\u2026 Personally I didn't find it that shocking.' Mr Jepps quit the Green party in 2012, the same year Ms Bennett became leader after replacing Caroline Lucas (left) According to the Sunday Mirror another posting included: 'New Poll: Sex with pupils - good idea/bad idea? Personally I'm ambivalent and would appreciate any guidance. 'It seems to me the sex offenders register is a sledgehammer to crack a nut sometimes. When you have a teacher who kissed a 17-year-old placed on the same register as Gary Glitter it does make you wonder how useful the list is, no matter how creepy that teacher might be.' Another post entitled 'Even monsters have feelings' is said to have covered the case of Austrian schoolgirl Natascha Kampusch, who was kidnapped aged 10 by Wolfgang P\u0159iklopil and held in a cellar for . Mr Jepps wrote: 'These are two people who had a long term and human relationship.' Ms Bennett and Mr Jepp reportedly share a flat she bought for \u00a3249,950 in 2007 in North London. Last night the Green Party distanced itself from Mr Jepp's remarks. A spokesman said: 'The Daily Maybe was a personal blog written by Mr Jepps until 2011. 'The party does not endorse the views expressed and would not want to be associated with them. Jim Jepps has not been a member of the party since 2012.' Ms Bennett said: 'Jim is a private individual not involved in party politics. I will not be commenting on words he's said or written.'",

The university said recent changes to the exams system made it more difficult to decide which students to admit. Pupils applying to Cambridge University may have to take an entrance test next year for the first time in almost 30 years . According to trade magazine Schools Week, documents presented to senior tutors say the university is \u2018being forced\u2019 into changing its system of using AS-levels to assess applicants. The paper says that GCSEs \u2018will not give us a reliable measure\u2019 due to their ongoing reform and that \u2018schools\u2019 predictions of grades will be next to useless\u2019. At present, the university uses unified mark scheme (UMS) scores calculated from students\u2019 performance in their AS-levels - which are known when they apply to university - to decide which applicants are invited to interview. But under coalition reforms planned to \u2018toughen up\u2019 the qualifications, AS exams will be optional for cohorts starting this September and scores will no longer contribute to the overall A-level. The Labour party has pledged to halt the changes and retain AS-levels. University departments have now been asked for their views on a \u2018main proposal\u2019 to reintroduce the tests from the 2016-17 admissions round. Under coalition reforms planned to \u2018toughen up\u2019 the qualifications, AS exams will be optional for cohorts starting this September . Mike Sewell, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said: \u2018In the light of the recent A-level reforms, the university is in the process of considering all options available so that we may continue meeting our goal of admitting the best and brightest students from all backgrounds.\u2019 Oxford University already uses subject-specific aptitude tests. Most of its admission tests are organised by the Admissions Testing Service. The disclosure has been met with concern by school leaders, who said institutions with fewer resources may not be able to properly equip pupils for the tests. Eddie Playfair, principal of Newham Sixth Form College, London, said: \u2018There\u2019s a danger students in smaller sixth forms don\u2019t have the same resources and might lose out.

The king is dead; long live the king. Long to reign over us. Or should that be rain over us? The heavy downpours that drenched Augusta on Tuesday would have been greeted by groans from soaked patrons and photographers hoping for snaps of glamourous WAGs. But Northern Ireland\u2019s world No 1 would be forgiven if he had grinned from ear to ear. That\u2019s because each of McIlroy\u2019s four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week. Wet conditions hand McIlroy a massive advantage: his huge hitting with sky-high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles. Shorter hitters or those with low ball flight, meanwhile, will have no roll on the wet fairways and will be hitting their approach shots from miles back. Rory McIlroy shields himself from the rain on Tuesday - but a wet course will play into his hands . Augusta National looks at its finest in the sun, but the world No 1 has won all of his four majors after rain . And that is no good at Augusta, where precise approaches are vital to the most strategically demanding greens in major championship golf. Last year\u2019s trio of Fred Couples (66-1 for 20th), Miguel Angel Jimenez (150-1 for 4th) and Bernhard Langer (400-1 for 8th) will be tough to match that this time round, but here goes\u2026 . Patrick Reed (40-1) \u2013 Brash, proud of it and born to show off on the biggest stage. Only his second Masters but played Augusta National many times as a college student. Tiger Woods (45-1) \u2013 OK, so no-one knows which Woods will turn up, but this could be one of the all-time cheeky punts. Practice form and rededication to the game are promising signs. Paul Casey (70-1) \u2013 Back to near his best after finally getting fully fit and committing to play full time in the US. Fifth-best on the PGA Tour in par-five scoring \u2013 crucial at Augusta. Since the work done to \u2018Tiger-proof\u2019 the course in the noughties, the home of the year\u2019s first major has become a bomber\u2019s course. Bubba Watson, with two wins in three years, Adam Scott and Angel Cabrera are all big-hitting recent champions, but examine the list of leaderboards in recent years and you\u2019ll find them dominated by players whose favourite club in the bag is driver. Mother Nature looks set to smile on McIlroy again this week with heavy rain forecast, particularly on Friday and Saturday. If that happens, the number of players who can win reduces dramatically. Three-time champion Phil Mickelson (28-1) and England\u2019s former US Open winner Justin Rose (45-1) are tempting at their prices, but neither have hit their top form this year, so would be backed based on gut feeling rather than cold hard facts. The likes of Jordan Spieth (10-1), Zach Johnson (100-1), Ian Poulter (80-1) and Jamie Donaldson (125-1) have the brains and skill sets to get the job done. Woods (45-1) must be included in that group too, despite having no form, providing the chipping yips do not strike again. But they will all have to be at the very top of their games for the entire week to compete with the boom-boom brigade. Bubba Watson's power has taken him to two Masters victories, but his last title defence ended badly . Tiger Woods has the skill set to succeed for a fourth time at Augusta, but he must answer big questions . McIlroy (6-1) heads that pack, closely followed by Watson (11-1). Australia\u2019s Jason Day (14-1) and Adam Scott (20-1), and Sweden\u2019s Henrik Stenson (22-1) are joined by American gunslingers Dustin Johnson (16-1) and Jimmy Walker (22-1) as the big hitters who have shown best form so far this year. The Masters, played on the modern-day Augusta, is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified: long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket. Brooks Koepka (5-1)\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s always tough to know how a player with no experience of Augusta will take to the place, but this monster-hitter looks to have the perfect game. The 24-year-old American globetrotter has won the Phoenix Open to the Turkish Airlines Open in the last six months. Scott, the 2011 champion, has made a late switch back to his long putter, which does not bode well. Stenson has been battling the flu, which either rules him out or makes him more dangerous, depending on whether you believe the old adage: \u2018beware the wounded golfer\u2019. But what makes Day, Johnson and Walker so appealing is that each has claimed at least one big win already this year on courses that favour big hitters. Day (Torrey Pines), Walker (Pebble Beach) and Johnson (Doral) have shown they possess the perfect mix of long driving, precise iron control and dead-eyed putting under the heat of competition. That is the perfect recipe for a Masters champion. Their only problem is that McIlroy has used it to taste success on four occasions in majors, and Watson two, while they are all still waiting to dine at the top table. Jason Day has a brilliant record at Augusta and the final step left for the Australian to take is victory . Dustin Johnson's colossal power means he has the weapon most needed to conquer Augusta . Jimmy Walker chips onto the second green during practice, and could be set for a big week . But the pressure is mounting on McIlroy as he bids for golfing immortality. Watson, meanwhile, could only finish 50th in defence of his title two years ago and could be rusty after a month off. And given he finished second on his Masters debut in 2011, third two years later and 10th 12 months ago despite battling a broken thumb, Sunday could be a perfect Day for Australia and the man who has long looked to be golf\u2019s next major champion. Course: Augusta National Golf Club, par 72, 7435 yards. Defending champion: Bubba Watson (11-1) Bookies\u2019 favourite: Rory McIlroy (6-1) Best Bets: . Jason Day (14-1) Dustin Johnson (16-1) Jimmy Walker (22-1)",

The clawed creature - which some say is a rare bear - can be seen aggressively biting through the cage with a visibly bleeding mouth before ripping the metal wire apart with its limbs.

The clip has sparked heated debates on Chinese social media site WeiBo, with some users claiming it depicts a 'water monster' from Chinese folklore. Other users alluded to the creature being impacted by pollution, with Shenzhen Reservoir being recently deluged with toxic sewerage that turned parts of the region blood red. Some claimed it was in fact a Malaysian Bear who was suffering from alopecia, a disease which causes baldness.

The video has been the subject of heated online debates over the species of the animal, with some users claiming it is a mythical 'water monster' and others that it's a diseased Malaysian Bear . A similar video surfaced in January of an ailing sun bear in Borneo island in Malaysia, which had been beaten by local plantation workers and driven into the bush. It was reported this month that the animal was discovered at another nearby plantation, where it is being nursed back to health. David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia the caged animal 'looks like a bear cub which is suffering from some medical condition which has caused it to loose all of its fur.' While he was unable to confirm if it was the same bear from the Borneo clip, he said he suspects it is and that the footage originates from Borneo not China. A heavily-polluted field in\u00a0Shenzhen Reservoir, where the mystery beats was apparently captured, has fuelled accusations the animal may have been contaminated .

It turns out, there are things that you can do to make you feel slightly happier everyday. The best part?\u00a0According to author of Happier People Healthier Planet, Dr Teresa Belton, they're all completely free. Dr Teresa Belton insists that there are many simple things - such as inviting a lonely person out to tea - that we can do on a daily basis to increase happiness, and they are all free . Researcher and education expert at the University of East Anglia, Dr Teresa Belton, believes that people living modestly tend to find more satisfaction in their lives. Simple activities such as inviting someone out for a cup of tea, singing in a community choir and practicing good posture can all improve general wellbeing. This is because they are all activities that generate a sense of belonging, and help the person adopt confident habits. Author Belton has insisted that practices as small as going on walks can be calming and restorative . The 62-year-old believes simple acts such as straightening posture (left) and joining a community choir (right) can increase happiness levels over time . Firstly the doctor emphasises that it is important to prioritise 'wellbeing' over happiness. Belton says: 'Wellbeing is a continuing state, while happiness can come and go. Wellbeing means that we both feel good and function well.' Her book, Happier People Healthier Planet, supports the belief that while many strive for material things that may generate temporary happiness, it is not sustainable way to be. Belton insists that it's actually non-material things that support our wellbeing, like good relationships and a sense of belonging. List five things for which you are grateful: Whether they are big or small things, Belton recommends doing this for ten weeks can have a big impact on wellbeing . Among her simply everyday tips to feeling happier right away - see below - she highlights seemingly trivial activities such as standing up straight and smiling, and even hanging washing up outdoors. The doctor and author also highlights that there are ways you can invest in happiness and wellbeing for the long run. Practices include regularly making lists of things for which you are grateful. In fact, studies have shown that doing this for a period of ten weeks can have a real lasting affect on wellbeing. Other practices include mindful meditation and taking up voluntary work. Declutter:  Give stuff away, donate possessions to charity or pass them on to someone who could use them. This can relieve stress and create a sense of lightness and unburdening. A less cluttered bedroom can also bring the added bonus of better sleep. Hang washing up outdoors:\u00a0Getting some fresh air and creating an orderly line of washing will give you a relaxing break and a reason to get outside in the garden. Invite a lonely person to tea: Or offer to help your neighbour with their garden, leaking pipe, shopping, etc. Feeling needed and having a sense of belonging to a community are important factors for a sense of wellbeing. Go for a walk: Time spent in green surroundings has shown time and time again to be calming and restorative. Even a green view is beneficial, so try and buy some indoor plants too: geraniums for a window sill, ivy for a dark corner, and herbs for the kitchen. Stand up straight, and smile:\u00a0The way we hold ourselves and our facial expression affects the way we feel. Adopt a confident posture and you will feel more confident; look calmly on the world and it will seem a friendlier place. Visit an empty beach or hilltop:\u00a0Being a tiny part of an immense landscape can reassuringly put worries into perspective. Get moving:\u00a0Physical activity gets us out of our heads and generates endorphins, the hormone which makes us feel good; dig the garden, cycle, walk, dance, make pastry, or even mow the lawn. Appreciate the little things:\u00a0From a spider spinning a web, to a bird singing: these are just a few of the endless everyday details which we often overlook or take for granted, yet which can delight us if we let them. List five things for which you are grateful:\u00a0Whether they are big or small. Research has shown that doing this every week for ten weeks can result in lasting increases in wellbeing, as it gets us into the habit of seeing our life through a positive lens. Join a community choir: Singing regularly with other people is rewarding not only because of the pleasure derived from the music itself, but also because it is sociable and it demands effort, commitment and attention. Take up regular voluntary work: Social connectedness, as well as freely giving your time, attention and energy, and making a positive difference  all contributes to our own satisfaction with life. Get stuck in:\u00a0Active engagement is a big aspect of personal wellbeing. If you really enjoy your chosen activity, you will lose yourself in it and experience a wonderful sense of 'flow'. Think about your place in the scheme of things: Having a sense of meaning or purpose in life, whether it is religious, political, social, artistic or any other framework, is known to be important for wellbeing.

Designers around the world are creating economy and premium economy seats that are comfier and provide more legroom, and some of them have radical changes from today\u2019s chairs. But passengers shouldn\u2019t expect any instant relief \u2013 these seats with reclining backrests, innovative armrests and ergonomic designs are still a few years off \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing they can do to stop a crying baby or noisy sleeper. Crawley-based\u00a0Acro Aircraft Seating recently unveiled the design for its new premium economy seat . Acro's 'Series 7' seat has\u00a0hand-stitched leather armrests, an aluminium chassis and composite materials . The seats were designed to eliminate the sources of discomfort and provide more space for the occupants . Passengers who are willing to pay a little extra for a seat in premium economy \u2013 which brings more legroom and some of the perks of business class \u2013 could one day sit in seats designed by Crawley-based Acro Aircraft Seating. Located next to Gatwick Airport, the firm is reshaping the future of the cabin that straddles business and economy with thinner and lighter seats that are designed with comfort and safety in mind. The \u2018Series 7\u2019 seats, unveiled at last week\u2019s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, . Managing director Chris Brady said the seats were designed to eliminate the sources of discomfort and provide more space for the occupants. He told MailOnline Travel: \u2018We believe that comfort is found in the spaces between seats. Chris Brady, Acro's managing director, said big seats that are 'lazily padded' take up legroom . Acro currently makes thousands of economy class seats for airlines such as KLM, Thomas Cook and Spirit . \u2018Padding is not a proxy for comfort, padding is a lazy way of delivering the right shape. What you really want to do is deliver a shape that is ergonomically proper \u2013 so the hips aren\u2019t shifted forward and the back is a little bit reclined.\u2019 He added: \u2018If you have a big, fat six-inch seat that is lazily padded you are taking five inches of legroom. In our case our seat is less than half an inch thick at its thickest.\u2019 Mr Brady said the seats \u2013 with an aluminium chassis, composite materials and hand-stitched leather armrests \u2013 must pass an onerous certification process, meaning they won\u2019t actually fly until 2017. The firm, which received a Queen\u2019s Award for Enterprise this week, currently makes thousands of economy class seats for airlines such as KLM, Thomas Cook and Spirit. Thompson Aero Seating has come up with a way to make the middle seat a less punishing experience . The 'Cozy Suite' has seats positioned at a slight diagonal angle, with dedicated sleeping positions . In Northern Ireland, Thompson Aero Seating has come up with a way to make the middle seat a less punishing experience. The firm\u2019s \u2018Cozy Suite\u2019 would see seats positioned at a slight diagonal angle to give the passenger in the middle a little more breathing room. Based south-west of Belfast, the company said the \u2018innovative and flexible solution\u2019 could be applied to economy and premium economy cabins. It said the unconventional design offers increased seat and shoulder width, individual armrests, a dedicated sleeping position, improved egress and easier access to the aisle. Hong Kong\u2019s Paperclip Design may have solved the elbow war problem with a dual-user armrest . The 'Meerkat Seat' concept has a number of features to improve comfort and store belongings . One of passengers\u2019 biggest gripes \u2013 especially for those stuck in the middle seat \u2013 is the battle for the armrest. But Hong Kong\u2019s Paperclip Design may have solved the elbow war problem with a unique \u2018double-decker\u2019 armrest on long-haul economy seats designed by James Lee. The armrest is shaped like a paperclip, allowing two passengers to use the armrest. Mr Lee\u2019s \u2018Meerkat Seat\u2019 concept is intended for long-haul flights in economy, with a number of features to help those who bring too many of their possessions on board. The backrest  allowing passengers to relax without crushing the knees of the person seated behind them . The reclining seats have enough space for belongings, plus a stand for tablets and a fixed cup holder . Passengers in the 'Meerkat Seat' have a footrest and a personal cabinet instead of a seat pocket . It features a reclining backrest for sleeping, a tray with a stand for tablet computers and a footrest under the chair in front. The backrest seats offer an alternative to the traditional recliner mode \u2013 allowing passengers to relax without crushing the knees of the person seated behind them. The lower portion of the backrest cushion detaches, pushing the traveller forward in a 'deep recline' position, allowing them to stretch their legs out in front. Mr Lee's design include a fixed cup holder \u2013 meaning the tray could be stowed \u2013 a personal cabinet instead of a seat pocket, a hook for headphones, a vanity mirror and a shared literary rack between every two seats.",

Rachel Chepulis, 26, was arrested with Wesley E. Brown III in North Bend, Oregon almost three weeks after she helped him break out of Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota. 35-year-old Brown, who is married with children, was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm - and is thought to have seduced single Chepulis while behind bars. Fugitive couple: Female prison guard Rachel Chepulis\u00a0and felon\u00a0Wesley E. Brown III have been captured in Oregon after she helped him escape from jail in North Dakota 19 days ago . His escape from Devils Lake on March 13., aided by Chepulis, is the second time he has broken out of a secure unit. In June 2013 he escaped from Heart of America Correctional Center, climbing over a fence at the prison's recreation area. On that occasion Brown was recaptured three hours later and transferred to Devils Lake prison, where he spent a considerable amount of time prior his second jail break in March. Dan Orr, chief deputy U.S. marshal for North Dakota, told the Daily News: 'It's clear in the time he was there they developed a relationship. That he was allowed to escape was assisted by the fact there were mistakes made by the jail. Caught: The pair managed to get 1,700 miles from the North Dakota jail before being captured in Oregon . 'He was classified at a lower level than he should have been considering he already escaped from another facility. And he had assistance from the female jailer. 'It was pretty clear the jail didn't realize what she had done. But once we began the investigation, we realized she had a direct involvement in the escape.' The Marshals Service relies on local jails to hold federal prisoners awaiting sentencing in North Dakota and during his time at Devils Lake, the convicted Brown must have befriended the single Chepulis, Mr Orr claimed. The fugitive couple was caught outside a Bi-Mart store in North Bend yesterday with the help of Oregon State Police, who tracked down Chepulis' 2015 Toyota Rav4 with North Dakota plates after a tip off from a nearby hotel. Chepulis, arrested as she returned to the vehicle, was found to have Brown's\u00a0initials\u00a0tattooed on her left ring finger. Married felon: Brown, who has a wife and childre, is thought to have befriended single Rachel Chepulis while locked up at\u00a0Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota, above . Brown is to face additional escape charges while Chepulis will be hit with instigating or assisting an escape, concealing a person from arrest and conspiracy to commit escape . Each charge carries a five-year prison sentence. The pair will be arraigned in Oregon, likely Thursday, and then held without bond as they face extradition to North Dakota. Mr Orr said he was unable to offer more details of the jail break or the couple's time on the run until the court affidavit is unsealed.",

Analysis revealed that the calcite on skull was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago, during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of Antarctica and Greenland. The team say samples of DNA have also been retrieved from the sample, and because of the age, represent the oldest such samples ever recovered from Neanderthal remains. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. If they manage to sequence the DNA, they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the Neanderthal. Separate research earlier this week found that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he has been dreaming of beating rivals City in Sunday's derby at Old Trafford but will have to do so without Robin van Persie. Van Persie said he was fit to feature in the game against City on Sunday after ankle trouble but Van Gaal has ruled him out. 'Most of the players are fit but being fit for me is different,' Van Gaal said. Robin van Persie will not return to the fray for Manchester United  against Manchester City on Sunday . Louis van Gaal explained at his press conference on Friday that Van Persie is not yet fit enough to play . United players train in the sunshine ahead of their game against local rivals City on Sunday . 'Robin is not fit enough to play.' With City rocking after defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday, Van Gaal and his players have an opportunity to finish as high as second or third  and avoid a Champions League qualifying fixture later in the summer. The United boss wants his side to move towards that target by taking all three points against City. Van Gaal said: ' I dream of it. Every player should dream of the victory. 'Of course I want to win because it's a big step up the table also. If we win then third place is available. Van Gaal watches on as he prepares his side for his first Manchester derby at Old Trafford . Manager Van Gaal (left) oversees the training while captain Wayne Rooney runs with the ball . Goalkeeper David de Gea (left), winger Angel di Maria (centre) and Radamel Falcao were in training action . Rooney leads the way in training as he runs through some cones in the sunshine on Friday in Manchester . (Left to right) Di Maria, Juan Mata, Falcao, Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera prepare to take on City . 'A few months ago, nobody would have thought about that, apart from me. 'If we win then the position in the table is good as we would then almost certainly be qualified for the top four. And if we are third it's better than the goal we set in pre-season.' Van Gaal acknowledged that City will provide a stern challenge to his team and played down the idea he will be motivated by revenge, after losing the away fixture earlier in the campaign. 'We have lost 1-0, that is my history, the last game,' Van Gaal said. 'I say always in such games, always, you have to control your aggression. 'We did not do that at that time. So I hope we have learned from that moment. I cannot say because we lost that game that we have to win this game. 'In my opinion, you can lose to Man City two times. That is possible.' The United boss also ruled out a potential return for Luke Shaw. Like Van Persie, Van Gaal does not yet consider him fit enough to feature. 'I don\u2019t think Shaw is fit enough to play,' Van Gaal said. 'But I cannot say they are not fit, but in my opinion they are not fit to play. That is a different question.' Luke Shaw is another player yet to be at the standard of match fitness required by Van Gaal . (Left to right) Rooney, Ashley Young, goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard and Michael Carrick have a  breather . Falcao (left) and Antonio Valencia (second right) look in high spirits as they prepare for the derby . Herrera will be hoping to continue the fine form that has seen him become one of United's key players recently . Van Gaal admitted he is looking forward to sampling the derby atmosphere at Old Trafford, as he takes on City with home advantage for the first time since arriving at the club. 'When I see the fans of Man Utd, they are supporting us in a marvellous way, I think,' Van Gaal said. 'After matches, I give our fans a big compliment, not because I have to, because then I wouldn\u2019t say it. I say it because I feel it.'",

Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, was once dubbed \u2018Jabba the Hutt\u2019 by bullies and became so depressed over his size that he refused to leave his house for a year. He was just 18 when he took an overdose of 30 pills, but survived, ironically, because he hadn\u2019t taken enough to defeat his massive frame. Scroll down for video . From bulk to hulk: Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, pictured before (left) and after (right) his staggering weight loss, was once dubbed \u2018Jabba the Hutt\u2019 by bullies . Following his suicide attempt in September 2011, something snapped in Nathan and he made the decision to stop wallowing in self-pity and turn his life around. Within two years, he had shrunk to 14 stone. During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds. Nathan ran the streets in the dead of night when no-one was around and turned off the lights so he could use a treadmill at his local gym unseen. After a year, Nathan started using weights to tone his slimmed-down figure, and was so successful he landed himself a job as a personal trainer. Nathan, now a trim 13 stone, said: 'I was always overweight as a kid and as I grew up the bullying contributed to that because I tended to comfort eat. 'Others would throw sweets at me when I was on the bus and call me \"fatty\", \"fat mess\" and \"Jabba the Hutt\". Transformation: Nathan's former 26-stone bulk (left) drove him to a suicide attempt when he was only 18, but he has since lost more than half his bodyweight and is now a ripped gym instructor (right) Following his suicide attempt, something snapped in Nathan, pictured before his weight loss, and he made the decision to stop wallowing in self-pity and turn his life around . During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds . 'It was at that period in high school where I started to become really self-conscious about my weight. 'I didn\u2019t leave the house for a year and the only time I would leave my room would be to go downstairs to get food.' Nathan added: 'My parents were really worried about me and tried to tell me to go and see somebody for help. 'After the failed suicide I realised that I needed to turn my life around and I started to diet. 'It was scary going outside and I was too afraid to leave the house because I thought people would be judging me. Before his lifestyle overhaul, Nathan was a sugar addict who gorged on bacon and egg butties, chocolate bars and greasy takeaways. He then went cold turkey and cut out junk food, chocolate, crisps and alcohol, and said he was left suffering from flu-like symptoms as a result. Nathan snacked on cashew nuts and went on a strict low-carb diet which helped him lose a stone a month for eight months. In progress: Nathan said, 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence, so for the first month it was purely diet' He added,\u00a0'When I did eventually start going to the gym, I used to run in a darkened room which was there for people with low self-esteem' 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence so for the first month it was purely diet. 'Then I would get up at three or four in the morning to go for a jog because I didn\u2019t want anybody to see me. 'When I did eventually start going to the gym, I used to run in a darkened room which was there for people with low self-esteem.' By September 2013 - exactly two years after his suicide attempt - Nathan had dropped 14 stone, and has spent the last year dedicating his time to building the perfect body. Nathan now plans to enter body building competitions to showcase his transformation. Old ways: Before his lifestyle overhaul, Nathan was a sugar addict who gorged on bacon and egg butties, chocolate bars, alcohol and greasy takeaways, all of which he then quit cold turkey . 'I just want to show that it is possible to achieve what you want and it is never too late to get to where we want to be in life,' he said. 'I am so much happier now and my life at the moment has completely changed around from where it was three years ago.' He added: 'I am single but I do get attention from girls that I obviously wouldn't have got before. 'I want to show the people that bullied and harassed me that no matter how hard they beat me down, I will achieve more than them. 'If you\u2019re unhappy with yourself, nothing is impossible and you should follow your dreams to become the absolute best version of yourself.' Reformed: By September 2013 - exactly two years after his suicide attempt - Nathan had dropped 13 stone, and has spent the last year dedicating his time to building the perfect body .

A woman accused a married couple of rape after her boyfriend found out she had a threesome with them in a Travelodge hotel room. Hannah McWhirter, 21, of Banff, Aberdeenshire, engaged in the m\u00e9nage a trois with co-worker Dionne Clark and her husband Shaun in July 2013. She even exchanged texts with the couple after their threesome telling them how much she enjoyed herself. But when Mr Clark told the John Lewis department store worker's boyfriend about their hookup she claimed she had been raped. McWhirter appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where she admitted wasting police time with false rape claims. Fiscal depute Elaine Ward said the accused had become close friends with Mrs Clark, 29, after starting work in the same shop in January 2013. The court heard that over time Mrs Clark introduced McWhirter to her husband Shaun, 35. Mrs Ward said: 'Both Mr and Mrs Clark and the accused spent a lot of time together socially and exchanged texts and other media messages on a daily basis. 'The nature of their relationship became more intimate and in June 2013 they discussed having a threesome and booking a hotel for that purpose.' The court heard that on July 13 the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out, oblivious to what was going on. Mrs Ward said: 'On the following day the accused and Mrs Clark exchanged several text messages saying that they had enjoyed the previous night.' The fiscal depute said McWhirter and the Clarks continued to meet socially and appeared 'happy' in each other's company. McWhirter accused co-worker Dionne Clark and husband Shaun (pictured) of rape following the threesome . The court heard the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out . But the relationship started to deteriorate after McWhirter took a day to respond to a text from Mrs Clark about being admitted to hospital. Bosses at their work later found out about the incident but McWhirter denied that the threesome had happened during a meeting in September 2013. The court heard that a month later things took a turn for the worst. Mrs Ward said: 'On October 11, the accused's boyfriend was standing outside her place of work when Mr Clark advised him of the threesome and showed him text messages from the accused. 'This later resulted in the accused being confronted by her boyfriend. 'She initially denied that the incident had taken place, then admitted it but said it was forced.' The court heard their relationship ended and McWhirter returned to live with her mother - continuing to claim that the Clarks had raped her. McWhirter has now admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark (pictured on their wedding day) to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14 2013 . Police then began investigating her claims. McWhirter claimed she had been on a night out with friends before bumping into Mr and Mrs Clark. Mrs Ward said: 'She stated that at the end of the night she had to use the bathroom so went to their hotel room and then gave police details of a forcible rape.' The Clarks were interviewed under caution by police on October 16. However McWhirter's friends did not back up her night out story. After further mobile phone analysis took place in November 2013, McWhirter admitted she had been a willing participant. Yesterday she admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14, 2013. Sheriff Graham Buchanan deferred sentence until next month for the preparation of reports. McWhirter, who was released on bail, wept as she left the dock yesterday.",

The hosts had led through first-half goals by Robert Tesche and Clayton Donaldson, before Matt Derbyshire pulled one back for fourth-bottom Rotherham. However, Rob Kiernan's clumsy handling of Derbyshire near the hour mark saw the former City forward go down in the box only for referee Dean Whitestone to wave away appeals for a spot-kick, leaving the Millers boss visibly enraged as the home side held out. Robert Tesche of Birmingham City celebrates scoring the opening goal of the game . Tesche (centre) finished low to put Birmingham City ahead against Rotherham at St Andrews .

Andrew Shinnie was unfortunate to be flagged offside from Donaldson's early flick-on while winger Demarai Gray's ball into the box from the left was dangerous but fruitless. David Cotterill forced a good low save from Emiliano Martinez with a drive from just outside the area in the 19th minute as Gary Rowett's side continued to press. The deadlock was broken in the 27th minute with a well-worked but uncomplicated attack. Tesche found space just outside the box and after a one-two with Donaldson, side-footed coolly into the bottom-right corner to leave Martinez with no chance. Shinnie headed Cotterill's excellent cross over in the 38th minute after Donaldson's slight touch beforehand slightly changed the flight of the ball but eventually the second did come two minutes before the break. Cotterill hit a free-kick from distance with trademark power and accuracy and when Martinez palmed it back into play, rather than for a corner, Donaldson pounced with an easy diving header. Kirk Broadfoot of Rotherham United puts Clayton Donaldson of Birmingham City in a headlock . Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett watches the action from the sidelines of the Championship clash . Birmingham City's David Cotterill holds off challenge from Rotherham United's Ben Pringle (right) Donaldson fired a decent effort over on the turn as Blues sensed blood before the half was over. Rotherham gained a foothold less than three minutes into the second half, however. Slack defensive play left City goalkeeper Darren Randolph in bother and when he only palmed Lee Frecklington's shot to Derbyshire, the deficit was halved as the striker tapped home with ease. Frecklington then had a chance saved as Randolph kept out a deflected effort, while Martinez reacted quickly as Donaldson broke through at the other end. Colourful Millers boss Evans was incandescent with rage on the hour mark when his side were denied a penalty, with Derbyshire bearing down on goal only to go down when tangling with home defender Kiernan as the centre-half looked to atone for an error seconds earlier. Derbyshire was not far off with a 76th-minute header, while Donaldson and substitute Lloyd Dyer both came agonisingly close at point-blank range and Tesche twice fired straight at Martinez as the home side missed numerous chances to make the win more comfortable.",

Guardiola, who joined in 2013 after winning 14 titles in four seasons at Barcelona and taking a year out, has been a top target for several European clubs. The Spaniard, who won the domestic double last season, has repeatedly been linked with a possible move to last season's Premier League champions Manchester City. Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola will see out his three-year contract, claims Karl-Heinz Rummenigge . Speculation intensified in the days after Bayern's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final, first-leg loss at Porto last week and the subsequent departure of their long-time team doctor, who said his medical team was blamed for the defeat. But their 6-1 demolition of the Portuguese outfit on Tuesday saw Bayern book a semi-final spot with Guardiola on track for a treble of titles in his second season. 'I know very well that he will be the coach here at least until June 30, 2016,' Rummenigge told Bild. Guardiola celebrates during Bayern's 6-1 Champions League quarter-final victory against Porto . He said contract extension talks would take place in the second half of the year, following the end of the season. 'The aim is to extend Guardiola's contract and I think we have very good chances that he remains the coach here beyond 2016.' Recent contact between Guardiola and former Barcelona colleague Txiki Begiristain, who is now City's sports director, was no reason for concern for Bayern, Rummenigge said. The Bayern players celebrates after reaching the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday night . 'I am not worried about that. This just proves the quality of the coach. I am also aware that Begiristain worked with Guardiola at Barcelona at some point. 'But I cannot imagine that Pep would go to a club like Manchester City.' Bayern could win the Bundesliga title this weekend and take on Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final before their Champions League semi-final next month. Bayern have once before won the treble, in 2013, shortly before Guardiola's arrival.",

The 44-year-old, who is known for her wicked sense of humor, gets serious for Levo League's Ask4More\u00a0campaign, which calls for women to request the salaries that they deserve in honor of Equal Pay Day on April 14. 'I think the best person for the job should get jobs,' she says in the campaign video.\u00a0'I'm all for women having to work harder to prove themselves at this juncture if that's the way it is in the world. But if you work a job, and a man is working the same job, you should be getting paid the same.' Scroll down for video . Be confident: Sarah Silverman wants women to understand their worth as a part of Levo League's new\u00a0Ask4More campaign, which encourages women to request the salaries that they deserve . On average, women only earn 78 cents for every dollar made by men, and in the clip, the actress recalls a time when she was faced with an even worse pay margin because of her gender. Sarah explains that she and fellow comedian Todd Barry were doing back-to-back stand up sets on a Saturday night at the New York Comedy Club. Even though she says she was 'pretty well known at the time', she 'didn't think anything of it' when she was given $10 for her work. But when she was chatting with Todd outside, it soon came up that he was offered $60 for the same amount of work - at the same show. When she went back inside and asked Al Martin, the owner at the time, about the pay discrepancy, he thought that she was asking him to lend her money, saying: 'Oh, did you want a $60 spot?' Not right: In the video, Sarah recalls a time when she was paid $10 to do a stand-up routine, when a man who performed the same amount of time earned $60 . 'It was symbolic. I didn't need $60,' she says of that moment. 'You know, it\u2019s pretty sh****.' Sarah, who came under fire last month after she tweeted 'ten rape prevention tips' aimed at male attackers, says whenever she shares anything 'women's rights related' on social media, including equal pay and health care, she gets 'the most violent hate tweets back'. 'It's so odd. It's just bizarre,' she says. Sarah explains that knowing your self-worth is a big factor when it comes to women feeling confident to ask for more. 'My therapist says - and I think about it all the time - we don't get what we want. We get what we think we deserve,' she added. Double standard: The 44-year-old comedian, who is pictured at the\u00a02015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, says she gets 'the most violent hate tweets' when she discusses women's issues on Twitter . Sports fan: Sarah, who often plays basketball with men, was pictured with Anthony Anderson as they watched Sprite NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in New York City in February . She notes that the concept of asking for more and understanding your worth reminds of her of how she feels when she plays basketball with men. 'Every basket you miss is like missing 100 baskets and that comes from inside.' Sarah says she reminds herself that she isn't letting her team down, nor or the guys angry at her for missing a shot. The pressure she feels is being brought upon by herself. She explains that she finally realized that 'the guys shoot and miss all the time - most of the time - and they get better. 'We deserve quality lives with equality, and maybe control over our own human bodies without the government getting involved, to do whatever we get great at and do, and it has to come from inside and understanding that you deserve it and working to deserve it,' she says, before adding: \u2018Go ahead. Ask for more.' Sarah is a part of the nine-day campaign, which aims to empower women throughout their careers and includes other female celebrity supporters such as Amy Poehler, Chelsea Clinton and Constance Zimmer.",

The Argentinian \u2013 who has twice beaten testicular cancer - was not even named among the substitutes for Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs. Afterwards, Carver said Gutierrez was left out for \u2018selection reasons\u2019 before stating that he did not want to talk about the player. Jonas Gutierrez was dropped from squad for Sunday's defeat by Tottenham following row with John Carver . The 31-year-old had earlier posted a message on Twitter saying that he was not injured. Indeed, sources close to Gutierrez say that he was axed following a heated exchange with Carver. Gutierrez was upset when he was dropped from the starting XI for last week\u2019s 3-0 loss at Liverpool. He had been United\u2019s best player during the Tyne-Wear derby defeat at Sunderland in the previous game and was surprised by his omission, which was explained as a tactical switch to pair Jack Colback and Mehdi Abeid in midfield. What followed was a training-ground disagreement with Carver and Gutierrez tweeted on Thursday, \u2018I am tired about some things. I am Geordie. Newcastle deserves more\u2019. Meanwhile, a source added: \u2018They are treating him very badly. He does not deserve this. He just wants to play for Newcastle.\u2019 Gutierrez\u2019s contract is up in the summer and he will be let go after seven years at the club. The clause which meant he would be guaranteed an extension after eight starts this season cannot now be activated. However, Sportsmail also understands that Gutierrez trained with the first-team on Monday and will be in the squad for Saturday\u2019s visit of Swansea with both Carver and the player keen to move on from their dispute. The midfielder has long since been critical of his treatment by the Magpies after they told him to find a new club when he returned to Tyneside having beaten the cancer for the first time in November, 2013. Newcastle midfielder was given a heartfelt ovation when he appeared as a substitute at Anfield . Gutierrez was eventually loaned out to Norwich City for the remainder of the season. The cancer, however, returned last summer and he underwent a course of chemotherapy in Argentina. He returned to Newcastle in December and has made five appearances, the last of which came as a second-half substitute at Anfield when he was given a heartfelt ovation by the home fans. And, in an interview last month, Gutierrez spoke of his disappointment at the manner in which Newcastle had handled his illness. 'I won't be able to forgive the way I've been treated, no,\u2019 he said. Gutierrez will not be offered a new deal by Newcastle despite seven years at the club . 'I don't think it was the right time nor the circumstances and I think at times like that, you should look after the individual, the player. 'I returned mid-November (2013) and in December the manager said I should find myself another club, that it was best. I understand a lot of things about football that for the directors it is a business, no? 'It is clear that they look after the club's interests, but I think in a situation like that, you need to consider other things, even more as I had been playing for five years before having this problem. I was always playing. 'And I never asked for anything. I paid for it [medical treatment] because, for me, the most important thing was my health.'",

Speaking for the first time since Jordan Brennan's killer was jailed for eight months for manslaughter, Kim\u00a0reveals how her son was a 'cheeky chappy' and 'lots of fun', and would 'dance and sing all the time. He was a real show off'. However, the 43-year-old mother-of-five, from Gorton, Manchester, has slammed what she calls the lenient sentence, saying: 'There is no justice at all.' Jordan's heartbroken mum, Kim, 43, said: 'Jordan loved dancing \u2013 and he was killed because of it.'\u00a0She told of how her son longed to go on Britain's Got Talent, and how he had made a recording of an Ed Sheeran song . Jordan Brennan was attacked in September last year, as he left his local shop.\u00a0'His favourite question was: 'Have you got \u00a31 mum?'. In tribute, his mother Kim says they all threw a pound coin into his grave for him . Jordan was attacked in September 2014, after breaking into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy, but it enraged the other boy, 16, who thought his South East Asian ethnicity was being mocked. After claiming Jordan bumped into him as he spun round, the 16-year old attacker tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise - but the pair became involved in a tussle. As they struggled, Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters before his head hit the concrete floor below.\u00a0College student Jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up. He was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when Kim tried to raise him for breakfast. Tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. At Manchester Crown Court in March, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. Speaking about the incident for the first time, Kim said:\u00a0'His six-year-old sister had taught him a new dance on the day he died, and he was showing off in his local shop, in high spirits, which was typical of him.' Speaking about the incident for the first time, Kim said of Jordan: 'His six-year-old sister had taught him a new dance on the day he died, and he was showing off in his local shop, in high spirits, which was typical of him.' 'He always sang in front of the mirror and he loved admiring himself,' Kim Brennan (right) said of her son (left), who she added loved dancing and showing off . She told of how her son longed to go on Britain's Got Talent, and how he had made a recording of an Ed Sheeran song. 'He loved dancing to 'Gangnam Style' and The Shuffle, but that day, it cost him his life,' she said. She said that Jordan was a typical teenager, a keen footballer and fisherman, who loved girls, music, singing and fashion. Kim said: 'Jordan was a really cheeky chappy. He was lots of fun; he loved music and dancing and when Gangnam Style was released, he loved it. He would dance and sing all the time. He was a real show-off. 'He always sang in front of the mirror and he loved admiring himself. 'His favourite question was: \"Have you got \u00a31 mum?\". In tribute, we all threw a pound coin into his grave for him. It broke my heart.' Kim said Jordan, pictured holding his baby sister, always sang in front of the mirror and loved admiring himself . His mother Kim says she went to the local shop in Gorton, Manchester to see what had happened. The shop owner confirmed Jordan had been dancing the shuffle and 'Gangnam Style' before he was attacked by a stranger who had then disappeared . Jordan's mum, Kim, says the killer's eight month sentence is an insult to her son's memory . On the day that Jordan died in September last year, his little sister, Millie, six, had taught him to do a dance called 'The Shuffle'. Kim said: 'The pair of them were dancing in the kitchen and they had me in stitches laughing. 'Millie kept saying to him: \"Don't bend your knees\". 'Eventually, he got the hang of it and he and Millie were messing around and laughing.' Early in the evening, Jordan went out with his friend, Lewis. Kim said: 'Jordan came back and said that someone in the local shop had hit him because he was dancing. He was rubbing his neck so I checked him over thoroughly but he seemed fine. 'He seemed a bit tipsy and I told him off and said he'd have a hangover in the morning. 'It was only after he died that I found out he wasn't tipsy at all - he had a head injury. I just presumed, like a typical 17-year-old, he had sneaked a couple of drinks. 'I torture myself that I didn't take him to hospital.' Kim herself went to the local shop to see what had happened, and the shop owner confirmed Jordan had been dancing the shuffle and Gangnam Style before he was attacked by a stranger who had then disappeared. Kim said: 'Jordan seemed OK, he ate dinner and went to bed but was sick during the night. Again, I thought it was perhaps alcohol, and so I cleaned him up, helped him change his pyjamas, and he went back to sleep. 'I looked in on him again when I went to the toilet at around 3am and he was fine.' But at 8.30am, when Kim and her daughter Millie went to wake him, Jordan was dead. Kim said: 'Millie and me went into his room as usual; she was full of beans and she was armed with a deodorant because she always complained that Jordan's feet smelled. Jordan's family and friends walk past the funeral procession . Jordan's mother Kim said she knew there was something wrong when she found him lying in bed. Pictured, friends and family at his funeral . 'But I knew, from one look at his face, that there was something dreadfully wrong.' Kim called an ambulance as she frantically tried to resuscitate her son. Police inquiries revealed that Jordan had been attacked as he left the shop, with his killer pushing, pulling and kicking him, causing him to fall twice, banging his head on metal shutters and again on the pavement. Kim said: 'I had to move out of the house whilst forensics took over. It was horrendous. Millie kept asking for her big brother. Our whole family was devastated.' A now 17-year-old youth was charged with murder, but prosecutors accepted a guilty plea to manslaughter, concluding he could not be proven he intended to kill. The court heard the 'flashpoint' for the fatal incident was Jordan 'dancing and making reference to 'Gangnam Style'. The attacker claimed he took the remarks as 'racist' and 'mocking' because of his ethnicity. But prosecutor Rob Hall said Jordan may simply have been 'in high spirits and exuberant' and that he was of good character and there was nothing at all to suggest his actions were racist. The youth was jailed for just eight months, leaving Kim and her family devastated. Kim said: 'For the killer to say he took Jordan's dance as racist or offensive is disgusting. Jordan was just dancing, as he always did, regardless of who was watching. 'Jordan was killed because he had a sense of fun, that's all there is to it. It's a disgrace that his killer is allowed to say such things when my son isn't here to talk for himself. 'There is no justice at all. The sentence is an insult to Jordan's memory.'",

From red walls to bright white lightbulbs and clutter under the bed, there are many things you may never have considered that are preventing you from getting a good night's rest. A new infographic from London furniture company Made.com shows scientifically proven tactics you can use to change the layout of your room. Sleep experts recommended you arrange your room symmetrically, install heavy curtains and keep pets out . If you're having trouble sleeping it could be down to the interior design of your bedroom . Sleep experts recommended you arrange your room symmetrically, install heavy curtains\u00a0and keep pets out to get a more restful slumber. You should also dim your light three hours before bedtime and stop using gadgets and hour before you hit the sack. Read on for a detailed breakdown of your step-by-step guide to perfect bedtime feng shui. FURNITURE ARRANGEMENTS . Ninety-one per cent of Britons say their sleep environment impacts their sleep. Though we often don't realise, our surroundings affect us in powerful ways. So arrange your bedroom to comfort your body and relax your mind. According to Made.com's tips below: 1. Install a ceiling fan. The ideal temperature for sleep is 18-21C. 2. Open a window just a crack to let air circulate. 3. Add blinds and thick, dark curtains to keep the light out. 4. Plush rugs and cushions muffle noise. 5. Create symmetry matching pairs. 6. Add plants, art or photos of nature and natural materials. 7. Eliminate clutter by investing in cabinets, drawers and storage. 8. Ditch the TV. Fill your space with something beautiful. We spend nearly a third of our lives sleeping. Yet many people don't realise just how sensitive our bodies are during these vital hours of rest. The space we sleep in has a huge effect on the quantity and quality of our sleep - and therefore the quality of our waking lives. After all, when we're not properly rested, our brainpower, digestion, reflexes and much more suffers. Better interior design really can help you get a better night's sleep. SLEEP EXPERTS SAY... LIGHTING THE PATH TO REST . Our bodies have evolved to respond to ambient light. Warm hued rays from the setting sun signal that it's time to sleep, while blue daylight releases hormones to make us alert. Now that we live much of our lives under artificial light, we must mirror these natural light spectrums to keep our circadian rhythms in harmony. According to the infographic, try shutting off computers, TVs and smartphones before going to bed. Make sure your bedroom is in complete darkness, and us low-wattage bulbs after sundown. Avoid blue lights and use lamps with warm yellow, gold or reddish light. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COLOUR . Just as bright red signals danger in nature, all colours have an impact on our psychology. So paint and decorate your bedroom in soothing hues for better sleep and deeper relaxation. Blues, greens and greys are said to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, and promote better sleep. But reds, yellows and oranges increase heart rate and blood pressure so discourage relaxation. PILLOWS AND MATTRESSES: BETTER BEDDING . From the way it feels on your skin to the way it traps allergens to the way it aligns our spines, bedding has a tremendous impact on sleep. If you're a side sleeper, use a firm pillow to get a good night's rest. But, if you like to lie on your back, a medium-firm pillow will promote the best quality shut-eye - for those snoozing on their fronts, a soft pillow is recommended. According to the infographic, the average person move 40-60 times during the night - and so it's recommended to change a mattress every seven to eight years.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)I will always remember when things turned. I was 12 years old, and my younger sister and I were with our parents attending a peaceful demonstration in downtown Miami near the courthouse. We were there to protest the acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of unarmed motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie. I had learned the word \"acquittal\" just that day. It meant they wouldn't be held responsible. Community leaders were gathered at the front, speaking to a crowd that was in shock and full of anger and despair. The trial had been covered extensively, and nobody could believe that the fatal beating -- with the extent of the physical wounds to McDuffie's head and body -- could be justified or excused. I started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd. There was shouting and cursing. Bottle throwing. Then a car was turned over and set on fire. That was Miami 35 years ago, but it could just as easily have been Baltimore this week. The Miami riots of 1980 were the first major \"race riots\" since the wave of riots spread across the nation in the 1960s. Harlem 1964: Police shooting of 15-year-old James Powell. Watts 1965: Arrest of 21-year-old Marquette Frye for drunken driving. Newark 1967: Police beating of John Smith while under arrest. Detroit 1967: Police raid on a \"blind pig\" after-hours bar. Then the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, and Baltimore and 125 other cities erupted in flames. The immediate catalysts for the waves of riots in the 1960s before the death of Dr. King were police action, or, more specifically, perceived unjust police action. That was true in Miami in 1980 after the acquittal of the police officers. And the same in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers for the beating of motorist Rodney King. Wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the start of the Los Angeles riots. And now we have Baltimore 2015, with the death of suspect Freddie Gray in police custody. My parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement, and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement. It was the images of young people all over the country -- often facing physical danger, discipline from their parents and suspension from school -- that propelled the civil rights movement into the national spotlight. Juxtapose decades-old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in Birmingham and Selma with Tuesday's images of Baltimore youths throwing rocks at police, and you wonder what has happened. As a 12-year-old girl in Miami, I didn't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods, and risk going to jail, by rioting. I was afraid because I didn't see my father for days as he and other community leaders walked the streets to try to restore calm. I was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the African-American community, causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels. But two months ago, I agreed to moderate a panel at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights called \"Riot -- The Voice of the Unheard?\" The occasion was to mark the Atlanta premiere of \"Detroit '67,\" a play written by Dominique Morisseau and directed by Kamilah Forbes that chronicled the journey of a family as they lived through the turmoil of the Detroit '67 riot, including the joy and love they found with one another. The play and the panel were programmed by Kenny Leon's True Colors Theatre Company, a nonprofit devoted to presenting artistic interpretations with diverse voices so that individuals and institutions can have a shared platform in their quest for understanding in American society. Inspired by the mission, I had recently joined the board. Although pegged to the past, the purpose of the panel was to examine how current events relating to police actions against African-American men could potentially lead to rioting and what could be done to prevent it. I learned that some questioned whether riots are actually purposeless and uncontrolled violence, or whether they are purposeful uprisings against individuals and institutions. I learned that those who participate in riots often feel hopeless and dehumanized, both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots. I learned that riots in the 1960s played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda, often by galvanizing local and national government officials to work with peaceful community, church and civil rights leaders to address the root causes of riots. This is a controversial part of our civil rights history that has been sanitized. At the conclusion of the 1967 Detroit riot, President Lyndon Johnson condemned the violence but said in his address to the nation that: \"This is not a time for angry reaction. It is a time for action, starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities. The strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the street. ...\" His administration convened the Kerner Commission to examine the 1965-68 riots, and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness, poverty, a lack of political power, unfair housing, police brutality and inferior schools. After the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, the Christopher Commission was established and concluded that racial profiling and excessive force, unjust treatment in the criminal justice system, poor housing, and the lack of jobs and education were triggers for the riots. After all of these riots, the affected city, state and national governments enacted plans and programs to address some of these underlying conditions. Maybe the Baltimore youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in Watts in 1965. As recounted in \"The Great Rebellion\" by Kenneth Stahl, Dr. King went to Watts to try to calm tensions, and a hostile youth said to him:  \"We won.\" King challenged him: \"How have you won? Homes are destroyed, blacks are dead in the streets, stores you shop from for food and clothes are destroyed.\" The young man replied, \"We won because we made the whole world pay attention ... the police chief and mayor had never been here. We made them come.\" Dr. King would say near the end of his life: \"It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.\" When I learned that Baltimore high school students planned a purge based on the movie \"The Purge,\" in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes, it suddenly made sense. They thought they wouldn't be held responsible for their crimes. They thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word \"acquitted\" I learned the day of the Miami riots. But they got it wrong. They will forever live the repercussions of their actions, regardless of the impetus. But the Rev. Jamal Bryant got it right when he said he would open his Empowerment Temple AME Church in Baltimore to youths who would not be in school so he could teach them the power of nonviolence to change society. That power was evident after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the decision not to indict the officer who killed him. Those protests were mostly peaceful. And the government responded -- not out of fear of violence, but because of a desire to change the conditions that led to the protests. After several months of investigation, the far-reaching Justice Department report on Ferguson issued in March concluded that the use of policing to raise revenue, combined with a systemic racial bias, had led to a pattern and practice of discrimination and Fourth, 14th, Sixth and First Amendment rights violations against African-Americans in Ferguson. The report made recommendations that the Ferguson Police Department, as well as other departments across the country, should enact to improve police relations in communities of color. The riots in Baltimore have rightfully been quashed, but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard.",

In addition to telling Michelle Obama that public school children can't live on one packet of ketchup alone, Peter criticizes the First Lady for America's lack of troops in the Middle East and in the Ukraine. He also suggests that the United States bomb Syria. Dear Michelle Obama:\u00a0An eight-year-old boy named Peter penned a letter to health conscious Michelle Obama to tell her one ketchup packet at lunch simply is not enough and that the United States should bomb Syria . Dear Michelle Obama, . My name is Peter. I am eight years old. I love studying history of the U.S.A. I have enjoyed learning about the great choices the USA has made\u2026 . And then their was your husbands election. I think you should rethink your idea that takes us to one ketchup packet per meal. I feel it is taking away from our patriotism toward America. I also think you should stop doing nothing and go send some troops to the Middle East. I also think your husband needs to work on his speeches. He also disappointed millions of Americans by not bombing Syria. If you do not know thousands of peoples homes are destroyed by ISIS in the Middle East. You should also get the UN to send troops to Ukraine. Also may I ask you, is the White House comfortable? Thank you for your time and consideration . Signed, . A concerned 8 year old citizen, . Peter . 'My name is Peter. I am eight years old,' reads the letter. 'I love studying the history of the USA. I have enjoyed learning about the great choices the USA has made\u2026 And then there was your husband\u2019s election. I think you should rethink your idea that takes us to one ketchup packet per meal. I feel that it is taking away our patriotism toward America,' he writes. Peter then writes Michelle Obama that her husband president Obama needs to 'work on his speeches.' Not only does Peter criticize Obama's speeches, he offers his bull dog view on American foreign policy. 'I also think you should stop doing nothing and go send some troops to the Middle East,' says the letter. Health crusader: Michelle Obama has set health guidelines in place at schools to fight the nation's obesity problem but has been criticized for not offering enough funding . 'I also think your husband needs to work on his speeches. He also disappointed millions of Americans by not bombing Syria. If you do not know every day thousands of people\u2019s homes are destroyed by the ISIS in the Middle East. You should also get the U.N. to send troops to Ukraine[e],' the letter continues. Peter's father told The Weekly Standard that he found the letter on his son's desk and that it took his boy months to angrily write it. Peter's mother said that her son does not need to worry about having just one ketchup packet at lunch because he goes to a private school. That's when Peter apparently precociously told his parents he wanted to 'give a voice to the voiceless,' reports The Weekly Standard. The end of Peter's letter alluded to the First Family's cushy accommodations. 'Is the White House comfortable?' concludes the letter from 'a concerned citizen.' Not so filling: Public school students around the country have posted their paltry lunches to criticize Michelle Obama for her health guidelines they say are making them hungry .",

Wayne Rooney, Sir Stanley Matthews, Duncan Edwards and Peter Shilton are all veterans of the long-contested Under 16 tournament between the different associations within the United Kingdom. England are the most successful team in the history of the Victory Shield, but it has been announced that they will not be fielding a side in the competition. The Football Association have taken the decision to withdraw from future Victory Shield tournaments . Wales are the current holders of the Victory Shield while England are the most successful country . 2010-11: England . 2011-12: England . 2012-13: England . 2013-14: Scotland . 2014-15: Wales . A statement from the Football Association says the move 'ensures consistency with a key element of the England DNA', with the move borne out of the desire to aid development by facing opposition from further afield. It is understood the decision has been sped up by Sky Sports' move to withdraw funding and propose an altered format, with Gareth Southgate, the FA's head of national teams at St George's Park, saying player development is the key reason. 'We are reviewing our fixture programme at all ages and it is important that with England we are able to give players an international experience that compliments their club development and attempts to expose them to something different,' he said. 'At Under 16 level we may only have the boys for between 10 to 15 matches per season. Within that programme, it's important to prioritise exposing them to European and world opposition. 'We feel that within their club programmes, they face many of the boys that they would face in the Victory Shield and so these fixtures, whilst competitive and exciting, do not expose our boys to different playing cultures. 'Although we recognise the historic interest in these matches, we are intent on maximising the football learning of our young players, while forming the programme of fixtures for the year around the crucial academic commitments our players face at this age group. 'We also feel that due to the changes in format, uncertainty around the Victory Shield and the potential changes suggested by Sky, it is a good time to review our fixtures and make an early decision so everyone can plan their 2015-16 fixtures with certainty.'

The A-list couple want to install air-con in five rooms including the luxury gym and large wine cellar at the \u00a331.5 million west London home. But one neighbour was furious with the proposals, claiming it 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. Another Beckham victory:\u00a0David and Victoria have won a planning battle against their next-door neighbour over proposals to install air-conditioning at their new mansion in west London . Portfolio: The couple, pictured, have won planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence. They already have homes in California, France and Dubai . The neighbour expressed 'deep concerns' about the impact of noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from the construction. But other locals gave their support to the Beckhams and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council has approved the plans subject to minor conditions. A report from the council said the air-conditioning would have minimal impact on the significance of the listed building and the noise from the units would comply with the borough's criteria. Jonathan Bore, the executive director for planning and development, said: 'The proposals would safeguard the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, would preserve the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, and would have an acceptable impact on trees.' The Beckhams bought the grand property in Holland Park for \u00a331.5 million in cash in 2013. With the help of designer Rose Uniacke, they are restoring the Grade II listed mansion to its former glory. It is a slow process with photos sent to the council last year showing the house had been stripped ahead of its overhaul. Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria's shoe collection . Architect's impression: When ready, the property will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room. When ready, the property will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room. The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. There is also a separate mews house at the foot of the garden which will also be renovated. One local described the plans as a 'prudent and sensible set of alterations which will add to the value of the property over the long term'. A neighbour nearby added that councils should be encouraging the likes of the Beckhams to 'restore these beautiful houses to their former glory'. Estate agents have estimated the property could be worth as much as \u00a342 million when completed. Old pad: The Beckhams reportedly sold their former house in Hertfordshire, dubbed Beckingham Palace, pictured, for \u00a311.5million - making an estimated \u00a39million profit .",

Hazard has played 48 games this season for club and country, missing just five matches for Chelsea and being an ever-present in their Barclays Premier League title charge. But as Belgium struggled to a hard-fought 1-0 win over Israel in European Championship qualifying group B, Hazard was withdrawn by manager Marc Wilmots with 28 minutes to go having found it difficult to get the better of his marker Orel Dgani. Eden Hazard has admitted an intense campaign with Chelsea may have left him too tired to perform at his best . Hazard was substituted with 28 minutes In Belgium's 1-0 win over Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday night . The 24-year-old playmaker has played all but five of Chelsea's games this season, mainly avoiding injury . The 24-year-old playmaker was clearly unhappy to have been substituted and looked to shoot Wilmots a disapproving look as he left the field to be replaced by Nacer Chadli before questioning the manager on his decision after the game. \u2018I was a little bit surprised to be substituted,' Hazard said. 'Also, I was a little bit unhappy and I think you could see that I was unhappy. \u2018I asked the coach for a reason and he told me that I was tired. Maybe I was a little bit tired. I\u2019ve played a lot of games this season.\u2019 In his post-match comments,\u00a0Wilmots added: \u2018Hazard is not hurt, but I had the impression that he was tired. In these kind of games, you have to react immediately because we did not have time.' Belgium manager Marc Wilmots said he felt that Hazard looked tired, something the player questioned him on . Hazard scored early on in Chelsea's last game, a 3-2 win over Hull City, but the team were pegged back . Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action on Saturday . Belgium captain Vincent Kompany was sent off for a second yellow card within two minutes of Hazard's withdrawal, leaving Belgium clinging on to their slender lead, and Wilmots admitted he may not have substituted his star man had he known his side would be down to 10 men. Despite his admission, Hazard is unlikely to get an extended rest any time soon as he returns to Premier League action with the visit of Stoke City to Stamford Bridge on Saturday. And with a tough run-in and another international break still to come, the Belgian forward could rack up as many as 59 appearances by the time the season finally ends in mid-June. Belgium's win in Jerusalem saw them return to the top of their qualifying group, ahead of Wales on goal difference. They travel to face them in Cardiff in their next competitive game on June 12. Marouane Fellaini (left) celebrates his goal with Vincent Kompany, Axel Witsel and Christian Benteke (L-R) But Kompany was later sent off and Wilmots admitted he may not have substituted Hazard two minutes later .",

There is a third path. We can cooperate with the world.\" Rouhani said his government kept its word to Iranians when negotiating the framework deal, which was agreed upon Thursday and sets parameters for talks that could lead to a comprehensive deal by a June 30 deadline. Chief among them is that Iran would keep at least some centrifuges and no longer face international sanctions. He thanked Iranians for their patience and for \"resisting\" by standing up for the country's rights. As to the rest of the world, the Iranian President said he thinks most now realize that Iran \"is pursuing peaceful objectives.\" That means trying to develop nuclear energy, not nuclear weapons, as many feared. That fear, combined with distrust of Iran's leaders, spurred the sanctions and the Middle Eastern nation's isolation. \"We do not lie,\" Rouhani said, vowing that Iran will be true to its word, \"provided the other parties will implement their own promises.\" What Iranians think of the deal . Those promises include reducing Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98% for 15 years and significantly scaling back its number of installed centrifuges. Still, while it will be shrunken and centralized, Iran's nuclear program won't go away. What should happen -- assuming there's a common view that Tehran is doing as required -- is that countries will end their sanctions. That was non-negotiable for Iran, with Rouhani saying the deal shows his government's commitment to removing a major \"obstacle ... for business\" by addressing the world's worries about its nuclear program. \"We need economic productivity, employment for the youth and development of non-oil products,\" he said. \"Thus our people can witness better things for their welfare.\" It won't be easy, of course, to get Iran and the P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- on the same page regarding the nitty-gritty details of any final agreement, if there is one. After all, it took two extra days past a self-imposed deadline for the parties to reach a framework deal. What's in the deal? 7 key points . That agreement followed about a decade of often failed negotiations and deep-rooted acrimony, particularly between Iran and the United States. Those tensions haven't disappeared, nor is there any guarantee that talks won't fall apart again over the next three months. Even as he applauded what he called a \"good deal,\" President Barack Obama pointed out Thursday that \"if Iran cheats, the world will know it.\" His government is also being pressed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who blasted the agreement Friday as posing a \"grave danger\" by legitimizing Iran's nuclear program and making it easier for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. On the Iranian side, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has acknowledged that \"mutual mistrust\" has long plagued talks. He notes Iran still has \"serious differences with the United States,\" even after Thursday's agreement. Still, Rouhani expressed hopes Friday the nuclear negotiations will change that by further opening up Iran to the rest of world, including long-standing adversaries. \"We do shake hands with them. ... Even those countries we have tensions with, we would like an end to the animosity,\" he said. \"Cooperation and interaction would be in the interest of everyone.\" Netanyahu: Iran must recognize Israel's right to exist .",

Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 . 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video . The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 . Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National . Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding.\u00a0And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to \u00a310,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household. Waley-Cohen is a Celebrity Ambassador for The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) and was famously pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge at the Roller Disco he organised to raise money for a ward in memory of his brother.",

Kenny Jackett\u2019s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory.

With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday\u2019s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds\u2019 banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett\u2019s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves\u2019 rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder\u2019s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price\u2019s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt\u2019s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of \u2018leave it\u2019 could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald\u2019s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place.

In a drastic step which will be studied closely in Britain, MPs particularly highlighted the irresponsibility of fashion websites which encourage women to keep their weight as low as possible. Now these \u2018pro-anorexia\u2019 sites will face a year in prison and a fine equivalent to just over \u00a37,000. Deputies in the National Assembly in Paris voted through the amendment to a law on public health and it is expected to be rubber-stamped by the Senate. Scroll down for video . Unhealthy: French MPs have voted to punish anyone who 'incites' people to become dangerously thin with a year in prison and fines of up to \u00a37,000 weeks after rejecting  a ban on super-skinny models . It singled out those who 'provoke people to excessive thinness by encouraging prolonged dietary restrictions that could expose them to a danger of death, or directly impair their health.' Around 40,000 people suffer from anorexia in France, the vast majority women and teenage girls. Maud Olivier and Catherine Coutelle, the MPs who proposed the law, said in a joint statement that 'certain sites known as pro-Ana can push people into a vicious circle of anorexia and authorities cannot do anything about it.' They said the new law was not designed to threaten 'freedom of expression on the Internet', but was a long overdue health reform. Anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of a psychiatric disorder and is extremely difficult to treat. In March, MPs in France rejected a proposal that would have seen ultra-slim models banned from the fashion runways. However, the MP behind the planned law has vowed the fight is not over. At the time, Olivier Veran said: 'I believe that models should eat well and look after their health. French socialist politician Olivier Veran (pictured) has vowed to continue the fight to ban ultra-thin models from the catwalk in France . 'This is an important message to young women who see these models as an aesthetic example'. He also proposed a new law that punish the 'glorification of anorexia', especially online. France's National Union of Modelling Agencies (SYNAM), has complained that new laws could harm the competitiveness of French modelling. A SYNAM statement read: 'French modelling agencies are in permanent competition with their European counterparts. As a result, a European approach is needed.' The French legislation comes after countries including Spain, Italy and Brazil have all clamped down on skinny models at catwalk shows. Spain has barred models below a certain body mass index from the Madrid fashion shows, while Italy has insisted on health certificates for fashion show participants. And Brazil is considering demands to ban underage, underweight models from its catwalks. Medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models, and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner, which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six. Fashion guru Giorgio Armani said recently that the fashion industry had a duty to 'work together against anorexia'. He added: \"The industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women.' French restaurants are to be banned from offering free fizzy drinks refills to customers. MPs in the National Assembly voted to back the measure, which is aimed at cutting down on obesity. The ban applies to all fizzy drinks sold in places open to the public, whether they are fast food chains, bars, caf\u00e9s or conventional restaurants. The amendment to a health bill written by UDI MP Arnaud Richard reads: \u2018It is the role of the law to fix a framework to protect the population against commercial competition which aims to make something free to entice customers and encourage them to consume unhealthy products excessively.\u2019 It has won the backing of Health Minister Marisol Touraine, and public health campaigners worried about increasing obesity in France. Ms Touraine said: \u2018This habit is common in other countries and it is increasingly taking hold in France.' Free refills are the norm in most American restaurants, and were were introduced by Quick, one of France\u2019s most popular fast-food chains, last year. Customers are given an empty cup with their food and they are then free to serve themselves from the soda fountains. Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants also introduced the marketing ploy.",

The attorneys had originally asked for a 35 percent settlement fee, however the ruling by a Baltimore judge means they will only receive 17.25 per cent. Dr. Nikita Levy was fired from John Hopkins Health System in February 2013 after it was discovered he had\u00a0surreptitiously videotaped and photographed thousands of women during gynecological exams . In his order the judge praised the attorneys for achieving 'extraordinary results,' and called the settlement 'unprecedented.' Jonathan Schochor, the suit's lead attorney, says he and the other attorneys won't challenge the judge's order. Dr. Levy was fired in February 2013, days after a co-worker alerted hospital authorities about her suspicions and he was forced to turn over the camera. He committed suicide ten days later. Investigators discovered roughly 1,200 videos and 140 images stored on a series of servers in his home. The settlement is one of the largest settlements on record in the U.S. involving sexual misconduct by a physician, and all but closes a case that never produced criminal charges but threatened the reputation of one of the world's leading medical institutions. Lawyers said thousands of women were traumatized, even though their faces were not visible in the images and it could not be established with certainty which patients were recorded or how many. He committed suicide ten days later. Investigators discovered roughly 1,200 videos and 140 images stored on a series of servers in his home . Hospital authorities called Baltimore police just before Levy's firing. Police and federal investigators said they found no evidence he shared the material with others. Levy, 54, graduated from the Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan, and completed his internship and residency at Kings County Hospital Center. He began working at Hopkins in 1988. When the allegations came to light, he was working at Hopkins East Baltimore Medical Center, a community practice affiliated with Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Enter 'Retrosweat'. Founded by former NIDA graduate Shannon Dooley, 30, the aerobics classes with a twist are all about 'making fitness fabulous'. Described as 'freestyle aerobic workout,'\u00a0Retrosweat\u00a0is inspired by the era of old-school VHS workouts made famous by Jane Fonda, and involves choreography to match the Eighties soundtrack. Scroll down for video . Getting physical: Shannon Dooley has founded 'Retrosweat' - an Eighties-inspired aerobics class in the style of Jane Fonda's iconic workouts . Skin and pins: Typical Retrosweat attire is all about showing off your legs in skimpy Eighties leotards . Pop it like it's hot: A Retrosweat class will have you popping, squatting and grinding to a retro soundtrack . A 50-minute workout, it has 12 dance tracks and Dooley regularly mixes up the soundtrack to keep people excited each week - and on their toes. 'There's a fusion of jogging, jumping, athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing' says Dooley. 'Basically there's a warm up, warm down, both high and medium impact movement that targets all areas of the body. 'There will be a leg track with squats and lunges and an arm track with push ups.' Eighties alter ego: Dooley says class goers  tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows . Iconic: Olivia Newton-John's aerobic anthem Let's Get Physical inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble . 'Being freestyle though, I like to change up the tracks and let people request songs, but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week.' It\u00a0also promises to have you 'sweating litres, laughing loads and getting buns of steel and a core to die for.' And according to Dooley, there's nothing else like it on the market. 'What makes it different is it's theatrical - people can come into a space that\u2019s all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour,' says Dooley. 'Not to mention being physically and creatively expressive while getting exercise they need.' And it's not just for those stuck in a Eighties time warp either. Tutti Frutti - In Summer Dooley adds 'Pineapple squat challenge' a modern take on a kettlebell workout . 'The demographic is quite wide. We have girls in their early twenties that come, ladies in their thirties, ladies in their forties who used to listen to Eighties music during high school, women in early sixties who are relieved freestyle movement is back and who used to do it five times a week in the Eighties.' 'Oh and we definitely have men come along too,  they love it.' Overall Dooley says people just like to come along because they love Eighties music, want to put an amazing costume on, feel fabulous - and release endorphins - 'It\u2019s one big healthy party!' When asked where she got her inspiration,  surprisingly it wasn't from watching her mum do Jane Fonda workouts. Diva demographic: Dooley say there's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties . 'No strangely. My mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes I watched my mum do tap exams,' says Dooley. 'She is though an amazing choreographer so that\u2019s where I get my inspiration from.' As for attire?\u00a0'I wouldn\u2019t turn away anyone who isn\u2019t in a leotard,' laughs Dooley. 'But as people come back, gradually each week they will start to build collection. A leotard from eBay, leg warmers from American Apparel and after a while they build this whole alter ego and when then they will come in wearing a G-string leotard and no one will even blink.' On her own wardrobe, Dooley takes her job very seriously, admitting she's never worn the same outfit twice, 'an I've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now' - (65 leotards to be precise). Fit and fun: Dooley says unlike  treadmill workouts, Retrosweat is about having fun and forgetting it's fitness . 'I like to set the standards through my face, hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves,' she says. Aside from the costumes, music and theatrics, Dooley also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off Seventies and Nineties classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers. 'In summer, we do the pineapple squat challenge - so someone in the room will hold a pineapple in the squat track (which weighs about 2kgs) and it works just like a kettlebell, except your using the resistance of pineapple. Fonda fitspo: Dooley credits Jane Fonda as one of her main sources of inspiration behind Retrosweat . 'When we do Seventies class I will mix it up with a disco ball!' Dooley says the Seventies and Nineties nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves, as well as give herself a break from Eighties decade for a bit. 'Nineties goes off, we dance to fresh prince and that classic song \u2018Sing hallelujah!\u2019 So with all this fun and flair, how does the fitness measure up? 'For me, other than getting people to smile, escape life for an hour and enjoy themselves, the best feedback I get is about fitness. People will say, I lost four kilos and I didn't even notice!' says Dooley. 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves': Dooley says those with two left feet won't have any difficulty . 'A lot of exercise these days is scientific, counting reps and scooping protein powder. I respect that but that\u2019s not me. My exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun, and I know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine,' says Dooley. 'People want variation, they want a ballad and they want to go nuts when the chorus hits. And the great thing about using songs is they're only 3.5-4 minutes long so there\u2019s comfort in the fact you\u2019re jumping up and down  but there's \u2018just one more chorus\u2019 and then we\u2019ll be done.' So for Dooley it all just boils down to getting people excited and wanting to have a 'bodacious body.' 'I love seeing people improve their quality of life through the magic of music and star jumps - as sentimental as that sounds.' As for those with two left feet, Dooley says you won't have any trouble. Baby one more time: Every now and again a Seventies or Nineties class is thrown into the mix, which Dooley says 'go off' 'My class is all about the simplicity of moves. I think it's much more enjoyable to do simple moves well and enjoy it than struggle with something complicated and not enjoy it. So whether you've never danced or are a dancer who wants to keep their skills up,  Retrosweat is all about simplicity and completely inclusive.' And it seems this 'blast from the past' class is only growing. Dooley now runs additional side business 'Dial-a-sweat' where she takes hens parties for a class, and has travelled all around Sydney from Bowral, Newport and Kirrabilli overlooking the harbour bridge. And with two current locations in Alexandria and Surry Hills that run weekly (and Bondi for a while), Dooley believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things. 'I want the whole world Retrosweating, that\u2019s the plan.' 'And if I have too much make-up on and have sweat running on my face then that\u2019s all part of it.'",

The journalist who wrote Rolling Stone's flawed account of a campus rape is set to apologize Sunday night, when the Columbia Journalism School publishes a review of what went wrong with her reporting. Sabrina Rubin Erdely has been silent since December, when the magazine was forced to issue an apology in the wake of several factual errors highlighted in the piece about a University of Virginia student named Jackie. In the story, titled 'A Rape on Campus', Jackie claims to have been gang raped by seven men at campus fraternity Phi Kappa Psi two years ago. But a recent investigation by the Charlottesville Police found no evidence to support her story- including the fact that the man who brought her to the fraternity the night of the alleged incident doesn't seem to exist. The Columbia Graduate School of Journalism will release their review of the botched Rolling Stone investigation at 8pm on Sunday. Following that, sources tell CNN\u00a0that Erdely will release an apologetic statement and Rolling Stone will take the story down from their website. While the article initially sparked protests on campus, Erdely's reporting quickly began to fall apart as the Washington Post and  local outlets started following up on the allegations. One mistake of Erdely's previously highlighted, was the fact she agreed not to contact Jackie's alleged attackers. Scroll down for video . Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named \u00a0Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Three of Jackie's friends also denied Erdely's assertion that they discouraged the alleged victim from reporting the assault. By December 5, Rolling Stone acknowledged that there appeared 'to be discrepancies in Jackie's account.' The magazine asked for the independent review, which was conducted by the dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. The fraternity has called the article defamatory and said it was exploring its legal options. 'These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault,' said Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, after the Charlottesville police suspended their investigation. Despite its flaws, the article heightened scrutiny of campus sexual assaults amid a campaign by President Barack Obama. The University of Virginia had already been on the Department of Education's list of 55 colleges under investigation for their handling of sex assault violations. The article also prompted UVA President Teresa Sullivan to temporarily suspend Greek social events. Fraternities later agreed to ban kegs, hire security workers and keep at least three fraternity members sober at each event.",

The couple were all smiles as Lampard enjoyed a day off from training with current club Manchester City ahead of their weekend Premier League clash at home to West Ham United. Frank Lampard made a return to Chelsea as he walked down King's Road with fiancee Christine Bleakley . To date, the midfielder has made 32 appearances for City in all competitions on loan this season from MLS outfit New York City - scoring seven goals. Lampard will be joining his parent club in July, as New York currently continue play their debut season in the MLS without their marquee signing. And looking ahead to Lampard's arrival in America, former Everton and Manchester City midfielder Adrian Heath believes Lampard and LA Galaxy-bound Steven Gerrard are in for a few culture shocks when they move stateside. 'They will have to get used to the travel for an away game. Six hour flights leaving on Thursday and not arriving back until Sunday night. The time difference, sleep patterns,' he told Sportsmail.

A fantasist prowler who harassed young women, traumatising them after scaling the walls of trendy apartment blocks where they lived, has been banned from the area nearby for five years. Matthew Hall, 25, climbed onto the balconies in \u00a0of his victims in Manchester's fashionable Northern Quarter district\u00a0and hid, asking when confronted 'am I scaring you?' and 'you're dead sexy - can I come in?' In one case he walked into his victim's bedroom as she slept in the early hours, making off when she switched the light on and saw him. Hall now risks arrest if he enters the area, where each of his terrified victims lived, at any time in the next five years. Jailing him for two years after he admitted two attempted burglaries and one burglary, Judge Martin Rudland said he had 'deliberately targeted vulnerable women' scaling the walls of buildings 'like a cat burglar of old' in a series of 'highly suspicious offences'. Hall stole nothing from the victims. Making the order prohibiting Hall from 'the area known as the Northern Quarter', bordered by Shudehill, Church Street, Dale Street and Newton Street, Judge Martin Rudland said 'we need to protect the occupants of flats.' In the first offence, on June 16, a teenager, who has been left traumatised by her ordeal, spotted Hall hiding behind a clothes maiden on a balcony of a first floor flat at Silver Jubilee Walk, off Oak Street. When she asked him what he was doing, he sat up and 'appeared scared', telling her: 'Don't phone the police, you don't need to be scared of me. I'm just hiding.' He then lied that police were chasing him, the court heard. The victim led him to the front door but a short time later, having returned to her bedroom, saw him again on the balcony. Hall, of Farnborough Road, Miles Platting, has 45 offences on record for dishonesty, violence and breaches . She angrily approached him and he burst into tears, giving her a false name, before climbing down from the balcony. On June 28 a young woman at Vantage Quay, Brewer Street was watching TV at 3am when Hall climbed onto her ground floor balcony. In a ten minute ordeal he twice engaged her in conversation by banging on the window and claiming to have been chased. He told her a false name and repeatedly asked her, 'am I scaring you?', quizzed her about whether she lived alone, and told her she was 'dead sexy', before asking if he could come in.

Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league on Tuesday with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Castleford head coach Daryl Powell, the man who made Sinfield captain at the age of 22, trod the same path, although in a coaching capacity after losing the Rhinos top job in 2003, and has a word of warning for his former team-mate. 'It surprised me a little bit,' Powell said. 'It will be interesting to see if he can make a success of it but he's been an outstanding player and captain within the sport and you wouldn't back against him. I think he's been unbelievable in his career. 'He won't need my advice. He knows what he's doing. I'm sure he will have done all his homework. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . 'It's certainly a challenge. You look at Sam Burgess and what he's going through, and Iestyn Harris - it's tough. It's not an easy thing to do. 'The one thing you do have is a bit of a sign on you, on your head. You're a bit of a target. 'It's a completely different sport. It will be interesting to see what position he's going to play, but I wish him all the best.' Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . Sinfield, who has guided the Rhinos to six Super League titles, three World Club Challenges and the Challenge Cup in 2014 at the expense of Powell's Castleford, will be the second high-profile departure from Headingley at the end of the year following Jamie Peacock's appointment as Hull KR's new football manager. The former Golden Boot winner is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, but Powell believes his old club have a ready-made replacement in 20-year-old Liam Sutcliffe, who has deputised for an injured Sinfield in the last two matches. 'They've got some really good young players,' Powell said. 'Liam Sutcllife has slotted in there and seems to be doing a good job. He looks like a mature young player who can handle things pretty much the way Kevin did when he was a young fella. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . 'I was obviously at the back end of my career when Kevin started and it looked like he was going to be an outstanding player. But I don't think anyone could have foreseen how good he was going to be and how many things he would win and how much he would grow as a leader in the game. He's been awesome.' Sinfield has been named in Leeds' 19-man squad for Friday's derby at Castleford, but coach Brian McDermott will not rush his skipper back. 'I'm not sure if he's going to be fit for Friday,' McDermott said. 'What we have got to make sure when Kev does come back into the team is that he's 100 per cent fit. 'Sutcliffe's played really well in these last couple of games. He's held his own and in some parts of the games has played really well. 'It's good to know that while Kevin's in recovery, Sutty is doing a good job and getting more experience.'",

And then also, having a chance to win the last couple of week and not pulling it off.' He was runner-up in the Texas Open and lost in a playoff at the Houston Open before arriving at Augusta. The world's media were keen to get even more footage of the Augusta champion after his big weekend . It was the disappointment of last year that ultimately carried Spieth to victory and the legacy he craved . 'So the combination of the two allowed me to keep my head down, not worry about anyone else in the field except myself and to play a golf course that is my favorite course in the world,' he said. The par-5 eighth hole is where it all started to go wrong last year. He had a two-shot lead and made bogey to Watson's birdie. On the ninth hole, Spieth's shot came up a fraction short and tumbled down the front of the green and back into the fairway, leading to another bogey. Watson birdied and suddenly was two shots ahead, and Spieth didn't have the power or the putting to catch up. This year was different. His lead down to three shots, Spieth made a simple birdie on the eighth hole. This time, his approach on the ninth was fraction long enough to land on the ridge and stay put. He made par, and Justin Rose had a three-putt bogey to fall five shots behind. He was runner-up in the Texas Open and lost in a playoff at the Houston Open before arriving at Augusta . Bubba Watson presents Spieth  with the green jacket after his\u00a018-under total secured him the victory . There was only one shaky moment after that. Spieth was four shots ahead and looking at a two-shot swing on the 16th when Rose had 15 feet for birdie and Spieth faced an 8-foot putt for par. Rose missed. Spieth made. He was on his way. 'It was probably one of the best putts he hit all day,' Rose said. It's tempting to declare Spieth as golf's next big star after such a performance and the elite company he joins. In the last century, only four players have three PGA Tour titles that include a major before turning 22 - Spieth, Woods, Tom Creavy and Gene Sarazen. He was the first wire-to-wire winner at Augusta in 39 years. He already is No 2 in the world, and he still has work to do to reach Rory McIlroy at No 1. Justin Rose praised Spieth's put on the 16th that he missed to set him on his way as 'one of the best' Golf is craving a rivalry, and this has all the trappings of one, especially because the world ranking has never had No 1 and No 2 both 25 or younger. It's worth waiting to see if other young players emerge the rest of the year in the majors, such as Jason Day or even Hideki Matsuyama, who finished fifth. But that Friday at Augusta, when Spieth shot 66 and built a five-shot lead, felt a lot like Friday at Congressional when McIlroy began to bury the U.S. Open field in 2011. 'He's way more mature than I was at 21, and a hell of a golfer and a great person as well,' McIlroy said. Rory McIlroy is currently world No 1 and while Spieth is far behind at No 2, golf is craving a top rivalry . McIlroy was not ready to think about a rivalry, even though he stated his goal very clearly that he wants to be No 1. This was a big step, but it was only a step. 'He's got four majors,' Spieth said of McIlroy. 'That's something I can still only dream about.' If history is any indication, the kid is a quick study. And he seems to be in a hurry to get where he's going.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)On Tuesday, a white police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back. Officer Michael Slager was arrested after raw video surfaced showing him firing numerous shots at Walter Scott as Scott ran away from a traffic stop. The video footage contradicts Slager's statement that he felt threatened after Scott allegedly took his stun gun during a scuffle.  The Post and Courier reported that the FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the State Law Enforcement Division, while the South Carolina attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations. Now, after watching the footage \u2014 which should remain in your memory for a long time to come \u2014 one could say that Slager shot Scott like a dog.  But then again, dogs usually are not treated this badly.  But the man was shot like a runaway slave. In this case, there was clear documented evidence of what occurred, and no room for fabrications.  Most police fatal shootings do not result in indictments because prosecutors conclude they are justifiable.  The police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death, or like Slager, apparently place a Taser near Scott's body and concoct some story that his life was in danger. \"We can't bring Mr. Scott back, but something like this today can have a bigger precedence than just what happened here with Mr. Scott. Because what happened today doesn't happen all the time,\" said L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, at a press conference. \"I don't think that all police officers are bad cops, but there are some bad ones out there. And I don't want to see anyone get shot down the way that my brother got shot down,\" said Anthony Scott, brother of the victim. \"What if there was no video? What if there was no witness, or hero as I call him, to come forward?  Then this wouldn't have happened, because as you can see, the initial reports stated something totally different.  The officer said that Mr. Scott attacked him and pulled his Taser and tried to use it on him.  But somebody was watching,\" Stewart added. \"After watching the video, the senseless shooting and taking of #WalterScott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,\" tweeted Sen. Tim Scott.  \"My heart aches for the family and our North Charleston community. I will be watching this case closely.\" Although the black community and others have been aware for years of the problem of police brutality, through personal experience and anecdotes, the data confirm that police use of deadly force is a black and white issue. A ProPublica analysis of police shootings from 2010 to 2012 found that young black males are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than young white males.  And 67% of teens killed while fleeing or resisting arrest were black. Of the whites who are killed by cops, 91% are killed by white cops. Sixty-eight percent of people of color who are killed by police are also killed by white officers.  Furthermore, 10% of police involved in fatal shootings are black, and 78% of the people killed by black officers are black. According to Cynthia Lee of George Washington University Law School, the disproportionate representation of blacks and other people of color in police shootings is due to the role of racial stereotypes by police.  Racial stereotypes, Lee argues, subconsciously influence an officer's decision on whether to use deadly force, even if the police do not consciously decide to use deadly force based on race.  A simple question posed to the officer by a black person could be perceived as a threat to the officer's authority. What's more, a Washington State University study on deadly force found that participants felt more threatened in scenarios involving black suspects, suggesting participants \"held subconscious biases associating blacks and threats.\" Scott is the latest in a long line of black bodies, from Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, to John Crawford III near Dayton, Ohio, and Tanisha Anderson and Tamir Rice in Cleveland. In this case, the bystander video of Scott's killing and the cover-up of the crime by Slager made the difference.  Otherwise, the bogus narrative of the good white cop protecting himself from the menacing black thug may have prevailed. What happened in North Charleston tells us the epidemic of police deadly force has not died.  And yet, the mobilization and heightened consciousness of people across the nation have kept the issue on the front burner. The taking of black lives by the police remains a crisis situation in America that must be addressed, because #BlackLivesMatter. May Walter Scott rest in peace. The arrest and charging of Officer Michael Slager is a rare event that must be celebrated for the small victory that it is, in the midst of unspeakable tragedy.  But this is by no means over.",

Melbourne-based Jon Czerniecki positioned trail cameras to spot deer on his grandparents' farm near Wangaratta, northeast Victoria, over the Easter long weekend. When he checked the nine hours of footage, Mr Czerniecki stumbled upon the upsetting spectacle, which shows the canines ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back. Mr Czerniecki has since contacted the local council and Parks Victoria in hopes of notifying the owners of the dogs about what they had done, but he claims they're unwilling to help. The disturbing nine hour vision shows the two canines ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back . Mr Czerniecki told Daily Mail Australia he had never spotted anything like it in eight months of using the trail cameras. 'I've seen plenty of animals but never any dogs. It's clear the kangaroo had a broken leg, and the dogs were just torturing it for such a long span of time.' He said he has contacted Parks Victoria and the local council in hopes of tracking down the owners of the dogs. 'They weren't having a bar of it because it happened on a private property. I figure it can't be that hard to track down the owners in that area,' he said. 'I think they should be told what the dogs were up to, but it's clear the authorities aren't going to help.' Jon Czerniecki serendipitously captured the encounter after setting up trail cameras to spot deer on his grandparents' farm . Wildlife specialist Tim Faulkner said the kangaroo should have been able to escape the dogs and must have been 'suffering immensely' Wild dogs such as dingos are known to only attack kangaroos out of necessity, but the domestic origin of the dogs challenges this stereotype. Wildlife specialist Tim Faulkner from the Australian Reptile Park told 9 News he was disturbed by the video. 'I can't fathom that, he should be able to get away. No one likes to see animals suffer. We rationalise that by saying 'predators need to eat prey',' he said. 'What we're seeing there is immense suffering.'

But two long-time friends from Canada, who took their two sets of sons on a journey to the original home of Kentucky Fried Chicken in Corbin, Kentucky, said it's a trip they'll never forget. The group of six completed the drive in three days crossing two Canadian provinces including Quebec and Ontario, as well as five U.S. states - New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, according to The Times Tribune. For three of the sons, it was the first time they had tasted KFC. Two long-time friends and their four sons traveled from Montreal, Quebec to Corbin, Kentucky to eat at the original home of Kentucky Fried Chicken (above left to right: Jason Lutfy, Sebastien Lutfy, Neil Janna, Jesse Janna, Josh Janna and Brian Lutfy) Brian Lutfy, center, his son, Jason, left, and stepson Sebastien enjoy original Kentucky Fried Chicken at the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum in Corbin on Saturday . Brian Lufty, 52, one of the fathers who packed the four sons into a van, made the 34-hour round trip mission for his third time to visit the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum in Corbin. His tales of earlier visits to the KFC inspired the most recent trip. The group left from Montreal on Thursday and arrived at the restaurant on Saturday afternoon. 'Neil and I have been friends for 35 years, and doing ongoing, crazy things have been special for us. But to bring our sons here with us makes it even more fun,' Lufty told the Times Tribune. 'We do practical jokes with our kids. We've done skits that we taped along the way. It's been a crazy road trip. It's been at the top of our bucket list.' He continued: 'I did that first trip 30 years ago, and the second one 20 years ago. Now it's come full circle. We did fun things with our kids. The important thing about this trip is this \u2014 don't be afraid to have fun.' While there are KFC restaurants in the Montreal metropolitan area, known as Poulet Frit Kentucky, Lufty's son Jason suggested going on a father-son trip to Corbin to visit the KFC. This was after hearing his father's stories about his previous road trips there. On Saturday morning, Lufty, his sons Jason and Sebastien,  his friend Neil Janna, 51, and his two sons Jesse and Josh, made a stop to visit Colonel Sanders birth place in Henryville, Indiana. Traveling 2,090 miles, crossing over five U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, the group of six spent five days away from home while on the special trip. In total it took three days to drive from Montreal to Kentucky (a map of their journey above) They then traveled to his burial place and Yum! Brand's headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. That afternoon, they arrived at Sanders Cafe in their blue van featuring a bucket of Colonel's chicken on the roof while wearing their special-made shirts to commemorate the trip. The Canadians were met by the cafe's general manager Dennis Overbey who told them he couldn't recall during his 40 years working there of anyone traveling as far as 2,090 miles to eat at the restaurant. After they ordered their meal of two platters of KFC's original recipe and extra crispy, they sat down at a table pulling out the items they brought to make the meal a feast: plates, silverware, candles, artificial flowers and glasses. Janna's son, Jesse, who enjoyed the fried chicken for the first time said it was 'delicious.' 'It was a great trip. It was funny most of the time, and we anticipated coming here to eat,' Sebastien told the Times Tribune. 'We stopped at several places, and people participated in our shenanigans, like small skits we did our Facebook page for all our friends and family to see.' Jason said:\u00a0'I think it's crazy to do this trip, going all the way down from Canada to Corbin. And what a trip it was. It's my first time to have Kentucky Fried Chicken. I'd like to start this with my kids. It's going to be a tradition.' The group of six visited Colonel Harland Sanders grave (file photo above) in Louisville, Kentucky before arriving at the restaurant on Saturday afternoon .",

Welcome, then, to Nu York, a city that bears no resemblance to the version depicted in Friends and Gossip Girl and instead centres around a throbbing contemporary arts scene largely based in Brooklyn and Queens - the latter the beneficiary of a recent gentrification programme. Gone (mostly) are the rough tenements and in their place, a bustling network of shop-lined streets and some seriously classy bars and hotels. Among the latter was the Z Hotel, a stark block of a building decked out in the industrial-chic style so beloved of London hipsters. Stateside Shoreditch, as it were. It was all a far cry from Iceland where I had begun my trip, courtesy of an Icelandair wheeze that gives you the option of stopping off to see the sights of Reykjavik and the spectacular Golden Circle for up to seven days en route to Boston, Anchorage, Washington or, in my case, New York. Although still on the global naughty step thanks to a calamitous economic meltdown in 2009, the Icelandic capital shows signs of recovery \u2013 not least in the form of the revellers that lined the street outside the Apotek Hotel, a gloriously Scandinavian-looking place to stay, as I arrived at midnight following an evening flight from London. The next morning, I dragged myself out of bed for a Viking-style cooking class at Salt Eldhus where I learned to cook barley risotto and salt and pepper salmon \u2013 the perfect way, as it turned out, to fortify me for the dramatic scenery that came next. Stunning: The Gullfoss Waterfall in Pingvellir National Park is a short hop from Reykjavik . Awe-inspiring: Geysir is home to a row of geysers that fire boiling water and a sulphurous stench into the air . Covered with a thick layer of snow, Pingvellir National Park sits atop the fault line that separates the American continent from the European one and provides Iceland with its volcanoes, geysers and geothermal springs. The site of Iceland\u2019s first parliament, it\u2019s a short hop from Geysir, where a series of geysers explode in a shower of boiling water and revolting sulphurous stench every five minutes or so. Slipping and sliding on the ice, the first explosion caught me unawares and forced me to jump back. At the next one, I held my nerve, looking smugly round at the tourists who had been caught on the hop like I had been. Then came a trip to Fri\u00f0heimar, a series of greenhouses filled with tomato plants and set next to a stable crammed with hairy Icelandic ponies. The glowing buildings were an odd sight, although the produce was second to none, but even that paled in comparison to the Secret Spring \u2013 a bubbling pool flanked by a geyser and lit, on clear nights, by the shimmering green and purple glow of the Northern Lights. Sitting there, watching them ripple, was truly magical. The next morning, it was off to New York which, with its claustrophobic cluster of skyscrapers and determinedly chic inhabitants, was a very different prospect indeed. While Iceland, like the rest of Scandinavia, boasts an effortless flair for design and a natural cool, the Big Apple has clearly worked on it. Beneath the too-cool-for-school surface, however, lies some old-fashioned Americana \u2013 not least in the all-American charm of the cheerful locals. Looking cool: Williamsburg, home to Jake Gyllenhaal among others, is awash with artisan bars . New look: Queens has had a makeover, with tough neighbourhoods replaced with cool shops and chic bars . Among them are the staff at the Roger Smith Hotel in Manhattan, who took a break from watching the Super Bowl to ply me with burgers and fries as I arrived, dishevelled, following a five-hour flight from Reykjavik. The next morning, after an all-American breakfast of bacon and waffles, I left the chintzy charms of the Roger Smith behind for a visit to MOMA, the epicentre of New York\u2019s cultural cool. A fabulous place set in a glass and steel building over several floors, it is crammed with modern art dating from the mid-18th century onwards. Matisse, Monet and Picasso are there in numbers, as are Frieda Kahlo and Andy Warhol. Rothko, Malevich and Seurat dot its walls, as does some appalling stuff by the likes of Jean-Pierre Basquiat \u2013 avoid that and stick to the good bits on the third floor is my advice. Carrying bags of Warhol prints and a Sunday morning sized MOMA mug, we hopped into one of New York\u2019s iconic yellow taxis for a short ride to low-rise Williamsburg, where another hipster favourite \u2013 craft beer \u2013 is taking hold. Beneath the pub where we ate lunch was a small collection of stills, where a variety of types, including one containing raw oysters, was being brewed. It was all delicious and a pleasant change from the Budweiser usually found in American bars. Artisan beer, artisan food and artisan art are all staples of New York\u2019s burgeoning hipster culture, although to a cynical Brit like me, some of it felt a little try-hard. Brilliant: The Museum of Moving Image is set to become a New York must-visit - well worth going to . A case in point is the play Sleep No More, which made its d\u00e9but in London to critical rumblings and indifferent audiences but has become a real favourite in New York. Set in a warehouse over several floors, the idea is that you walk in at an unspecified point in the play (I managed to work out that it was a version of Macbeth but not everyone does) and follow the actors around attempting to get a handle on the action. Beginning in a wonderfully old-fashioned red-velvet lined bar, the action was compered by a chap with a British accent taken from the Dick van Dyke school of acting, who showed us into a lift and provided us with Scream-style masks before throwing us into the thick of things. Moving around the huge set, I walked into scene after scene and never really got much sense of the plot, although I did find myself becoming increasingly irritated with the hammy miming. Indeed, so disjointed was Sleep No More,   $20 booklets explaining the plot were being flogged to theatregoers, who had already paid $80 to get in, on their way out. Being unable to work out what it was all about is clearly a recurrent problem. Luckily for those whose tastes don\u2019t stretch to baffling plays and bottles of dog fluff, New York still has much to love. Along with MOMA, there\u2019s the brilliant Museum of Moving Image in Queens which takes you on a whistlestop tour through the US\u2019 lengthy cinematic history with the help of a cleverly curated selection of pieces, among them the creepy doll which found fame in the Exorcist. Then there\u2019s the bewildering selection of places to eat. In Queens alone, there\u2019s everything from Brazilian to British and everything in between - and nearly all of it is delicious. And of course, there are all those iconic sights: the slow-moving Hudson River, the Rockerfeller Center, the Statue of Liberty and more. Nu York might not be to everyone\u2019s taste but there\u2019s no shortage of reasons to love the Big Apple \u2013 pulsating art scene and a quirky taste in plays included. Just don't make me watch Sleep No More again. Icelandair (icelandair.co.uk) flies from five UK airports including Birmingham to 14 North American destinations.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nGorkha, Nepal (CNN)The ride from Kathmandu to near the epicenter of Nepal's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick. Steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where Nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured, in much less than ideal circumstances. The view along the six-hour journey from the capital is deceptive. Although I see numerous landslides, I am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected. During the entire journey, I notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses. One of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in Nepal is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas. One of them is Gorkha, a district northwest of Kathmandu. The town we were visiting looks intact. Some houses have cracks, and I see a few collapsed brick walls. Most of the shops and businesses are open. But our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe. The hospital campus is overflowing with patients. The facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity. The injured are not from the town of Gorkha, which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges. They are from northern part of the district, where some 200,000 people live. To accommodate all the casualties, the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot. At a time of our arrival, there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor. The youngest is 10, the oldest in his 70s. Most of them have visible wounds: deep cuts, bruised faces, broken arms and legs or spinal injuries. All of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering. Mita Gurung, 10, sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of Sinjung partially collapsed. Her mother was injured in the tremor. Mita is gently tended by volunteer child counselor Tara May Bishakarma. \"I just found what she likes and keep repeating it. Her injuries are fairly superficial, but she is traumatized. It will take some time, but she will recover,\" Bishakarma says. Children usually get excited when being filmed. Mita seems almost unaware of my camera. Little food, less optimism in Kathmandu tent city . The situation in the hospital's emergency room is similar. Every bed is taken. All the injured are taken care of by attentive doctors and nurses. Some have family members with them. Despite the gravity of the situation, the atmosphere here is calm. Gorkha's hospital is ill-equipped to treat more serious injuries and serves mostly as a transit point. Here, the injured get necessary first aid and as soon as possible are transferred to bigger hospitals in other districts or in Kathmandu. There are not enough ambulances, and most of the injured must travel on old buses. People unable to walk are transported on makeshift wooden stretchers. I cannot even imagine traveling on the road we just came in with a broken leg or a spinal injury. The caws of crows above Gorkha are frequently interrupted by sounds of helicopters. We leave the hospital and go to check the landing zones. One is a sports field, and the second a flat meadow on the ridge. Many of the damaged villages are not accessible by roads. To fly to most remote places from Gorkha takes about 30 minutes, five days on foot. The helicopters operated by Nepalese military bring tents, tarps, blankets, food and baby supplies to most damaged areas. They bring back the injured. One helicopter brings  two stranded Danish tourists from Chumchet, a village in the Tsum Valley. They are in a group of 11 trekkers from Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic who remain in the valley. Most of the helicopters are small and can only pick up two to three passengers. We head back to the hospital, where we meet Olivier Hagon. He is the head of a mission of the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit, a Swiss government agency. The agency's \"Mother and Child\" team helps the needy during disasters around the world. \"For us, it's most important to focus on the most vulnerable ones: mothers and children. Women in labor who do not have a bed, women in need of a cesarean (section) without access to surgery facilities,\" says Hagon. The rest of the 10-member unit arrives from Kathmandu in the evening. The team includes a pediatrician, a pediatric surgeon, an orthopedic surgeon, a midwife, an anesthesiologist and a gynecologist. Within two hours, they set up two modern fully functioning operating theaters at the hospital. The group's philosophy is \"to support, not to invade.\" They work very closely with staff of Gorkha's hospital. The Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit is followed by 26 members of the International Search and Rescue Germany. They bring seven search dogs. Leader Thomas Laackmann explains: \"Right now we focus on finding survivors. The chances are diminishing every hour. Members of our team are trained medics. We will also assist with treating the injured.\" All aid workers sleep in tents on hospital premises. On Thursday, we wake up to a drizzly morning. Heavy fog blankets surrounding slopes and mountains. All helicopter flights are suspended. People in remote areas desperately awaiting help won't get any today. But here in Gorkha, humanitarian teams are at full speed. Swiss doctors along with their Nepalese colleagues perform surgeries. The German team heads off in a bus to villages reachable by road. We wish our hosts in Gorkha the best of luck and leave for Kathmandu mid-afternoon. I had come to see how serious the situation is and how local and state authorities are coping. I am too overwhelmed and too exhausted to draw any conclusions. But I learned a lot about resilience of the Nepalese and about good people from around the world committed to help them. Much help will be needed.",

The Australian airline could also be facing a massive \u00a320,000 fine, that's more than AU$38,000, for every time the A380 flights set down more than fifteen late on the English tarmac. Delayed: Qantas have been \u00a0told they could loose thier eight Heathrow landing strips after continuously arriving late to the busy airport . Fairfax published an internal a memo sent by Captain Martin Gardiner, manager of base operations at Sydney, that details the airlines failings while insisting can staff improve their waning performance. 'As a result of our performance, London airport has given Qantas an official warning; meaning that we could be fined \u00a320,000 [$AU38,336] for each non-compliance of our slot time, or worse lose our slot.' 'We have been asked to advise Heathrow what our plans are to improve this performance. All areas of the business including flight operations are now monitoring the performance of these services very closely so that we can improve our performance and retain our landing slots in [London].' Qantas have slipped to an on time ranking of 75 out of 80 airlines that use Heathrow airport . While Qantas' on time performance rating at Heathrow dropped to 75th out of 80 in the month of February, they are at serious risk of losing their landing spots at Heathrow before next flying season. Captain Gardiner reportedly said changes in flight times in the last 12 months had 'placed some additional stress on our network and turn-around times'. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that there are a number of factors that can impact our arrival time into London and because of the way scheduling works, small delays on a long journey have a cumulative knock on affect. 'One of the biggest impacts is air traffic delays to get into Heathrow, which is a particular issue because we arrive at one of the most popular times and the airport is now at about 100 per cent capacity.' He said Qantas will be trying to increase the speed of A380 flights to ensure they make it to Heathrow in time. A Qantas spokesperson said air congestion at Heathrow and Dubai were to blame for the late arrivals .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nHector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations. 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.",

The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. \"We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,\" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally \"possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have.\" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd? CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.",

The Al Qaeda-linked networks have altered their tactics since the fugitive stole intelligence files from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, according to a report. Extremist websites have also moved to protect their digital communications by releasing encryption programmes for followers, making it harder for extremists to be tracked down. Scroll down for video . Last Week Tonight host John Oliver flew to Moscow to grill Edward Snowden about the leaking of 'harmful' documents and asks him to explain why he did it . Evidence of the harm done to intelligence agencies across the world after the former CIA contractor leaked 1.7million classified documents in 2013 is compiled in the first comprehensive public analysis of the leaks by the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank. The Snowden files revealed details about covert attempts by agencies to view citizens' private information by gathering internet histories, emails, text and call records and passwords. Now the Henry Jackson Society has found that at least three Al Qaeda affiliates are known to have altered their communications. The think-tank has also found other groups using human couriers instead of email and mobile phones. Snowden\u00a0fled justice in the US to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location . Jihadist websites also released three 'significant' encryption programmes 'within a three- to five-month time frame of the leaks', meaning fanatics are harder to detect and encrypted emails take longer to decipher. Report author Robin Simcox said: 'The focus has been about the so-called mass surveillance by GCHQ and the NSA but these leaks have allowed extremist groups and jihadists to look at our capabilities \u2013 what we can and can't do \u2013 which has given them a great insight. 'At a time when the range of threats against the West has never been greater, with Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Al Qaeda in Pakistan, it is astonishing the focus has been more on the shortcomings of our intelligence agencies and not the fact Snowden has helped terror suspects drop off the radar. 'He has caused severe damage to our ability to fight extremism.' MI5 director general Andrew Parker has called the traitor's actions a 'gift to terrorists'. On Monday, Snowden revealed he had not read all the top-secret dossiers he stole before handing them to newspapers including the Guardian \u2013 a move which has put lives in jeopardy from terrorists. He claims he had to act because the US and other Western governments' policies were a 'threat to democracy'. He fled justice in the US to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location.",

A Houston Uber driver arrested and charged last week with sexually assaulting a female passenger was granted approval to drive for the car service despite being a convicted cocaine dealer. Duncan Burton, 57, was released in November 2012 after 14-years behind bars but was allowed to work for Uber despite city controls prohibiting drug felons driving cabs. Burton was taken into custody on Wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years. Uber spokeswoman, Debbee Hancock said on Monday that Burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name. However, according to Uber's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago. That means because Burton was sentence 14-years ago, his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag. Indeed, Burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the US Bureau of Prisons. That information is readily available online by typing in his name. He was convicted in Houston and served time in Louisana and Georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior. According to Houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs. However, they could appeal and still receive one. Burton did not have a city permit to drive a cab and had never applied for an exemption. Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. Last week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks.",

Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with his Thai girlfriend moments before his death. He is also understood to have clashed with a man who was seen talking to his girlfriend at a bar. The incidents happened in Hua Hin, a coastal town and beach resort 120 miles south-west of Bangkok. Tragic: Iain Mackay, 40, (pictured) is understood to have got into a fight at the Hua Hin resort, 125 miles south of Bangkok, after discovering the woman chatting with another man at a bar in the coastal city . Thai police said Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a shop near to the bar where he had spotted his girlfriend. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed. However, friends of Mr Mackay claim that he had clashed with another man who had been talking to his girlfriend moments before his death, the Press and Journal newspaper reported. Others said that Mr Mackay had posted links to his girlfriend\u2019s Facebook page before his death in which she was pictured with another man. One friend said: \u2018Iain was obviously upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.\u2019 Those close to Mr Mackay said he had been in a relationship with his girlfriend for several years. Mr Mackay, an underwater research specialist, is believed to have been employed by seismic research company Polarcus, which is based in Dubai. Location: The resort where Mr Mackay died is in Hua Hin (pictured) - a coastal city 125 miles south of Bangkok . Sources at the company confirmed that Mr Mackay was on leave from his vessel and had told colleagues that he planned to spend his time off in Thailand. Thai officials said that Mr Mackay had died at 3pm on Saturday but relatives claim that they were told of his death on Friday. The Foreign Office also confirmed that Mr Mackay had died on Friday. A spokesman said: \u2018We can confirm the death of a British national in Hua Hin, Thailand, on April 3. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.\u2019 Mr Mackay\u2019s death comes nine years after a British former public schoolboy was murdered after splitting with his Thai wife at the Hua Hin resort. Toby Charnaud, 41, was beaten to death with an iron bar and wooden staves by relatives of his ex-wife, Pannada Laoruang, in August 2006. Laoruang then helped them burn his body before chopping it up and scattering the remains. A Thai court at the time heard how Mr Charnaud, who was educated at Marlborough College, sold \u00a32.5million Latimer Manor estate near Chippenham, Wiltshire, after falling in love with 35-year-old Laoruang, whom he met in a Bangkok bar while on holiday. Last year British students Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao. Two Burmese men have been charged with their murder.

The former U.S. Army General, whose career was destroyed when the affair with Paula Broadwell emerged in November 2012, avoided jail time at the hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday\u00a0and was instead sentenced to two years probation. He was also fined $100,000 - more than double the $40,000 his attorneys had requested. While Petraeus had agreed two months ago to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, he formally entered his plea during Thursday's hearing. Petraeus was wearing his wedding ring but there was no sign of his wife, Holly. He told the court he wanted to apologize to those closest to him 'for the pain my actions caused'. Apologies: Former CIA director David Petraeus apologized for his 'mistakes' as he spoke outside the North Carolina courthouse where he was sentenced to two years probation on Thursday afternoon . Sentenced: As well as the probation, he was fined $100,000 for leaking classified information to his mistress . Following the hearing, he briefly addressed the media outside the courthouse. 'As I did in the past, I apologize for those closest to me and many others,' he said, before thanking his supporters including his family, colleagues and fellow veterans. 'I now look forward to moving on with the next phase of my life and with continuing to serve our great nation as a private citizen,' he added. Critics have noted that in other cases concerning government leaks, defendants have received far harsher punishments than Petraeus. CIA analyst John Kiriakou who is serving 30 months behind bars for revealing the secret CIA torture program. Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represents Edward Snowden, told Reuters that he was not against lighter sentences - as long as such treatment is handed out equally. 'The problem is not that David Petraeus is getting lenient treatment,' Wizner said. 'The problem is that lenient treatment is only available to people in high places.' Petraeus was also given special conditions for his probation. He is allowed to travel internationally with his probation officer's approval, for example, and is allowed to possess firearms. He is allowed to pay the $100,000 fine $25,000 per month until it is paid in full. Going solo: Petraeus, who was seen wearing his wedding ring to  court, was not accompanied by his wife Holly to the sentencing hearing. It emerged in 2012 that he had been having an affair with his biographer . Petraeus has 14 days to file an appeal if he wants to dispute the sentencing. In the previous agreement, prosecutors said that while Broadwell was writing her book in 2011, Petraeus gave her eight binders of classified material he had improperly kept from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Days later, he took the binders back to his house. Among the secret information contained in the 'black books' were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus' discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors said. Those binders were later seized by the FBI in an April 2013 search of Petraeus' Arlington, Virginia, home, where he had kept them in the unlocked drawer of a desk in a ground-floor study. Prosecutors said that after resigning from the CIA in November 2012, Petraeus had signed a form falsely attesting he had no classified material. He also lied to FBI agents by denying he supplied the information to Broadwell, according to court documents. Affair: Petraeus gave his mistress Paula Broadwell, pictured together in 2011, classified material that he had improperly kept from his time in the military. She was writing his biography at the time . Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down, while in May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the relationship. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus\u00a0held the CIA post less than a year, not long enough to leave a significant mark on the spy agency. The core of his identity has been a military man. He was brought in by President George W. Bush to command multinational forces in Iraq in 2007, a period when the war began to turn in favor of the U.S. Petraeus' command coincided with the 'surge' of American forces in Iraq and a plan to pay Sunni militias to fight al-Qaeda in Iraq. With American help, the Sunni tribes were able to push out insurgents and enable U.S. troops to withdraw in 2011. Those same Sunni areas are now controlled by the Islamic State group, which evolved from the remnants of al-Qaida after Iraqi's Shiite-led government proved weak.",

A million people will be able to realise the dream of home ownership by 2020, David Cameron claimed today as he donned hi-vis to tour a building site. The Prime Minister said seven key Tory policies would help get people on to the property ladder by building more homes and cutting the cost of saving for a deposit, moving house and paying off mortgages. The Tory leader, wearing notably clean new work boots, as he chatted to house builders, insisted 'dream of home ownership is alive'. Mr Cameron used the launch of the Conservative party manifesto yesterday to promise voters 'security at every stage of your life'. He said the 'greatest sunshine that there can possibly be' included helping more people but their own home, as well as getting a job and having dignity in retirement. Today the Tory leader set out a seven point plan which he claims will help build more houses and making it easier for first-time buyers, claiming it will help a million people become homeowners over the next parliament. Mr Cameron said: 'The Conservative Party is the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your lives. 'At the heart of that is helping people onto the housing ladder. It comes back to our values. We believe if you work hard, save up, and do the right thing, you should be able to buy your own place. 'The plans in our manifesto will open home ownership to a million more people. With us, the dream of home ownership is alive. 'And it's why we can look the working people of Britain in the eye and say we are with you. That's why we are setting out a seven point plan to help build more houses, and help more people get a home of their own.' The seven point plan includes the Help to Buy ISA, announced by George Osborne in last month's Budget, which will help first-time buyers save for a deposit. For every \u00a3200 someone puts towards a deposit, the government will add \u00a350 up to a maximum of \u00a312,000, meaning a bonus of up to \u00a33,000. Savers will be able to earn hundreds of pounds in interest before paying tax. The Tories say it is effectively a tax cut for first time buyers, and will be available from this autumn. The second policy is a pledge to will build 200,000 starter homes which will be sold at a 20 per cent discount on the market value to first time buyers under the age of 40. Thirdly, the Help to Buy: Equity Loan scheme has been extended to 2020. For first-time buyers who have saved a 5 per cent deposit, the government will offer a loan of 20 per cent, with the remaining 75 per cent covered by a mortgage. The Tories expect the extension to help people buy at least 100,000 new build homes over the next five years. The Tory leader, visiting the Weston Homes Aura building site, Edgware,\u00a0boasted that with him in charge,\u00a0the 'dream of home ownership is alive' The fourth policy is the funding of 75,000 shared ownership homes by 2020 and the fifth is the abolition of the hated slab system of stamp duty, so it rises steadily based on the value of the home. It means stamp duty has been cut for 98 per cent of the people who pay it. For example, someone buying a house costing \u00a3275,000, would pay \u00a34,500 less in tax. Mr Cameron announced the two final policies in his speech yesterday. It includes a new \u00a31 billion Brownfield Regeneration Fund, to help councils clear derelict or contaminated land which can be used to build 400,000 extra homes over four years. He also announced a massive extension in the Right to Buy scheme to 1.3million housing association tenants. The existing Right to Buy allows tenants living in council-owned properties local authority tenants to buy houses and flats at a discount of as much as 70 per cent up to a maximum of \u00a3102,700 in London and \u00a377,000 across the rest of England. Mr Cameron\u00a0announced a massive extension in the Right to Buy scheme to 1.3million housing association tenants . The Conservatives plan would extend the scheme to people living in properties owned by housing associations - not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes. Around 500,000 housing association tenants currently have no purchase rights and 800,000 who qualify only for much less generous discounts of \u00a316,000 or less. Local councils will be required to sell off their most expensive properties as they become vacant, in order to raise an estimated \u00a34.5 billion a year to fund the scheme. Some 15,000 houses and flats are expected to become available in this way each year, but Tories stressed that no-one will be forced out of their home.",

But a deep feeling of a big friend, that doesn't change.' Mourinho said his players needed no motivation this week as they prepare to face United in what is always a 'special fixture.' He said games such as Saturday night's showdown at Stamford Bridge make his job 'easy' because 'every player is desperate to play and focused.' He said: 'To play Manchester United is to play one of the biggest clubs in the world and one of the best in the Premier League and this is what everybody wants. 'I am not worried this week about motivating players because there is no need. [It is an] easy job. It is a special fixture, it is a big match.

He is a very correct boy and a top professional.' Chelsea can move 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal - who take on Reading in the FA cup semi-final at the same time - with three points against United. They are boosted by the likely return of striker Loic Remy from a calf injury and Mourinho also confirmed that 19-goal frontman Diego Costa will return to full training next week after making a quick recovery from a hamstring problem. This puts the Spain international in contention for next weekend's top-of-the-table clash with Arsenal at the Emirates. Costa injured his hamstring in the win over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on April 4 . Mourinho hinted that Loic Remy should return from a calf injury against Manchester United . Mourinho said on Costa: 'He is progressing very well. He has a chance for next weekend. Our target was for Diego to play our last four matches and Arsenal is the sixth from the end, so if he doesn't play it's not a problem but things are going so well he has a chance. 'He's training and he starts with the rest of the squad next week.' Mourinho wasn't willing to comment on figures revealed on Friday that show Chelsea have the worst behaviour towards referees in the Premier League. \u070e .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nGiant glaciers of ice may be lurking all over Mars, hidden from view by dust on the surface. That\u2019s the surprising conclusion of a study that found that large amounts of ice were not just at the Martian poles, but likely towards the equator as well. It means that, if all ice were to be spread across the surface of Mars, the entire planet would be covered in more than 3.3ft (one metre). This image from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows that a thick layer of dust on Mars covers the glaciers, so they appear as the surface of the ground, but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust . The latest research was carried out by scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June 2013, Curiosity found powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. Images from several Martian satellites had revealed the shape of glaciers just below the surface, and confirmed most were made of water-ice. And now the researchers have measured how big the glaciers are, and their similarity to glaciers on Earth. In total there is more than 150 billion cubic metres of ice on Mars, which could \u2018cover the entire surface of Mars with 1.1 metres of ice,\u2019 explained Dr Nanna Bj\u00f8rnholt Karlsson at the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute. She added that the ice closer to the Martian equator was \u2018an important part of Mars\u2019 water reservoir.\u2019 There are thought to be thousands of glacier-like formations on the planet in both the northern and southern hemispheres. They are located on Mars between latitude 30.0 and 50.0 - equivalent to just south of Denmark\u2019s location on Earth. Mars has belts of glaciers at its central latitudes - between the blue lines, in both the southern and northern hemispheres. A thick layer of dust covers the glaciers, so they appear as the surface of the ground, but radar measurements show that there are glaciers composed of frozen water underneath the dust . Using radar measurements (shown) from Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, researchers have been able to identify thousands of glacier-like formations on Mars. They can see how thick the ice is on the radar images . As the ice has not evaporated into space, the dust must be protecting it. If the ice were unprotected, it would evaporate and become water vapour, owing to the low atmospheric pressure on Mars. \u2018We have looked at radar measurements spanning ten years back in time to see how thick the ice is and how it behaves,\u2019 Dr Nanna Bj\u00f8rnholt Karlsson explained. \u2018A glacier is after all a big chunk of ice and it flows and gets a form that tells us something about how soft it is. \u2018We then compared this with how glaciers on Earth behave and from that we have been able to make models for the ice flow.\u2019 The latest research was carried out by scientists at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. They looked at how big the glaciers were, and also how similar they were to glaciers on Earth (one in Alaska shown) Nasa\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, artist's illustration shown, launched on 12 August 2005. It entered Martian orbit on 10 March 2006, and continues to remain operational today. It is tasked with imaging the surface, and also monitors weather and surface conditions on Mars .",

The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Niguel, California, was last seen in September 2011 when she arrived in Panama with Brimager. Her family reported her missing the following January . The indictment alleges that Brimager murdered Baldelli, dismembered her body and disposed of her body parts in a remote jungle area. Brimager then engaged in an elaborate scheme to cover up the crime, including destroying evidence and sending a series of emails purportedly from Baldelli in order to make it appear to her friends and family that she was still alive, according to court papers. The indictment also alleges that Brimager attempted to conceal his crime by disposing of a bloody mattress involved in Badelli's murder in the ocean. Brimager conducted two Internet searches on Baldelli's computer, one for 'washing mattress' and a second for 'washing mattress blood stain,' according to documents. A man who was cutting bushes on the island province of Bocas del Toro found a bag containing Baldelli's remains in August 2013. Baldelli's family has the clothing designer was frequently out of touch so they did not immediately suspect anything was wrong.

This comes only days after she sported her mom dance moves on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon during a segment called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2. On Monday, another highlight of the day's festivities was Mr Obama's annual reading of his favorite childhood book Where the Wild Things Are, which he has done since 2009. However, this year there was a disturbance when bees started buzzing near the children gathered for story-time on the South Lawn. Not breaking character, Mr\u00a0Obama settled the shrieking children by saying: 'If you're a wild thing, you can't be scared of bees!' Moves: The First Lady busts out her best dance moves to join the So You Think You Can Dance All Stars on stage at the Easter Egg Roll . Style: The First Lady took the spotlight during the performance as she added her own flair to the choreographed routine . Uptown Funk: Mrs Obama displays her moves during the routine, only days after she joined Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show where she danced in a segment called the Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2 . GimmeFive: The theme of this year's Easter Egg Roll is 'GimmeFive' which is part of the First Lady's campaign to get people to be more active . This year's theme is #GimmeFive, which is part of Mrs. Obama's campaign to try to get young people to be more active and lead healthier lives. However, President Obama did confess to having a bit of not-so-healthy Easter chocolate when asked by a reporter at the event. 'I had a few, I have to admit,' Mr Obama said. Notably not in attendance were first daughters Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, Obama. The president said they were occupied by 'a little school stuff going on'. Grrrrr: President Obama reads from the children's classic Where the Wild Things Are during Monday's Easter egg roll on the White House South Lawn . 'Let the wild rumpus start!': Each year, the president reads the book which was a childhood favorite . Be brave: At one point, bees were bothering some of the children gathered to hear the president read, and he refused to break character, saying 'If you're a wild thing, you can't be scared of bees! What a crowd: An estimated 35,000 came to the White House South Lawn Monday for the annual Easter egg roll . Celebrating spring: Above, the scene on the White House's South Lawn Monday morning as the Easter egg roll kicked off . Monday's events included sports and fitness zones, cooking demonstrations, and of course, the traditional egg roll in which kids compete to move their egg to the finish line first using only a wooden spoon. Staying true to the roll's theme, the president kept active during the event, playing tennis with Danish racket star Caroline Wozniacki and basketball with members of the Washington Wizards. Despite all the pick-up games he stages on the South Lawn courts, Mr Obama appears not to have improved his game much since he was hit in the head while shooting hoops Monday.

Getting the party started: Mrs Obama (center) checks out the crowd of 35,000 as her husband and the Easter Bunny wave . White House tradition: The president looks anxious to get the roll started on Monday, standing next to the Easter Bunny . Bo and Sunny along for the fun: The President and Mrs Obama walk down to the south Lawn with the family dogs Bo and Sunny for the Easter fun . Bunny-in-chief: The Easter Bunny photobombs a serious President Obama in this shot from Monday's Easter egg roll . According to a USA Today reporter, 'a ball very lightly hit POTUS in the face when he was standing under the basket catching rebounds, and Wizards' Paul Pierce seemed to apologize for that.' A Malayan flying fox named Kamilah, was also brought in to teach the children about bats and their ecosystems. For this year's celebrations, the White House collaborated with Snapchat and asked attendees to send out pictures on the social media app so that people around the world can follow along. It's a race! President Obama and the first lady watch as young boys and girls participate in the Easter egg roll . And they're off! Mr Obama blows a whistle to signal the start of the Easter egg roll where children compete to move an egg down a course the fastest using only a wooden spoon . The egg roll is one of the longest-standing White House traditions. In 1878, a sympathetic President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling when lawmakers passed a law banning the game from Capitol grounds. The Easter egg roll is free and tickets are distributed via a lottery to families with children 12 and under.

Easter tunes: The members of the girl group Fifth Harmony serenade the crowd from the White House on Monday . However, one of the children in attendance Monday was invited by President Obama himself. A 9-year-old girl named Sofia, from Massachusetts, made headlines last year when she sent a letter to the president, asking him why there weren't any women on U.S. currency. The president responded to the adorable letter and told little Sofia she had a great idea and had come up with a list of outstanding women. Each president has put his own spin on the event, such as President Jimmy Carter who added a petting zoo in 1977. Dressed to the nines: A little girl in her best Easter wear rolls a blue egg with a wooden spoon at Monday's festivities . Taking part in the tradition: The Easter egg roll is one of the White House's long-standing traditions, dating back to President Rutherford B Hayes' administration in 1878 . Competitive: The theme of this year's event was Let's Move, so it was only appropriate that the president break a sweat with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki . Sportsmanship: Wozniacki and the president exchange a friendly high five after their game of tennis on Monday . Strong backhand: The president stuck to the baseline and kept his eye on the ball during the rally .

The 43-year-old entrepreneur bought the three-bedroom property in the Park Circus area of Glasgow for \u00a3780,700 after she split from her former husband Michael in December 2011. She spent months renovating the period two-storey townhouse, described by estate agents as an 'outstanding interior designed luxury home' \u00a0which has been 'impeccably refurbished'. Scroll down for video . On the market: Michelle Mone has put her luxury Glasgow townhouse up for sale so she can buy her husband out of their 'dream' mansion . Luxury: The \u00a31million property in the exclusive area of the city comes complete with ornate high ceilings and large windows in the living room . Trendy: The fully-integrated kitchen has been fitted with modern, top of the range appliances and features a white gloss central island . Tycoon: Michelle Mone set up Ultimo underwear business with her husband Michael (right) in 1996, but they split in December 2011 . It features a grand staircase and magnificent reception hall leading to a modern fully integrated kitchen and drawing room complete with a marble fireplace and a living flame fire. The views expand over the residents central gardens in the exclusive part of the city and the master suite comes with it's own wet room. Each of the three high-ceilings bedrooms have been kitted out with lavish headboards, sparkling chandeliers and luxurious curtains. Interior photographs show the living room with a baby grand piano in it and a painting of a sleeping blonde woman above the fireplace. Grand: Ms Mone didn't move into the townhouse straightaway after spending months having it renovated, including this spectacular staircase . Magnificent: The large hallway leads to the staircase in the two-storey property, which comes complete with three bedrooms . Impressive: Ms Mone bought the property for \u00a3780,000 after splitting from her then husband. The large hallway comes with a massive mirror . It is being marketed by estate agents Corum for offers over \u00a3875,000, which means the Ultimo founder will profit from at least \u00a3100,00 if it sells. Once the sale is completed she plans to move back into her family home, a five-bedroom mansion in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire, after agreeing a deal with her ex-husband to buy it . Mone, who also owns a \u00a32million flat in Mayfair, London, said she would change her old mansion to rid it of 'bad memories' when she revealed her property plans last week. The mother-of-three said: 'I'm selling my home here in Glasgow but I also own the big house with my ex-husband. For two years I've been trying to buy him out of it and he only agreed just the other day - which is fantastic. 'I'm over the moon. I'll always have a base here in Glasgow but I've moved in to my London home as well. So, that means I'll have just the one home here rather than one and a half.' She said that although she has not lived in the Thorntonhall home for two years, she 'loves' the property, which she bought with her then husband, Mr Mone, in 2008. They demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a home six times the size of the average British house. Comfy: The bay windows stream light into the living room of the property, in an exclusive area of Glasgow, which has been fully re-decorated . Elegant: One of the bedrooms in the property has been decorated with a cerise and beige velvet accessories and features a large window seat . Sparkling: The master suite includes a wet room, kitted out in a gold-theme, while the house also has another shower room and laundry room . 'I designed it, I built it, I love it,' she said. 'But I'm going to change it all so that it doesn't have any of the bad memories from when I lived there. That said, I haven't been spending a whole lot of time in the town house since I've been promoting my book in America.' In 2010, Ms Mone was at the centre of a row with neighbours over plans to add a sauna, gym and bar to the home. Five residents objected to her proposals and one said the development would 'completely dwarf' the rest of the street. But it was still given the go-ahead by planners. The couple created lingerie brand Ultimo together in 1996, split in 2011 after she believed Michael had had an affair with bra designer, Samantha Bunn, with whom he has set up a rival lingerie firm. Writing on Twitter earlier this month, Ms Mone said: 'Sad to be selling my stunning townhouse in Scotland. Brilliant news is after trying for two years I'm buying my ex out of my dream home.' The couple continued to live in the family home for some time after their acrimonious separation. In her recently published autobiography, Mone admitted she put laxatives in her husband's coffee, let down his tyres and cut holes in his boxer shorts. She also said that on one occasion while they were still sharing the marital home, she poured cold water on his side of the bed. Ms Mone said later: 'I am sorry for that. Sorry for that woman I became. It wasn't nice at all.' After she moved into the townhouse in Park Circus, she opened the doors of the home for a photoshoot with Hello! magazine, describing the property as her 'new beginning'.

In conjunction with his sponsor Bose, McIlroy has released a video chronicling his journey from playing the back greens as a youngster to conquering the golfing world - plus a few low points along the way. The video begins with McIlroy embarking on a jog at the crack of dawn as the tagline 'Six weeks to Georgia' appears on the screen. The video features an interview with Rory McIlroy as a youngster before he became a golfing superstar . Old footage of McIlroy honing his golfing skills in his parent's living room feature during the video . McIlroy walks away after he threw his club into the lake at the\u00a0WGC-Cadillac Championship in March . 'Dad took me out into the course and made me hit a couple of shots and that's how I got into golf,' says a young McIlroy at the beginning of the feature. The moments of triumph are not the only events covered in the video as McIlroy's implosion at the WGC Cadillac Championship when he threw his 3-iron\u00a0in the lake out of sheer frustration is also touched upon. 'There's always going to be highs and lows,' says the Northern Irishman. 'There's been low points in my professional career.

He continues: 'I try to not talk about the Masters. People have been bringing it up since last year. It sort of means more this year because it's the only one that I haven't won. 'But, it's just another golf tournament. It can only distract from what you're trying to do which is to just go out and play as best as you can.' 'I think once you achieve something, you need to reset your goals. That's what gives you the motivation to keep coming back and keep practicing and keep trying to get better.'",

'I am sightless in my right eye,' he told Fusion and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos. Reid said he is 'over' the fear that he may not regain vision in that eye following a New Year's Day exercise accident that left him battered and bruised because 'I can\u2019t see out of my eye, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be until something comes along that\u2019ll change it.' 'Right now, I\u2019ve had 11 hours of surgery. They\u2019ve tried. I can\u2019t see out of my right eye. And that\u2019s okay, I can live with that,' he said, according to Fusion. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is pictured here on Monday in his home state of Nevada. Reid said in an interview this week that he might not ever be able to see out of his right eye again following a January accident . The lawmaker's tale of how he came to sustain broken bones in his face while working out in his Nevada home with a plastic exercise band is one that has been questioned, mostly by conservatives, especially after Reid announced last month that he would retire. A March 31\u00a0Breitbart News\u00a0story regaled the layout of Reid's Searchlight home and the master bathroom, where Reid says the accident occurred. Rumors have persisted since the January 1 accident that the Nevada mob may have been involved, even though there's no evidence to suggest the Reid was the victim of an organized attack. Last week the conservative Powerline blog suggested that Reid may have been beat up by his brother, Larry. Recounting a story brought forward by a man who says he attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting with Larry, it suggested, based on the account, that Larry and Harry may have tussled on the day in question. Referring indirectly to the rumors, Ramos told Reid, 'It looked like somebody had hit you.' Reid told the news anchor in turn that he was 'fortunate' the band only hit him in the temple. Going into further detail about the incident than he had in the past, the 75-year-old former boxer said he was using the band because 'I was trying to maintain my firmness.' 'That was my weight training,' he said. Reid explained that he was exercising in his new home in Nevada at the time when the strip 'slipped, spun me around, about, I guess four feet.' 'I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard...' he said trailing off as Ramos interrupted him with another question. Rumors have persisted since the January 1 accident that the Nevada mob may have been involved, even though there's no evidence to suggest the Reid was the victim of an organized attack. Reid is pictured here on February 3 during a Capitol Hill news conference . The longtime lawmaker, upon announcing his retirement last month, insisted his departure from the Senate was not related to the accident. And he told Ramos in the interview that aired on Tuesday that he was leaving the legislative body in two years when his current term expires because 'I want to remembered for my first 34 years in congress, not my last six.' One of the most memorable moments from Reid's career in recent years was his 2012 charge that the GOP's nominee for president, Mitt Romney, didn't pay his taxes for a decade. Reid first made the accusation during an interview with the Huffington Post, and several days later repeated it on the Senate floor. Then the highest-ranking Senator, Reid said his evidence came from former Bain Capitol colleagues of Romney's. Reid told Ramos in the Fusion interview that the episode had been 'blown way out of proportion.' 'Mitt Romney, during the time he was running for President, refused to give us his tax returns. When I ran for the Senate in 1974 that was an issue, tax returns,' Reid said. 'This has been an issue of mine for a long time.' The Democratic leader said the onus remains on Romney to produce evidence that he did pay his taxes. Reid also refused to give up the sources of his information that Romney may not have. 'Of course he paid taxes. What he didn't do is let us see his tax returns,' Reid told Ramos, claiming he's said as much 'many many times.' 'Let him give us his tax returns. Let the American people judge that,' he stated. Reid said he has 'no repentance' for dragging Romney through the mud because 'it is an issue that was important.' Asked if he had any apologies for Romney Reid was just as direct. 'Oh none, whatsoever. Zero. None,' the retiring lawmaker said.",

Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple . The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit \u2014 the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu . Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. John Clifford, said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there's 'very likely' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter. An outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly. Outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. production. Hormel Foods Corp., which owns Jennie-O, said Monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks. Turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production. Retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who'll stock up on stuffing mix, cranberries, sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional favorites. However, several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu. Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in. Other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots. Equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But despite these measures, the system doesn't always work. According to experts, the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult. And if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way. Farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs. Less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans, or a flock turning quiet. While vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time, this strain is new to North America. Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. These flocks are usually killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn, following guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The foam suffocates the birds within minutes. If birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died. Composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds. It's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella. The compost is then used as fertilizer.",

Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her \u00a33 million home. Beyonc\u00e9 went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyonc\u00e9 was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview \u2013 one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyonc\u00e9 is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyonc\u00e9's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record \u2013 it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below). We'll be donning Mango's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style. Mango Chiffon Ruffle Dress . Visit site . Boohoo Laura Curve Column Dress . Visit site .

Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity \u2013 what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful\u2026 it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible \u2013 I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story \u2013 we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'",

They are the heart of the home, the hub of dinner parties and usually the \u2018debrief of the day\u2019 meeting room. So what makes a great kitchen? It\u2019s a balance between a warm and inviting design combined with practical efficiency. After judging the kitchens on The Block last week and taking into account what buyers look for in a kitchen, property buyers expert Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design. Activity based design: . The key to ensuring the practicality of your kitchen is to zone areas of the kitchen based on activities e.g. food preparation, cooking, clean-up etc. with storage for those activities within those zones. These areas need to be easily accessible to each other and flow well (e.g. food preparation near the cooking area etc.). There\u2019s no use in a pretty kitchen when your preparation area is on the opposite end of the kitchen from your stovetop. Bench space: . This is one of the most common bugbears when buyers are looking at kitchens. Enough bench/counter space is crucial not only for food preparation but also for serving when entertaining. Scroll down for video . There was plenty of bench space in Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen on The Block . Storage space: . Plenty of storage space is essential and you need to find a good balance between design aesthetics and practicality. Take into account what\u2019s most important for you in terms of storage, as I recommended a Walk-in pantry vs a Butler\u2019s pantry, consider whether having extra space for preparation and a large area to hide your appliances is paramount to you or whether a larger area for food storage is more vital. Judge Neale Whitaker said\u00a0Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual\u00a0the flare, confidence or pizzazz' Sufficient lighting: . As the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Jury discussed when viewing Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen, it\u2019s not an area of the home that you can get away with the \u2018bare bones\u2019 when it comes to lighting. For the purpose of safety in food preparation and cooking, good lighting is paramount. Specifically in the preparation, cooking and cleaning areas, it\u2019s essential to have good quality lighting. Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen lacked lighting above the benchtop according to\u00a0Frank Valentic . Splash backs: . In the cooking and cleaning zones of the kitchen, splashbacks are important and while design is also important, it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of practicality. Try and find a good medium between something that looks great but is also low maintenance and easy to clean! The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background . Ventilation: . Akin to the bathroom, the kitchen requires great ventilation so ensure you have a good quality range hood and windows that can be opened. Valentic says there was 'great ventilation' in Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchen . Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges . Flow on: . The overall design of your home really needs to come into play when designing a kitchen. The flow between the living areas, specifically dining areas and the kitchen are important. As we mentioned when judging Jess and Ayden\u2019s and Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchens, a kitchen with a flow on to an outdoor entertaining area is very much in demand at the moment and a huge plus for buyers. Jess and Ayden\u2019s kitchen had a 'great flow' on from the living and dining areas . Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win and add $10,000 to their kitty . Valentic's example of a kitchen at 12 Kyarra Street in Hampton that would attract buyers' attention . Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design . In the end, Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen for the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Judges showed the best balance between design and a practical layout. While a kitchen is a very personal area of the home, make sure to take into account re-sale when renovating so that it doesn\u2019t affect the value of your property when you re-sell it. However,\u00a0if The Block: Triple Threat judges were the buyers this week, they would have walked away from each of the team's apartments without placing an offer. Judging trio Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer were all left largely unimpressed by the kitchens delivered by the Blockheads on last Sunday night's episode. The lacklustre performance, in the eye of the judges, meant that Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win of the series and add $10,000 to their kitty. The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background. Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges. Meanwhile, Whitaker said Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual the flare, confidence or pizzazz'. The living area, dining room, and kitchen flow onto the outdoor entertaining space .",

The midfielder netted his 12th and 13th goals of the season late in the first half to settle a scrappy encounter which the Canaries dominated without looking particularly convincing. Norwich should now fancy their chances of going on to complete a swift return to the top flight, with excellent form behind them and a favourable run of fixtures between now and the end of the season. Bradley Johnson heads home to give Norwich City the lead against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road . Johnson scores his second for the Canaries as they maintain their automatic promotion hopes with victory . Norwich City: Ruddy, Whittaker, Martin, Bassong, Olsson, Howson, Tettey, Dorrans, (Hooper 88), Johnson, (Odjidja-Ofoe 93), Hoolahan, (Redmond 79), Jerome . Unused Subs:\u00a0Becchio, R Bennett, Rudd, O'Neil . Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood, Vermijl, (Buxton 45), Lees, Dielna, Mattock, Maguire, Lee, Melo Silva, Isgrove (Nuhiu 45), McGugan, Lavery (Bus 78) Substitutes:\u00a0Hutchinson, May, Zayatte, Kirkland . Ref: Carl Boyeson . Att: 22,993 . Alex Neil's side had an early shout for a penalty waved away when Tom Lees appeared to bundle over Cameron Jerome in the box but referee Carl Boyeson awarded a corner. When the ball came in it was only half-cleared and Stephen Whittaker's well-struck effort was deflected over. The in-form Canaries continued to look the side more likely to break the deadlock although they were almost caught on the break when Martin Olsson carelessly lost possession on the halfway line. Lloyd Isgrove drove into the box but the angle was tight and he dragged his shot just wide of the far post. Caolan Lavery then failed to get a free header on target as the Owls continued to pose a threat on the break but Norwich were generally on the front foot and went close again when Alex Tettey tested Keiran Westwood with another stinging drive from distance. Whittaker then fired wastefully over the top after being set up by Wes Hoolahan before Norwich took a deserved lead on 33 minutes after conjuring up a goal out of nothing. The Norwich City No 4 reels away in celebration as he doubles Norwich's lead at Carrow Road . Norwich City captain Russell Martin celebrates with the match ball as hosts grab their second of the match . The Norwich City fans celebrate as Johnson's double sends them on their way to victory at Carrow Road . Wednesday should really have cleared their lines after a cross from the left was overhit but Jonny Howson forced a hurried punt that ended up picking up Johnson at the back post and the midfielder outjumped his marker to head past Westwood. Norwich now had their tails up and made it 2-0 in first-half stoppage time when Johnson doubled his tally from a corner. More poor defending from the visitors saw the ball drop kindly for the midfielder and he needed no second invitation to blast the ball home from just outside the six-yard box via a slight deflection. Johnson might have completed a swift hat-trick on 49 minutes with a deflected low drive from Hoolahan's free-kick but Westwood did well to gather the ball cleanly. The second half developed into a somewhat scrappy affair, with neither side dominating, although Kieran Lee shot just wide on 62 minutes as the visitors gave as good as they got. Norwich were looking comfortable without posing much of a threat, safe in the knowledge they had the points wrapped up barring an unlikely comeback from a side with nothing but pride to play for. Howson tried his luck from 25 yards with no success as the game drifted towards its conclusion, with Wednesday having to play the last eight minutes with 10 men as defender Claude Dielna went off with a hamstring injury with all the substitutes used. Substitute Nathan Redmond went close with a shot across the face of goal - but a third would have flattered the hosts.

This is the drill that was used by thieves\u00a0during the \u00a360million Hatton Garden heist over the Easter weekend. The gang used the power tool to cut through the  wall of the secured vault where they raided 72 security boxes before escaping with wheelie bins full of precious gems. The photograph of the Hilti DD350 drill was released tonight by Scotland Yard  as the officer in charge of the investigation said the crime had been carried out by an 'Ocean's 11 type team'. Police are offering a \u00a320,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the raid. The six men were captured on CCTV as they carried out the bold raid in London's diamond district. They used the drill to cut through a concrete wall into the bank's strongroom, where they ransacked security vaults. But, amazingly, the hole used by the gang was just 45cm wide and 25cm high - meaning they would have had something of a squeeze to muscle their way into the basement. Images of the scene show the mayhem that detectives discovered when they arrived at the crime scene in London's diamond district. Safety deposit boxes were strewn across the floor while power tools - including the heavy duty Hilti DD350 used to access the vaults - were discarded nearby. Scotland Yard also described how there was rubbish covering the Hatton Garden basement,\u00a0while the wrought-iron cage door had been broken down. An angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars were found amid the security boxes. Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building, indicating that they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside. One of the theories behind the  heist is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises. The Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company is housed in a seven-storey building, which accommodates 60 other businesses, including watch traders and diamond wholesalers. The thieves appeared to have disabled the communal lift on the second floor, before using the lift shaft - which was destroyed when police officers arrived\u00a0at\u00a0the scene - to climb down to the vault. Breaking in: The gang used the power tool to cut through the concrete wall of the secured vault, pictured . Caught on CCTV: Scotland Yard previously released several images of the gang as they entered the premises . Reward:\u00a0Police are offering a \u00a320k reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal . Unaware: The men had their faces covered, but sources have suggested they were not aware of the camera . They then opened shutter doors into the basement, before boring holes into the basement wall. Appearing on the BBC's Crimewatch tonight, Detective Superintendent Craig Turner, head of the Flying Squad, said that the theft had been carried out by an 'almost Ocean's 11 type team'. Mr Turner said: 'This was a particularly ambitious burglary to say the least and has affected so many victims. 'People's property has been taken, people's pensions, people's heirlooms which obviously can't be replaced by insurance firms. 'We may well be misled - this is carried out by an almost Ocean's 11 type team, but in essence there are victims behind this and these are callous thieves.' Destruction: Dramatic pictures released yesterday show the scenes of chaos found by detectives when they arrived at the crime scene in London, where burglars had strewn safety deposit boxes across the floor . Covered in dust and debris: Left, the forced door to the vault and, right, the mess left in the corridor . Inside knowledge: The gang managed to access the security boxes without damaging the vault door, pictured . Carefully planned: Officers said there was no sign of forced entry to the building and that the thieves had disabled the communal lift on the second floor and then used the lift shaft (pictured) to climb down . Peter Kirkham, a former DCI with the Met Police who worked for the Flying Squad for five years in the mid-90s, said police photos of the scene supported his belief that the  heist was an inside job. Another former Flying Squad detective said: 'Everything you see indicates a very specialist knowledge both in what was inside the building and how to deal with it. Thursday, April 2:\u00a0Workers from businesses in the building go home for long Easter weekend. Some have claimed the thieves were already hiding inside the building waiting to be locked in. Friday, April 3:\u00a0Police have found no signs of forced entry at the premises, but an intruder alarm sounded at the safety deposit business in the basement at 00:21. No police car was sent. Traders have claimed a security guard attended the site but said he 'wasn't paid enough' to look inside the vaults. Saturday, April 4, Sunday April 5 and Monday, April 6:\u00a0The exact time of the raid has not been confirmed, but given the amount of time it would have taken to drill through the concrete wall and opened 70 safety deposit boxes, it is thought to have taken many hours. Tuesday, April 7:\u00a0At 8am, workers return to the building and finding 'scenes of chaos'. They call the police, who attend. 'There is an expertise, combined with strength, patience, determination and, probably, an inside knowledge.' Releasing the scene images yesterday,\u00a0Scotland Yard said forensics had finished examining the scene and that it had taken a 'significant amount of time'. The force said the team had recorded, packaged and recovered approximately 400 exhibits, including items for DNA profiling, fingerprints and other evidence. Specialist forensic photographers have also mapped out the crime scene and utilised digital techniques to record the inside of the premises, it said. Speaking tonight, Mr Turner appealed for members of the public who may have been in the Hatton Garden area during the theft and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward. Describing the drill that had been found at the scene as a 'specialised bit of equipment', he called for members of the criminal community who may have seen the gang in possession of it to get in touch. There are still six victims who have not been identified yet by police, Mr Turner said. 'I appeal to any of those victims who haven't been contacted by police to contact the incident room,' he added. The police previously released CCTV footage showing the suspects believed to be involved in the heist . The picture showed three suspects, using a side door to the building, as well as a van used by the gang .",

Brae Carnes of Victoria, British Columbia, has photographed herself over the past few months as she applies makeup and even changes in men's public restrooms, sometimes when men are even going to the bathroom right behind her. This to protest a proposed amendment to a Canadian\u00a0transgender rights bill that would allow owners to make their own decisions as to whether or not to allow transgender individuals to use facilities corresponding to their gender. Scroll down for video . Brae Carnes (above) of Victoria, British Columbia is protesting an amendment to a Canadian transgender rights bill . Carnes has begun posting photos of herself applying makeup and even changing in men's public bathrooms (above) 'I\u2019m giving them what they want,' Carnes said of the photos in an interview with the Times Colonist. 'I\u2019m actively showing them what it would look like if that became law and how completely ridiculous it is. It\u2019s just not right.' On top of that, Carnes revealed that it is scary to go into a men's public bathroom as a woman. A bill to grant equal rights and protections to transgender individuals and protect them from discrimination has been stuck in the Canadian senate for almost two years now. Recently, Senator Don Plett introduced this new amendment to the bill. He argues it is more a protection for women who may be afraid to share a space with anyone who is 'biologically male.' The new amendment would allow business owners to determine if they want to allow transgender individuals to use facilities corresponding with their gender . 'I\u2019m actively showing them what it would look like if that became law and how completely ridiculous it is,' says Carnes . The transgender community meanwhile has pointed out the issue of their own protection should they be forced to use a bathroom that does not correspond with their gender identity. 'I think [the amendment] is actually giving predators a chance and an opportunity. People think, \"Why\u2019s this girl in the washroom? She must be looking for a guy,\"' said Carnes.",

Nobody else would get close. This has been his best season in a Chelsea shirt. Two seasons ago Rafa Benitez said he couldn\u2019t cope with two games a week. That will have frightened the life out of John. So credit Jose Mourinho for trusting him and building that defence around him. Terry has never had pace but that is not a problem as he reads the game so well. He didn\u2019t break sweat against Arsenal and Chelsea were too streetwise for Arsene Wenger\u2019s team. John Terry celebrates after the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium . Chelsea are undefeated against the top four this season where Arsenal have lost twice \u2014 that is the gap Wenger\u2019s side need to bridge and Terry has been a huge part of that. I remember playing against him early in his career and after I tackled Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, he clattered right into me \u2014 he wasn\u2019t going to let me put one on his team-mate. That\u2019s when I knew he could grow up to be a special player. Terry  celebrates with his team-mates after the Premier League draw against Arsenal in north London . One Hull of a result . Beating Crystal Palace was a massive result for Steve Bruce. Their run-in is horrendous and had they lost at Selhurst Park, surely it was all over. It shows how football fortunes can change in an instant. Hull are not the best away from home but as the stats below show, they thoroughly deserved their win. Dame N\u2019Doye was the star and could have had a hatful but I love the way he took his second. That little delay of his foot was just enough to put the defender off balance and give him a sight of goal before firing it in. Bruce had to move quickly to sign him on deadline day in February but N\u2019Doye has done well since joining from Lokomotiv Moscow. If he carries on like this and Hull stay up they might have to build a statue outside the ground! Dame N'Doye  celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Premier League win against Crystal Palace . Can Manuel still be the man? After recent results, people say Manuel Pellegrini is a dead man walking. Beating Aston Villa was important but can he keep his job under so much pressure? Deciding Pellegrini\u2019s fate will be one of the toughest choices Man City\u2019s owners have faced. I spoke to Frank Lampard and he says they are fantastic people \u2014 there is no desire to chop and change. City are so close. They have world class training facilities, an expanding stadium and absolute fortunes to spend. But this season has been a blip. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during the Premier League match against Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium . Pellegrini won two trophies last year, so they could keep him and let him rebuild. Recruitment has been poor and they need to get it right in the summer. But it\u2019s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year. If he is sacked, who gets the job? Pep Guardiola is the dream but it would take a major fallout for him to leave Bayern. Patrick Vieira has the tools but no experience, Jurgen Klopp would be appointed on past success and Diego Simeone is an underdog manager. City want style. There is no shame losing to Barcelona, it\u2019s the defeats to the likes of Burnley and Stoke that have hurt Pellegrini. City could still get rid of him, but I\u2019m sure it would be with a heavy heart. Manchester City are dreaming of Pep Guardiola but it's unlikely the Bayern boss will make the move to City . Flying Foxes . Talk about timing your run. Leicester are in amazing form. Four straight wins is good for any side, let alone one facing a relegation battle. It\u2019s been a tough season for Nigel Pearson with all the drama of him being \u2018sacked\u2019 and reinstated, but he has got his team flying at exactly the right time. Home disadvantage? There were only two home wins this weekend with three away and five draws. At this stage in the season sometimes it\u2019s far easier to play with freedom on the road than under huge pressure at home. Toon's poor show . The way Newcastle are going I would not be surprised if they don\u2019t get a single point between now and the end of the season. They have been an embarrassment. It\u2019s as if they are in the clubhouse with 35 points. They don\u2019t look like adding to that any time soon and anybody with Newcastle in their run-in has got a chance of a result. A deflated Jack Colback and Siem de Jong trudge off the pitch following yet another Newcastle defeat . The Newcastle players react as they suffer yet another defeat, this time to Premier League rivals Swansea . Chaos at Watford, but it works . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates scoring for Watford against Brighton at the Amex Stadium . Watford have spent 20 days at the top of the Championship table. Bournemouth, who are on the verge of promotion, have led for 111 days. Congratulations to Watford after their promotion, but if ever you want an example of how not to run a club, they have been it this season! With unpredictable owners, four different managers and a host of key players on loan, it has been chaos. They have been outsiders throughout but have come through when it counts. I\u2019ve loved watching Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo bang in the goals and you can\u2019t argue with the results. It just shows you there\u2019s no right or wrong in football. The Watford players celebrate victory against Brighton as they all but secure their promotion to the big time . United slip up . Two weeks ago Man United had all the answers but two defeats later it\u2019s back to the drawing board. It\u2019s not that they have been found out, but maybe they are not as good as people thought. They were just in good form. They have had the luxury of playing with no European football this season so still have work to do in the summer. It\u2019s the same feeling with Everton. They started the season dreadfully but have won five out of six. I\u2019m a Roberto Martinez fan and they have good players so we should not be surprised that things have changed. Louis van Gaal watches on as his Manchester United side are comprehensively beaten by Everton . Paying the penalty . Why oh why did Danny Ings not take that penalty for Burnley? Yes, he is out of form and without a goal since February but what better way to get back on the scoresheet? He took one against Aston Villa in November and scored and he and Burnley needed that goal. Then to make things worse Leicester go up the other end and score 27 seconds later. Burnley midfielder Matthew Taylor holds his head after missing the chance to score from the spot . It was a similar story at QPR. Charlie Austin\u2019s goals have kept his side going this season but he has missed two big penalties now \u2014 against Hull and West Ham. When every goal is so vital you can\u2019t afford to pass up these chances. PS If QPR go down, Austin won\u2019t be the only player with plenty of suitors. Matt Phillips has been scoring and setting up good goals in the run-in. He is a useful Premier League player. Charlie Austin looks on angrily following his penalty miss against West Ham United at Loftus Road .",

New research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food. Scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old Neanderthal teeth found in El Sidron, Spain. Neanderthals (represented in the drawing above) may have been the world's first gourmets - using herbs like yarrow and camomile to flavour the meat that dominated their diet, according to a new scientific paper . At first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self-medication, but now new findings have presented a different theory. Dr Sabrina Krief, a lecturer at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable. Neanderthals may have cooked stews in the skins of animals, according to some anthropologists. Animal bones found at sites known to have been inhabited by Neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnaw marks. This suggests that fat and meat had instead been cooked off the bones. A study of tooth plaque from the teeth of fossilised Neanderthal remains also suggest that they may have heated grains of barley. However, there is no evidence that Neanderthals had any pots or pans to cook with. Instead\u00a0Professor John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, believes that they used animal paunches and folded bark to make bags that they could boil their good in. A study of plaque found on Neanderthal teeth like the one above suggests they ate grains like barley . They have found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda eat three different types of leaf while consuming meat they had caught. They say Neanderthals could also used herbs to improve their culinary creations in the same way. There is already evidence that they cooked their food and may even have created stews in the skins of animals. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Krief and her colleagues said: 'Data on Neanderthal behaviour suggest that their subsistence and technological strategies were complex.' Neanderthals have long been portrayed as a rather primitive form of human that died out as they were unable to compete with the more sophisticated modern humans that arrived in Europe and Asia from Africa. However, recent discoveries have shown that they may actually have had a complex culture - capable of making stone tools and even jewellery. Three years ago researchers at the University of Barcelona examined ten teeth from the remains of five Neanderthals found in El Sidron, northern Spain. In the dental plaque of one young adult they discovered three compounds that occur naturally in yarrow and camomile. Dr Karen Hardy and her team, who conducted that work, suggested that these plants had been used to help ward off illness or treat a diease. Yarrow for example has been used in the past to treat fever and to stem bleeding. However it was also a popular vegetable in the 17th century, while the leaves can also be dried and used as a herb. It is said to produce a pungent odour while having a slightly sweet and peppery taste that has been described as similar to spinach. Camomile was also a popular treatment for inflammation, hayfever and stomach problems, but is still used to today to flavour foods in top restaurants. Neither of the plants have much nutritional value but both convey strong flavours. Dr Krief and her team found that separate groups of chimpanzees at Budongo Forest Reserve and Kibale National Park ate plants while chewing meat. New archaeological discoveries are expanding our knowledge of how Neanderthals lived in ways that could not have been imagined when their fossilised remains, like the skeleton above, were first found by archaeologists . Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has become well known for his subtle use of flavours that contrasts with his rather brutish approach in the kitchen, but it seems he could also have learned some tips from Neanderthals . Neanderthals, like the one shown above, may well have been the world's first gourmet chefs, findings suggest . They reason that if this was for medicinal purposes, different animals would eat different plants depending on their ailments. However, the animals in each group all tended to eat the same plants with their meat, suggesting they were eating them for flavour instead. Dr Krief said that previous work has dismissed the idea that Neanderthals were eating herbs to flavour food based on the assumption that their tastes were very basic. However, she says that if chimpanzees use plants to flavour their food, then it is entirely possible that Neanderthals also used herbs and spices. Writing in Antiquity, the researchers said: 'The strong, bitter taste of the leaves may modify the flavour of the viscera, muscles, organs or water. 'In a French cookbook, a recipe proposes cooking a blanquette of veal with camomile. 'The bitter taste of the cooked plant does not necessarily disappear completely; camomile, for example, remains bitter when infused. 'The presence of cooked carbohydrates, esters, phenols, pyrene and florathene in calculus samples from El Sidron supports the hypothesis that Neanderthals were cooking plant food and perhaps smoking food, confirming that they were able to practice different food-processing techniques. 'It is suggested that, among other cooking methods, roasting, heating or even potentially boiling to make soup, stew or stock might have been used by Neanderthals. 'Such a variety of practices, combined with the fact that the samples from El Sidr\u00b4on reveal the presence of smoke-related compounds, show that Neanderthals were using food processing at least as complex as flavouring food with plant material.' Other recent discoveries are starting to reveal what culinary creatures the Neanderthals were. Camomile is well known as a herb that can produce some interesting flavours for dishes and was eaten by Neanderthals according to recent research on dental plaque that had hardened onto fossiled teeth . Yarrow is a hardy plant but its leaves can be used as a herb known for its sweet flavour and bitter aftertaste . Research presented at the Paleoanthropology Society Annual Meeting this week suggests they tended to eat horses, deer and bovids rather than larger game like mammoths. According to New Scientist, Geoff Smith, from the Monrepos Archaeological Research Centre in Germany, said they also seemed to have sucked out the fatty marrow from bones. There is also some evidence from Neanderthal sites in Gibralter that suggests they also liked nuts and wild olives. Analysis of fossilised Neanderthal faeces has also revealed that while they ate meat, they also had a 'significant intake of plants'. Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said: 'This paper reminds us that the Neanderthals were complicated and sophisticated humans. 'While the data from dental calculus might be evidence for medicinal plants this new research highlights a number of alternative explanations; the most intriguing of which is the use of food flavourings. 'The comparison with chimps must be used carefully as they are a very different animal but the complex array of behaviours seen in world chimps gives us even more to marvel at when we think about what the Neanderthals were capable of.' Neanderthals first emerged around 280,000 years ago, spreading to inhabit much of Europe and parts of Asia, but they eventually died out 40,000 years ago. The reason for their demise was often put down to being a more primative species of human that was unable to compete against the more sophisticated Homo sapiens. They were depicted as thuggish cavemen that scraped an existence on the cold lands of ice age Europe. However, a series of discoveries are now putting Neanderthals into a new light. Stone tools discovered at sites they inhabited suggest they were skilled tool makers with adept hand eye coordination. A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France also suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices . A recent discovery by researchers at the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris suggests that Neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them. They discovered a 26 feet wide building created 44,000 years ago from mammoth bones. Many of the bones had also been decorated carvings and ochre pigments. Cross-hatched engravings found inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. DNA analysis has also shown that Neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak. Eight talons found at a 130,000 year old Neanderthal site in Krapina in Croatia are also thought to be the world's first jewellery, and may have been worn as a necklace. The traditional image of Neanderthals as primitive creatures like above is no longer holding up to evidence .",

Many Britons know the resort because of popular comedy Benidorm, featuring The Garvey Family (pictured) Spain already boasts more than 40 Unesco world heritage sites, including Granada's Alhambra Palace and Donana National Park in Huelva. Benidorm officials said the mass-market resort was applying in order to reinvent its own image. 'It's the most sustainable and best-designed city of the Mediterranean,' said Mayor Agust\u00edn Navarro. 'We want to protect all that we've achieved during the recent decades as well as give it dignity and value.' A decision over the application could take up to six years to be made.

Female stars including Nancy Dell'Olio, Josie Gibson, Jamelia and Susanna Reid have all stepped up to the plate for Good Morning Britain's initiative, which launched today, as well as male contenders including Piers Morgan and Richard Madeley. According to a survey conducted by the ITV breakfast show, women take an average of six selfies before posting one online and men take four, such is the pressure to look their very best on social media. Scroll down for video . Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid, 44, shared her first unfiltered selfie (pictured) in aid of the #SelfieEsteem, which celebrates women as they are . Speaking on the show earlier this morning, former Big Brother star Ms Gibson, 30, said: 'I take about 100 [selfies] before I get the right one. Yeah about 100, and then I\u2019ve started adding filters these days.' She continued: 'I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person in the country who has suffered from low self-esteem. 'I know that some of the most beautiful women have got no self-esteem at all and when you\u2019ve got low self-esteem it doesn\u2019t just ruin relationships, it also affects your life. 'I\u2019ve not gone for so many opportunities because I have had such low self-esteem at the time.\u00a0I\u2019ve been invited to amazing events and I\u2019ve not gone because I\u2019ve couldn\u2019t find anything to wear. Nancy Dell'Olio, 53, puckered up for her close-range selfie . Ex-Big Brother star Josie Gibson, 30, (pictured) uploaded her selfie in aid of the campaign and admitted, 'I\u2019ve not gone for so many opportunities because I have had such low self-esteem at the time' Singer Jamelia, 34, flashed her best smile as she invited others to follow her example . Former TOWIE star\u00a0Lydia Rose Bright, 25, looked radiant in her unfiltered snap . Ms Gibson added: 'I\u2019ve got such low-self esteem and you compare yourself to all these people are in their nice little bodycons [dresses], looking great and you think \"oh I don\u2019t belong there.\"' GMB presenter Susanna Reid, 44, who also shared her first unfiltered selfie in support of the campaign, said: 'It makes me so upset to hear someone beautiful and fabulous and wonderful saying that. 'No-one should be saying I don\u2019t want to go out because I\u2019m so worried about how I look.' Ms Reid captioned her photo: 'We're encouraging you to post the first unfiltered selfie for @gmb #SelfieEsteem campaign (hair & make-up allowed).\"' MailOnline's US Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan grinned his way through his submission . TV personality Michelle Heaton, 35, threw a matching pose with her daughter Faith . Former Westlife hunk Nicky Byrne, 36, looked more than happy to partake . Other stars to suspend their vanity for the sake of the campaign have included ITV presenter Ben Shephard, 40, former Westlife crooner Nicky Byrne, 36, TV personality Michelle Heaton, 35, who posed with her daughter Faith, and Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle, 30. Singer Rebecca Ferguson, 28, was heavily made up in her selfie, and flashed her ample cleavage, while it was hard to believe Vogue Williams' snap hadn't been doctored, judging by the perfection of her skin. According to GMB's survey - conducted on 2,000 men and 2,000 women - four out of ten women and three out of ten men avoid looking in the mirror due to low self-esteem. Singer Rebecca Ferguson, 28, was heavily made up in her selfie, and flashed her ample cleavage . it was hard to believe Vogue Williams' snap hadn't been doctored, judging by the perfection of her skin, but perhaps it was simply good lighting at play . GMB host Kate Garraway, 47, also posed for a quick snap . Ben Shephard, 40, shared a similar speedy selfie . Nearly half of women and almost a third of men  are unhappy with the way they look, according to the poll, and their weight was the number one thing both sexes would like to change. The survey also questioned 1,000 children aged eight to 17 on their self-esteem and found that 79 per cent were happy with the way they looked, and over half took selfies. Despite this, a third of women worried they were passing on body confidence issues to their children and 41 per cent of children did not think their mother was happy with the way she looked. Worryingly, it was also found that 15 per cent of women and a fifth of men had cropped, filtered, or retouched pictures of their children. Founder of the SelfEsteem Team, Natasha Devon (pictured), was delighted with the response from her campaign . Submissions also poured in from viewers, including Leyla Carter (left) Chloe Jervis (right) Charlotte Hobbs (left) admits she usually takes ten selfies before settling on the best one, while Jackie Brown (right) was also stepping out of her comfort zone .",

Seven-year-old Lacey McCarty, six-year-old Phillip McCarty and five-month-old Christopher Swist died allegedly at the hands of their mother, Jessica McCarty, in a botched murder-suicide. Christopher Swist - father of the five-month-old and the man who was dating Jessica McCarty just before the alleged killings - had nicknames for all of the children and coached the two oldest in little league baseball. Scroll down for video . Jessica McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Lacey McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself . McCarty was arrested on March 20 and faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incident. Investigators say she left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do' Just 24 hours before their death, he took pictures of the two oldest children at their latest game, and both looked happy as ever, Swist said. 'The kids loved everything about Little League,' Swist told People. 'The past two years, we watched the Little League World Series on ESPN. Our families were always at all the games.' Their love of the sport was so strong that  Palm Bay City Council has renamed a little league field in their town 'Angels' Field' in memory of the children. Swist said that he had a great bond with the children, calling Lacey 'Chick', Christopher 'Toe Toe' and Phillip 'Smash'. As he comes to terms with the tragic deaths of the three kids he loved so much, Swist has created a non-profit organization titled 3 Angels Ball For All, in hopes of helping disadvantaged youth play organizational sports. Jessica McCarty still faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incidents that occurred on March 20. McCarty's partner, Christopher Swist, who she was reportedly on a break with at the time of the alleged murders, coached her two oldest children in little league baseball . Swist, who was only the father of the youngest slain child, said he had a close bond with all three children and gave them all nicknames to go by . Swist called seven-year-old Lacey (right picture, left) 'Chick', five-month-old Christopher (left) 'Toe Toe' and six-year-old Phillip 'Smash' (right). Each nickname supposedly had a story behind it . McCarty was arrested after she called 911 and told police she'd killed her children. Lacey and Philip were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children  but lost his fight for life in the days following the attack. 'Our hearts go out to the friends and family who have lost children in such a horrific manner. The fathers of these helpless, innocent children struggling is simply gut wrenching,' said acting Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said after the incident. According to Renkens, there had recently been a break in the relationship between McCarty and  Swist. Lacey and Phillip where pronounced dead shortly after they were found unresponsive. Christopher held on for a couple days before dying at the hospital . McCarty was arrested after calling 911 on herself and telling the police she had killed her three children . When Swist arrived on scene - after McCarty had sent him photos of blood throughout the house - and found the children unresponsive. He then called the police . Investigators said McCarty sent photos to Swist of blood throughout the house. Swist arrived first at the scene and found his son unresponsive on his bed, police said. Police said they found a journal in the driveway of the home that was addressed 'To my family,' which indicated that McCarty was sorry for what she 'had to do.' There was also another page addressed to Christopher's father, asking him to keep her son's name alive, police said. In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appeared in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape. The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has not been revealed. However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the DCF for possible child neglect. The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. Phillip McCarty (left) was the father of the Phillip and Lacey, the two older children McCarty is believed to have killed on March 20 . McCarty and Swist had one child together - five-month-old Christopher. Police said they were on a break at the time of the incident . She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. Swist also called police when he came home. Swist now has the comfort of his city's support in mourning and remembering the three children he loved. 'All I have left is the memories that my children blessed me with,' Swist told People.\u00a0'Those moments will forever be ours together. Those children touched so many lives in the community; naming the field after them is a great way to help keep those memories alive.' And he knows he has to push on and have the strength to hold his memories close. 'I don\u2019t think you ever heal from this,' Swist told Space Coast Daily. He added: 'The best we can do is survive. The way we survive is we all stand together as one family. 'As far as you guys even thinking about naming the field, that really means a lot to us. We just can\u2019t say enough. We miss our kids. We miss our kids.' Though Phillip and Lacey were not Swist's biological children, he cared for and loved them both. He claims that the children 'touched so many lives in the community' of Palm Bay .",

Soon after arriving by high-speed TurboJET ferry from Hong Kong, we were sitting in Antonio, a beautifully tiled restaurant that could easily have been in Lisbon. The food and drink was excellent (owner Antonio Coelho whips up a mean souffle), and the fado singing of entertainer Marcelino was truly memorable. Scroll down for video . Macau has 26 casinos, including the largest in the world,\u00a0The Venetian . Located at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta at the southern tip of China, Macau comprises a peninsula and two islands \u2013 Taipa and Coloane \u2013 connected by three dramatic bridges. It was run by Portugal until 1999 when it became a special Administrative Region of China. Wandering with our guide through Macau\u2019s Historic Centre the next morning, it was evident how the Portuguese influence has been maintained through the architecture and cobbled streets. The highlights for us were the Ruins of St Paul\u2019s, elegant Senado Square, and A-Ma Temple, which is more than 500 years old. My husband Neil and I were impressed by just how clean and tidy Macau is \u2013 they even have WCs for dogs with entrances marked In and Out. Judith Chalmers and her husband travelled to the city and it didn\u2019t take them long to discover the unique appeal of Macau . After lunch at Cafe Litoral (a fusion of Portuguese, Chinese, Indian, South American, African and Malaysian flavours \u2013 it works!) we headed over to the Macau Tower, which has the world\u2019s highest bungee jump. Plunging 764ft in 17 seconds is not for the faint-hearted, but neither is Skywalk X, where you are harnessed and take a thrilling \u2013 if that\u2019s the word \u2013 walk around the outer rim of the Tower with nothing to hold on to. We were disappointed that, for technical reasons, we weren\u2019t able to see the multi-million-pound production of The House Of Dancing Water. Incredible skyline! View of Grand Lisboa and Wynn Hotel and Casino at dusk . Developed by the man behind many of Cirque du Soleil\u2019s dazzling shows, it features acrobats, motorcycle stunts and fountain effects. Mention Macau and many people automatically think \u2018casinos\u2019. There are 26 of them, including the world\u2019s biggest, The Venetian. It looks the size of Wembley and has about 500 baccarat, roulette and blackjack tables. Contrasting scenery! The peaceful Coloane island is world's apart from Macau . Gambling is illegal in Hong Kong, except on horseracing, so thousands from Hong Kong as well as mainland China try their luck here. Free shuttle buses run between the casinos, and as the doorman at our hotel, the Sofitel, said: \u2018It\u2019s either that or a Rolls-Royce!\u2019 Lord Stow's Bakery is the home to the Portuguese egg custard tart . The island of Coloane, meanwhile, has green hills, small villages and a peaceful coastline. In the Town Square we were intrigued to find Lord Stow\u2019s Bakery, home to the Portuguese egg custard tart. Launched by Englishman Andrew Stow in 1989, the store is now run by his sister Eileen, and it sells more than 3,000 of the delicacies every day. Macau has a typhoon season from June to September when the bridges can be closed, but a long tunnel keeps the traffic flowing. As a destination, it is far cheaper than Hong Kong and there is plenty of accommodation. The food is wonderful, and when you stir in the Portuguese heritage and influence, you get a fascinating and colourful melting pot.

The star, 27, seen in her Garnier Ambre Solaire campaign, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.'",

Sherwood is renowned for his fiery displays on the touchline, so how did he fare during what is undoubtedly one of the more emotive fixtures for him? Sportsmail explains... Tim Sherwood was visibly delighted at recording a victory with Aston Villa against Tottenham . CROWD REACTION . All was going well until his exuberant celebrations at the final whistle, which prompted an angry reaction from the home fans in the West Stand but he merely shook his fist at them and disappeared down the tunnel. Got an easy ride during the game, though, as the overmatched Vlad Chiriches bore the brunt of the home crowd's frustration before he was hooked in the 78th minute. Gave the Villa fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute. Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches (left) bore the brunt of the home fans' dismay against Villa . TOUCHLINE BEHAVIOUR . The bright spring day in N17 allowed to him leave his gillet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time. He did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part. Little more than a subtle fist pump when Christian Benteke scored what proved to be the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle. Clearly still loves having a go at 4th official, who got an earful on occasion. Christian Benteke (centre) headed the winning goal for Villa on the 35th minute at White Hart Lane . Sherwood coud not resist a lively celebration when the final whistle confirmed the victory for Villa . Told someone on the Spurs bench to 'shut the f*** up' as tempers flared on the bench during stoppage time. INTERACTION . Very little on this front with Tony Parks, who was one of his lieutenants here at Spurs, doing most of the talking. Stayed ice cool throughout although did nearly hit the roof when Andreas Weimann shot tamely at Michel Vorm with five minutes to go. Sherwood (centre) celebrated in a subdued manner when Benteke's header found the back of the net . Sherwood (left) and assistant Tony Parks were lively throughout the game on the touchline . Did not even acknowledge Sanchez as he meandered down the following his stoppage time red card. TACTICS . Like he did here with Emmanuel Adebayor, Sherwood has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring. Christian Benteke, who fronted a three-pronged attack, scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second half Spurs fight back, although it never seemed to come. Benteke points to the sky in celebration after hitting the back of the net for Villa at Tottenham . Sherwood has helped Belgium striker Benteke rediscover his scoring form since taking over . VERDICT . Low-key return for Sherwood who nailed the game plan and left with three precious points for his side. Looks a different, more relaxed man to the one who could be spotted in the home technical area here during the second half of last season. Although he showed a glimpse of the old Tim at the final whistle as his side took a step closer to Premier League safety.

And now the firm has announced it is cutting his pay. In his prime: GoPro creator Nick Woodman, 39, is set to be named America's highest-paid CEO of 2014 . Woodman's product - a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, or a hand-held pole - made waves in when it debuted in 2006.

Before sales took off, Woodman posed as the model for their self-made adverts. But his posing days didn't last long. In 2006, the firm launched its first digital camera. Three years later it began selling a high-definition camera. The cameras are light, small and waterproof. They have other uses besides sports. TV producers use them to film in areas where big professional cameras can't go. Since launching its high-definition camera in 2009, it has sold 8.5 million of them, including 3.8 million in 2013. Its cameras are sold in more than 25,000 stores and cost between $200 and $400. The day the company first went public, they sold 3.6 million shares of GoPro stock to rake in an astounding $86 million before taxes.

They are WiFi capable, typically come with remotes for control and have a capacity of 64GB currently. They are also versatile thanks to numerous add-ons, including LCD screens, and the most expensive model is $400. Woodman's father, Dean, has also found himself an overnight millionaire. The elder Woodman loaned his son $200,000 to help get GoPro off the ground. Dean Woodman - who sold none of his shares at the IPO - now owns $280 million in GoPro shares. As Forbes notes, that is a 140,000 percent return on his initial $200,000 investment. Its list of competitors is short, but growing. Consumer electronics companies Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market. GoPro had the best-selling camcorder in 2013, according to government paperwork filed by the company. It also sells accessories such as cases, battery packs and mounts that help users attach their cameras to surfboards, helmets or their wrists. It also has a free app and software that lets users edit, store and publish their videos to their social media accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Additional growth may come from the wild videos its cameras create, which the company hopes to use to create a media company.

In a letter he sent to his strategic management students, Professor Irwin Horwitz claimed that he had seen cheating, heard false rumors about himself and other students and had been called a 'f****** moron' to his face. Horwitz's email said that every single student in the approximately 30-person class would fail because of the behavior he had witnessed during the semester. The university has said that the failing grades Horwitz's wishes to give out will not hold. Texas A&M, Galveston, professor Irwin Horwitz emailed his strategic management class of about 30 students telling them he was going to fail all of them because of the bad behavior he had seen during the semester . In the email - he sent a similar one to administrators - he claimed students cheated in class and participated in 'inappropriate conduct' His email to his students read: 'None of you, in my opinion, given the behavior in this class, deserve to pass, or graduate to become an Aggie, as you do not in any way embody the honor that the university holds graduates should have within their personal character. 'Since teaching this course, I have caught and seen cheating, been told to \u2018chill out,\u2019 \u2018get out of my space,\u2019 \u2018go back and teach,\u2019 [been] called a \u2018f****** moron\u2019 to my face, [had] one student cheat by signing in for another, one student not showing up but claiming they did, listened to many hurtful and untrue rumors about myself and others, been caught between fights between students\u2026.

'You all lack the honor and maturity to live up to the standards that Texas A&M holds, and the competence and/or desire to do the quality work necessary to pass the course just on a grade level\u2026. I will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade.' Inside Higher Ed . 'It is thus for these reasons why I am officially walking away from this course. I am frankly and completely disgusted. 'You all lack the honor and maturity to live up to the standards that Texas A&M holds, and the competence and/or desire to do the quality work necessary to pass the course just on a grade level\u2026. I will no longer be teaching the course, and all are being awarded a failing grade.' Horwitz, who has taught at the college level for 20 years, sent a similar email to senior administrators telling them what he had done, according to Inside Higher Ed. He predicted that his students would protest his decision and told administration that the students were 'your problem now'. A university spokesman said that across-the-board failing grades would be re-evaluated. 'No student who passes the class academically will be failed. That is only the right thing to do,' he said. He added that Horwitz's accusations are being investigated and 'disciplinary action will be taken' against those students who behaved inappropriately. Horwitz, who said he will not teach the class again, called his class's behavior 'disgraceful' and told\u00a0KPRC\u00a0that he had never failed a class before and rarely gave out failing grades. 'I was dealing with cheating, dealing with individuals swearing at me both in and out of class, it got to the point that the school had to put security guards at that class and another class,' he said. 'Sometimes learning incorporates tough love.' Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class and each student will be judged academically by the department head rather than Horwitz for the remainder of the semester . He said that his students told him to 'chill out' and cited student cheating in his email. 'It became apparent that they couldn't do some of the most simple and basic things they should have been able to do,' Horwitz told KPRC. Vice President of Academic Affairs Patrick Lauchouarn said that Horwitz cannot give failing grades to an entire class, especially before the end of the semester, in May. 'None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail because he or she has not performed the expectations for that particular class,' he said. The department head at the university will teach the course for the remainder of the semester and grades will be evaluated based on academics, school officials said. Horowitz said he would not teach the strategic management class again at the Galveston campus (pictured) and that in his 20 years of teaching he had never failed an entire class .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nTen years ago, I signed a letter backing Labour in the 2005 Election. Earlier this month I signed a letter backing the Conservatives for this one. Why the conversion? I'm not a tribally political animal. I am someone who runs and starts businesses, but most importantly wants to see our country succeed. I back whatever works. Five years ago the world was facing catastrophic economic problems. We had stared into the abyss of a complete failure of the international financial system, and managed \u2013 via huge State intervention \u2013 to avoid total collapse. The recovery of the UK since then has been extraordinary. We have outperformed every other major economy. Former Blair ally Charles Dunstone (pictured) is now supporting the Conservative Party in the election . When I speak to investors and business people around the world, they see the recent British story as something of a miracle. The jobs figures alone are astounding: 2 million more people are in work \u2013 a figure representing many, many personal triumphs. Businesses are starting in record numbers. I really believe David Cameron and George Osborne deserve much of the credit for this incredible turnaround. But back to ten years ago. In 2005 I supported New Labour because they had ended the tyranny of 'or' \u2013 the idea that you could only have a strong and growing economy 'or' a fair and compassionate society. New Labour recognised that the one helped pay for the other; healthy tax receipts from business meant more money for schools, hospitals and helping the poorest in our country. Put simply, Tony Blair understood that in order to spend money, you first need to earn money. I'm genuinely concerned that this view isn't shared by the current Labour Party \u2013 and that business is viewed as the problem, rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society. What's more, they do not seem to understand how businesses work. Take their energy-freeze policy. This betrays a basic misunderstanding of how markets work. Companies would have elevated prices in anticipation of a freeze \u2013 and kept them high despite the recent drop in the price of oil. This is just one clumsy intervention that would end up costing people money. The current Government has made it very clear that the UK is open for business and endeavours to make business welcome here. It's vital, because fundamentally, the business world is driven by confidence and positive sentiment. The former Carphone Warehouse boss said Mr Cameron deserved credit for turning around the economy . However, it is very fragile and hard to nurture, and the mobility of the modern business world means a tech firm can start up as easily in Berlin or Silicon Valley as they can in London, so they're not going to pick a place which they perceive will make it hard for them to thrive. We need a government that backs business, not one that views us as cartoon capitalists; a necessary evil to bring in money at best; the embodiments of greed at worst. Because the truth is the vast majority of those working in business are trying to build something good and to employ more people. There is such a thing as turning an honest profit. The man running a local bakery and employing ten people is a capitalist. The woman starting up a tech firm in her attic is a capitalist. These people are doing our economy and our society a service. They are not to be stigmatised but backed. I'm backing the Conservatives for this Election as they've shown a determination to stick to the course even when the tide of opinion was turning against them. A couple of years ago, a chorus of voices were urging George Osborne to change direction. He ignored them, the plan paid off, and now those same people are patting him on the back for his resolve. I like what they've done for small businesses too. Everyone's got to start somewhere. I started selling mobile phones from my flat. And in the age of the start-up, government has to make life easier for people to get going. He said the current Labour Party, under Ed Miliband, viewed business as the problem, rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society . I was speaking to an Italian contact recently who told me that anyone starting a small business in Italy gets sucked into a quagmire of bureaucracy, treated like some massive enterprise with their own accounting department. He couldn't believe that in Britain you could get online and register your company in a few short steps \u2013 and that is to the Conservatives' credit. Most of all I like the confidence that is growing in our economy. What the economist Keynes called 'animal spirits'; what used to be called the feel-good factor; whatever you call it, that can-do feeling has been returning. Economic success isn't decided on high, it is the collective result of millions of people feeling that we are heading in the right direction; willing to take chances and work hard to succeed. This confidence has returned, beyond doubt \u2013 but we must make no mistake, it is a very fragile thing. Indeed, it still hasn't returned to many of our near neighbours. I'm not a party loyalist and I have never donated money to any party. But on this occasion I really felt I had to speak out as our economic recovery truly hangs in the balance. For me the choice is clear. And it is not a choice between backing business on the one hand and promoting fairness on the other. There is nothing progressive about attacking business and undermining our economy. If the economy fails, frankly it is not the richest who suffer, it's the poorest. It would be a huge and tragic irony if well-meaning people ended up hurting the most deprived in our country. But that is what I fear would happen with a Labour-SNP government \u2013 one that is anti-business, anti-aspiration and pro-spending money we haven't even earned yet. It comes down to this: we have come a long way in the past five years. Clawing our way out of recession has meant a lot of hard work and sacrifice. We are rounding the corner and really getting somewhere as a country \u2013 and we would be crazy to throw it all away now.",

Recent images show intrepid residents from Lijin village in Dongying city carry the explosive in bags as long as six metres on rickshaws, reported the\u00a0People\u2019s Daily Online. Worried passers-by compared this behaviour to carrying a bomb on their backs because any contact with a naked flame or even a cigarette could spell disaster. Gas-guzzler: Carrying natural gas in huge plastic bags is a common scene in some villages in Shandong . Penny-pinching: Local media suggest this is a way for villages to save money on the transportation of gas . This reckless behaviour has been reported on as early as May 2011 in Zibo city in Shandong. It has since spread to different parts of the province. Netizens and media suggest this is a way for the locals to save money on transportation. Some suggest they are actually stealing gas. An earlier undercover investigation by Anhui Satellite TV Station shows that villagers in Zibo have little understanding of the dangers, claiming it to be safe. Unaware of danger: Previous investigation discovered that residents had little understanding of the hazards . The news clip documented villagers and even school pupils stealing gas from a large roadside container. Their plastic bags were inflated within minutes, and they carried them off before someone else came along to do the same. Villagers told the undercover reporter transporting gas this way isn't dangerous at all. Questions are now being raised within China about why the authorities have taken no steps to ban this practise after all these years. Unprotected: The gas bags are sealed in a basic manner. Passers-by worry they could spell disaster any time .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Bernie Sanders, my Vermont senator and, indeed, a friend of many years, is now running for president.  He noted at his announcement (with a familiar note of wise irony):  \"People should not underestimate me.\" To most Americans, of course, Sen. Bernie Sanders is only a name, if that.  He is barely known to the general public, which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation. Those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left-wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the Senate, as we did in 2006.  Let me add this, as someone who has followed him closely (and with admiration) for a long time:  When people stop to listen to Bernie, they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is, without a question, an authentic voice who speaks without fear. And nobody should underestimate him. I remember when Bernie was mayor of Burlington; it is the largest city in Vermont (which isn't saying much).  I met him then, and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before.  He spoke with a throaty Brooklyn accent, and he was Jewish -- not your typical Vermonter. He served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of Lake Champlain with remarkable energy for many years, listening closely to what people had to say, learning about politics at the local level, making a real difference in the daily lives of hard-working people. He was never a Democrat -- and isn't yet.  He's a progressive, holding his seat in the U.S. Senate as an independent, although he votes with the Democrats on major issues. When Bernie decided to run for Jim Jeffords' seat in the House of Representatives in 1988, many considered him a long shot.  I remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse, where Bernie held the floor for almost two hours, answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce, funny, entertaining, passionate voice.  Bernie won that seat, again and again. Make no mistake about this:  Vermont isn't just a rainbow-colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets.  It's an agricultural economy, and Bernie has understood this well.  He has thoughtfully supported Vermont's dairy-farming community over many years.  He has also been a strong supporter of Vermont's hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left, who wonder why the NRA doesn't attack him. I was never prouder of Bernie than during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.  He was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the House, strongly opposing the 2003 invasion.  He saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in American history, one with endless repercussions. He was especially outraged by the outing of former CIA spy Valerie Plame in 2006 by an official from the Pentagon, and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the Iraq War in the first place. This was typical of Bernie: The clear voice in the midst of the crowd, the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly. So what would it look like if, by some bizarre chance, Bernie caught fire and became President? He would certainly work hard for universal health care, which has been a passion of his.  I've heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single-payer system -- that has worked well throughout Europe for decades, reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well. He would not be Wall Street's best friend.  Indeed, he didn't support President George W. Bush in his efforts to bail out the bankers, and wrote an open letter to Henry Paulson, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, protesting that bailout.  Famously, on December 10, 2010, he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate opposing the reinstatement of Bush-era tax cuts, a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand Bernie's views. He is a socialist, of course.  How many American politicians have ever said this aloud?   And what does he really mean by that term? Bernie knows what he's doing.  By proclaiming himself a socialist, he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks, many with international bases, have controlled American public policy for a very long time, usually to the detriment of working people. And it's working people who seem mostly to interest Bernie Sanders.  He has been one of only a few voices in the Senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right-wing factions funded by \"millionaires and billionaires\" (one of Bernie's favorite mantras) have held sway over American politics for as long as anyone can recall. And this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads, serve meals, deliver the mail, drive trucks and teach in schools. As president, Bernie would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change.   Indeed, Bernie co-sponsored with Barbara Boxer the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007.   He has, for years, been a tireless advocate for the environment, aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad. But does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the Democratic nomination?  And if he won it, could he defeat a Republican candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal? He's not crazy.  In fact, he's probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes.  But he can't win, and he knows that.  What he will do, however, is move Hillary Clinton on matters of importance to progressives: The restraining of Wall Street and large corporations, the scandal of how America allows its political campaigns to be funded  and the welfare of working class Americans, who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests. A steep climb looms before him.  But I applaud Bernie Sanders.  I hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard.",

The women, who worked at the dementia unit of the Bupa-run facility, in Bretton, Cambridgeshire, told one woman she was going to be killed. Another confused patient was told she was living in a brothel and should expect male visitors. Chloe Pearsall, 26, (left) and\u00a0Nicole Howley, 25 (right) committed the acts of abuse at the care home throughout 2013 they have been jailed along with their colleagues\u00a0Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63 . All four workers \u2018systematically\u2019 abused residents until a whistleblower reported them to bosses. Nicole Howley, 25, was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of two charges of ill-treating a person as a carer under the Mental Capacity Act. Colleagues Chloe Pearsall, 26, Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63, were convicted of one count of the same offence and sentenced to nine months each. Sentencing the women, Judge Sean Enright said he had \u2018put aside his own personal revulsion\u2019 to find a \u2018just, proportionate sentence\u2019. Using the word \u2018fugly\u2019 demonstrated the \u2018lack of respect\u2019 they showed patients, he added, saying: \u2018This was systematic ill-treatment.\u2019 The case highlights the plight of many old and vulnerable people in the care system and hospitals. The Daily Mail has repeatedly called for improved standards under its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people. During a trial at Peterborough Magistrates Court earlier this year, co-worker Lanya Edwards described how the women, all from Peterborough, abused one resident with \u2018quite advanced\u2019 dementia. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire (pictured) has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people . The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013 and told one elderly resident that she was working in a brothel . \u2018She would ask where she was a lot. I would say she was in a care home in Peterborough and she would be staying here until she got better,\u2019 she said. \u2018But I heard some care assistants tell her she was living in a brothel. She used to get quite worried. It is not a nice thing to hear.\u2019 Miss Edwards said she heard Fisher, Holcroft and Howley taunting the women \u2018at least a couple of times a week\u2019. She also said she heard the women calling people \u2018fugly\u2019 behind their backs \u2013 although another witness, Jessica Skelly, told the court they used the term openly with at least one resident. \u2018It was used to her. She used to get distressed and said she would phone the police,\u2019 she said. Describing the vile abuse meted out to the woman who was told she was working in a brothel, she added: \u2018Chloe, Jo and Nicole all referred to her as a prostitute\u2026 they said she wasn\u2019t pulling her weight.\u2019 Three of the workers regularly referred to one resident as a prostitute and told another she was fugly . After the group were found guilty, magistrates decided to send the case to Peterborough Crown Court for sentencing because their sentencing powers were insufficient to reflect the \u2018gravitas of the offences and the vulnerability of the victims\u2019. Andrew Hurst, representing the women on Wednesday, said they continued to deny the offences. They were all dismissed from their jobs in February last year. A spokesman for the care home said: \u2018Everyone at the home is deeply shocked by the deplorable behaviour of these experienced carers.\u2019 A fifth carer, Benjamin Appiah, denies ill-treating three women and will stand trial in June.",

The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted.

Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria\u2019s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Juli\u00e1n Cuesta in the visitors\u2019 goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Bar\u00e7a number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria\u2019s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi\u2019s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta\u2019s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta\u2019s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Bar\u00e7a and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo\u2019s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta\u2019s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Brazil full-back Dani Alves rushes to congratulate team-mate Messi after he gives Barcelona a first half lead . The Argentina phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far . Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria\u2019s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona\u2019s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona\u2019s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury. If they don\u2019t do you with the magic of Messi and Suarez then they do you from a dead ball. Almeria had succumbed to all three threats.

Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother  had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of\u00a0cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even travelled to Japan when the 11th Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe. Lisa Courtney searches for Pokemon items online at her home . Lisa Courtney owns the world's largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia . 'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life. For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme helped her through a very difficult stage of her life . 'I started collecting when I was getting bullied at school, Pokemon was the only thing that made me feel happy.' Sharon Courtney said she did not mind moving to a smaller bedroom as Pokemon was so important to her daughter. 'I love Pokemon now. It helped Lisa through horrific times when she was at school and was kicked in the head and the back. 'Every time she came home and was tearful she would go to Pokemon and she would be smiling. 'She would love to work in Japan at the Pokemon Centre - more than winning the lottery - that would be her dream!' Lisa appears on Collectaholics on BBC2 at 7pm last night . Lisa spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales  hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive,' she added. Despite trying to save money where she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. I bought mine for \u00a360 online. 'I will always collect Pokemon, here's always something new to get. 'For me, Pokemon is like an additional family - it always lifts my spirits.' Watch Collectaholics on BBC iPlayer .",

His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. \"It seems he survived by sheer willpower,\" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. \"I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,\" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? \"I was just lying down,\" she said. \"There was no room to move here and there.\" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Moni Basu, Manesh Shrestha, Ivan Watson, Tim Hume and Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report.",

The Chiefs outscored their opponents six tries to one at Sandy Park, with a David Ewers score and a penalty try helping the home side into a 17-6 half-time lead. Exeter then added further tries through Thomas Waldrom, Byron McGuigan, Sam Hill and Dean Mumm after the break, with outclassed Newcastle only able to respond with a 68th-minute effort from Chris Harris and eight points from the boot of Tom Catterick. Carl Rimmer of Exeter Chiefs is tackled by Newcastle Falcons' Dom Barrow during match at Sandy Park . Exeter's Thomas Waldrom stretches over for a try during the European Rugby Challenge Cup match . The victory means Exeter will take on Gloucester at Kingsholm in two weeks' time for a place in the final against either Newport Gwent Dragons or the winner of Sunday's London Irish-Edinburgh encounter. The hosts made a number of changes from the side that lost 25-18 at Leicester in the Premiership last weekend with McGuigan, Ben Moon, Tomas Francis and Tom James being drafted in. The Chiefs were also forced into a late change with Damian Welch pulling-up in the warm-up so Ben White was promoted from the bench to play in the back row, skipper Mumm moved into the second row and Sam Skinner added to the replacements. Newcastle, who lost 46-17 to Exeter in the Premiership last month, started with two changes in the backs from the side that narrowly lost at London Irish with Juan Pablo Socino in the centre and Harris on the right wing. Both defences were tested in the opening 10 minutes but it was Exeter who made the first breakthrough just before the quarter-hour. Dave Ewers of Exeter Chiefs (centre) makes a break during his side's 48-13 victory against the Falcons . After the Falcons were forced to touch down over their own line, Exeter broke off the back of the five-metre scrum and Ewers barged over the line. Slade added the extras from out wide on the right and the Chiefs were under way. Exeter increased their advantage midway through the half when wing Matt Jess, who was on course to score from a loose ball, was pulled back twice off the ball by full-back Alex Tait. Referee Marius Mitrea had no hesitation in awarding a penalty try - which Slade converted - and Tait went to the sin-bin. Newcastle kept the Chiefs at bay while they were a man down and when they were back to full strength the visitors were awarded a penalty 12 metres out in front of the posts, which fly-half Catterick slotted over to get his side off the mark. Slade and Catterick then swapped penalties to leave Exeter with an 11-point lead at the interval. Dan Temm of Newcastle Falcons tackles Thomas Waldrom during the quarter-final encounter . That soon became 18 points as just 45 seconds after the restart Ewers broke from inside his own half, shrugged off a couple of half tackles, before offloading to number eight Waldrom to stretch for the line. Slade converted and, 12 minutes later, added his second penalty from 30 metres out to make it 27-6. The Chiefs' fourth try came just before the hour-mark when Will Chudley chipped over the head of the defence and into the arms of McGuigan to go over, with Slade again adding the conversion. The Falcons may have looked down and out but Harris rounded a couple of forwards to score a breakaway try under the posts with Catterick converting to cut the deficit to 34-13. However, the Chiefs replied immediately through Hill to help restore their advantage and then Hill turned provider for Mumm to score the Chiefs' sixth and final try, with replacement fly-half Gareth Steenson converting both to cap a one-sided triumph.",

Remembered: Pooch Mavis was reportedly attacked and consumed by an alligator earlier this month . Missed: Mavis was reportedly close to the park's boat launch at the time of the alligator's attack . The alligator involved in the attack is being looked for by wildlife officials, WWLP reported. According to the television station, Mavis was from Mobile's Midtown section and viewed as a 'neighborhood dog.' Local resident Nicole Lavirriere told the television station 'Mavis was a lot like my dog.' 'I think she's like the Norm of \"Cheers,\" she was the - you know, Mavis - everybody knew her name,' she told WWLP, laughing. She also told the news station 'She had regular houses that she went to get treats from. 'She knew how to pretty much open up our back door and come in when she wanted to.'

Lavirriere was filmed holding a young girl crying, and told her 'Stop, you're going to make me cry.' Arlington Park attendee Jayme Corry said in an interview with WWLP 'We see small [alligators], maybe two or three foot.' 'It definitely makes me scared,' he said.

On its website, the University of Florida warns 'It's very important to keep children and pets away from the water's edge wherever alligators are likely to be present. Do not allow dogs to swim or explore waters that are known to have alligators because dogs look like prey to alligators.'",

An Arizona police chief has voiced his support for his officer after dashcam footage emerged of him mounting a sidewalk in his speeding police car and knocking down an armed suspect. Video of the February 19 incident emerged on Tuesday and shows a cop car running into a suspect walking down a street in Marana, northwest of Tucon, with a rifle. Local police chief Terry Rozema spoke out on Wednesday to defend his officer and argue that deadly force was necessary. Speaking to CNN, Rozema was asked if Officer Michael Rapiejko was fortunate not to kill suspect Mario Valencia, 36. 'That very well may be... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,' Rozema said. 'So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,' the chief added. The footage has further stirred debate about the type of force it is appropiate for police to use. This latest incident following cell phone footage earlier this month capturing South Carolina police officer Michael Slager fatally shotting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away. In this latest video, Valencia is captured walking along a street in Marana, carrying what appears to be a rifle. He points the loaded weapon into the air and a shot rings out. WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGE . Scroll down for videos . Deliberate act: Valencia (pictured, left, in his mug shot) remained in hospital for two days before being booked into jail. Police have since spoken out in defense of Rapiejko's actions in the town of Marana, Arizona . Target: The police officer in the other vehicle warns  Rapiejko that the suspect is loaded and tells him to 'stand off'. But in apparent defiance of his advice, Rapiejo drives straight toward unsuspecting Valencia (pictured) Horrific: Seconds later, Rapiejo's vehicle mounts the curb (pictured) and smashes into the suspect's body . Hit: In this screen grab, from the dashcam video, Valenica appears to turn toward the car as it strikes him . A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' At the end of the footage, obtained by KOLD, Rapiejko is captured emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia, while other cops exit their own cars with their guns raised. Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. He was eventually booked into jail two days later. Pozema argued that Rapiejko may actually have saved Valencia's life because we don't know what he would have done next. Smash: Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall (pictured) before coming to a halt amid debris. The other cop can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down' High-speed: Bits of concrete can be seen sailing through the sky as Rapiejko's patrol car continues traveling . 'We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,' Rozema said. 'And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' ' In February, Sergeant Chris Warren also appeared to support the deliberate crash, telling KOLD that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at Columbus Avenue and 29th Street, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. Cracked: Valencia, was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in a serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. Above, Rapiejko's car window appears to be cracked . It culminated in the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart at 8280 North Cortaro Road. From there, the suspect fled to 5650 West Coca Cola Place, where he was struck and injured by Rapiejko's vehicle. 'He'd just stolen a weapon, loaded it, was not obeying commands from officers and walking toward occupied businesses. It's a busy time of morning, a lot of employees at work,' said Sgt Warren. 'We had to take immediate action and make sure he didn't get inside those businesses.' Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, because it was considered use of force. However, the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing and he is back on the force, Sgt Warren said. Valencia, meanwhile, is facing several felony charges for his 'spree'. Valencia had already been approached by police near a post office following the alleged Walmart theft, it is reported. There, he had apparently threatened suicide, before firing the gun and fleeing. Another view: Despite the shocking footage of the crash, Marana Police Chief Terry Rozema has defended Officer Rapiejko's actions. Above, this dashcam video was taken from inside the other officer's car . Swerving: The second video shows Rapiejko's car swerving across the road and heading toward Valencia . Life-saving? The vehicle smashes into the suspect (the black shape in the air, between the tree and the car) Apprehended: At the end of the footage, obtained by CBS affiliate KOLD-TV, Rapiejko can be seen emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia (under the tree), while other cops emerge with their guns raised .",

It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal . India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work. Nepal will need India's friendship -- as well as China's -- for many long months ahead.",

Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, befriended girls  and then \u2018hooked\u2019 them with alcohol - normally vodka - in an attempt to make them \u2018compliant\u2019 to sexual advances. The 43-year-old married businessman, who lived in the city with his wife and children, would pursue his interest \u2018away from his home and family\u2019, using his restaurant as a \u2018focal point\u2019. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls . Khubaib - who was convicted of the charges against him by a jury at the Old Bailey in five hours - had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls, the trial heard. The father of five groomed vulnerable under-age girls by giving them money, gifts or cigarettes before plying them with alcohol. Following a trial he was found guilty of forcing a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him and nine counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation involving girls aged from 12 to 15 between November 2010 and January 2013. His South African friend Manase Motaung, 32, was cleared of raping a 16-year-old and seven trafficking charges, involving six girls. Khubaib's conviction brings the total number of people to be convicted under Operation Erle to ten, of which five are of Pakistani origin. Khubaib was remanded in custody and warned he faces a long spell behind bars when he is sentenced on May 15. Eatery: Khubaib, who lived in Peterborough with his wife and children, would pursue his interest 'away from his home and family', using his restaurant (above) as a 'focal point' Judge Peter Rook QC told him he had been convicted 'of a very serious offence of a rape on a young girl... having plied her with vodka'. He added:\u00a0\u2018You have also been convicted of no less than nine trafficking offences in relation to under-age girls who you were deliberately plying with vodka so that you could take advantage of them, knowing they craved vodka so you could exploit them sexually. The Cambridgeshire Police investigation codenamed Operation Erle has led to a string of convictions for sex offences against girls in the Peterborough area. \u2018You must know the only sentence is a custodial sentence - and a long sentence.\u2019 The jury was deliberating for less than a day before it reached its verdicts. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls, from Peterborough, with a couple from Lincolnshire and Rutland. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the girls were vulnerable because of their age, background, circumstances or unsettled schooling and Khubaib pretended to be their \u2018friend and helper\u2019. Khubaib, who also ran a lettings agency, would drive girls to flats in his 4x4 and, once there, they would be groomed for sex by being \u2018plied with alcohol and entertained by himself and his friends\u2019. Khubaib raped a 14-year-old girl in August 2007 by forcing her to perform oral sex on him after she was given alcohol and then \u2018rewarded\u2019 with \u00a35, the court heard. The jury heard details of the trafficking allegations. Khubaib would buy one girl and her friends McDonald's meals and tobacco, as well as giving her small sums of money and a \u00a340 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday, the court heard. He told the girl he wanted her to be his wife, saying that he would \u2018choose her over everyone else\u2019, while he told another 15-year-old she had beautiful eyes, the jury was told. When she rebuffed him, saying he was too old for her, he was said to have replied: \u2018Age doesn't matter.\u2019 Khubaib allegedly offered another girl \u00a360, telling her: \u2018You make me happy, I'll give you money.\u2019 Two weeks later he allegedly increased the offer to \u00a390. The girl refused. In January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said. The girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away. Later that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14. Khubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped. Motaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a \u2018victim-led\u2019 inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. Nine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. Two years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12. Separately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. Wendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: \u2018What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.\u2019 The two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. Following the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: \u2018I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.\u2019 He added that the investigation was more than two years old, and \u2018I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved\u2019. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a \u2018victim-led\u2019 inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. A police spokesman said: \u2018We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. 'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.\u2019 A number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian/Pakistani men. Khubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then \u2018hooked\u2019 with alcohol in an attempt to make them \u2018compliant\u2019 to sexual advances . A mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter \u2018kick-started\u2019 the police investigation into Khubaib. The teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough. She saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police. Khubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard. The girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial \u2018worse than she expected\u2019 after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom. She said: \u2018We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying \"I'm stupid, I'm silly\". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls. \u2018Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that. \u2018There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.\u2019 The woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a \u2018big impact\u2019 on her daughter. She explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school. She said: \u2018After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'",

Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, launched a scathing attack on current title-holder Indianara Carvalho, claiming the model had 'revealed  who she truly is'. Miss Carvalho, 23, posted the racy picture to her Instagram account on Good Friday - the day the country's 130million Catholics solemnly remembered the crucifixion and death of Christ. Scroll down for video . Racy:\u00a0Indianara Carvalho posted the picture of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary on Good Friday . Slammed: Claudia Alende, who came second in the competition, launched a scathing attack on Miss Carvalho . The image, one of a series of nude shots she shared over the Easter weekend, was accompanied with a prayer which including the words: 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength'. But the paintings - created by Brazilian spray-paint artist Binho over 10 hours - prompted a tirade of disapproval from her followers, many of whom accused the Miss BumBum winner of disrespect and religious sacrilege. Ms Alende, the competition's vice champion,  better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', today waded into the furore, claiming she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqu\u00e9 Easter stunt. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Ms Alende, a Catholic, claimed she had also been asked to do the photoshoot but refused 'out of respect for God and for my family'. She said: 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her.' Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, is known as the Brazilian Megan Fox . Ms Alende, better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', claims she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqu\u00e9 Easter stunt . Ms Alende said: 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is' 'Our Lady is a holy figure, and for many the most important figure in their lives,' she added. 'To paint her across your naked body, especially on Good Friday, shows a breathtaking lack of respect and judgement. 'Like most other people, I was shocked when I saw the photos. I was actually embarrassed for her, even though she has no shame herself. 'I think in her head she doesn't care if it makes people talk well or talk badly of her. She just wants people to talk about her. She thinks that any kind of publicity is a good thing. 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is.' Brazilian beauty: Ms Alende claims Miss Carvalho has 'revealed who she truly is' by posting the naked shots . Ms Alende believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her rival . The Miss BumBum runner-up told MailOnline 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her' Ms Alende said the current Miss BumBum - who had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time again with 'someone special' - never deserved to win the coveted title last November. She said: 'I honestly have no idea how she won. She is too muscly, it means her body is ugly, she certainly doesn't represent the Brazilian woman.' And she believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her. 'She has made people see her in a negative way, so many are losing respect for her and interest in her too,' Ms Alende added. 'She is losing her credibility, and will lose work too. 'I think anyone who was shocked by her lack of respect for Christianity and the Virgin Mary should boycott her, including magazines and companies that might have used her image on their pages or to sell their products.'

Following the publication of the photos at the weekend, many of Miss Carvalho's Instagram followers expressed their outrage.

Another, Cadmo Barrera Lerma ranted: 'You have lost my total respect, at least one in your list of followers.' Janvier Veliz Angulo added: 'This proves that beauty is not everything\u2026 you have lost me as one of your fans.' Referring to Miss Carvalho's accompanying prayer, another user fumed: 'I think that to ask for peace and love and protection there is no need to be naked!!!! Please respect things related to God!' Happy Easter: This was another of the raunchy photographs posted on social media by the Miss BumBum winner . Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth'' The 2014 contest was marred by scandal after it was alleged that Miss Carvalho had bribed the judges with over \u00a370,000 in cash to make sure she won .

The official number was issued to Hernandez as he started the rest of his life in jail, at Cedar Junction state prison in Massachusetts. He was being moved to the maximum security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center near Shirley today. Hernandez is being held separately from other prisoners and is on suicide watch. He is now equipped with green prison scrubs and his tattoos are being examined for gang affiliations. It can also be disclosed that he was hooked on 'angel dust', a drug known to cause users to experience violent outbursts and paranoia. The former New England Patriots star smoked the hallucination-inducing drug in marijuana cigarettes that are known as 'killer joints' in the world of drugs. Sources said the brute, found guilty of murdering Odin Lloyd, was using the dangerous drug for at least a year before the victim was shot dead. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Junction prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left).He will no longer be No 81 having been given his prison number: W106228. A man who knew Hernandez and asked not to be identified, said: 'He was regularly high or out of his mind on Angel Dust. 'People who were in his circles knew about it and we would talk about how it turned him into a punk. He was consistently aggressive, arrogant and unpleasant. 'His dope man would bring it to his house and he would roll it in with some weed and smoke it with his friends. 'He got so full of himself that he sometimes stopped caring if people saw him doing it and he would be told to go outside because restaurant owners were worried about their licenses. 'Some of my friends do security for high profile sports people and celebs and I was invited to a party by one. Hernandez was there and throwing his weight around. 'When I said 'Hi' to him, he looked me up and down like I was a piece of s***. 'He just ignored me like I shouldn't have been there. 'I guess he was a d**head before because all that fame and money went to his head. But the drugs made him turn out to be a monster. Few people liked him. They just went with everything to keep him under control.' Hernandez was a heavy drinker and would often down cocktails and champagne on nights out with his hangers on, picking up large bar bills and doing his best to impress women with his celebrity status. His jury heard that on the night of the murder he smoked marijuana and he was caught on camera dancing at a gas station while filling up his rental car after he smoked the drug . Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts . Moving day: Prison life is a far cry from Herandez cushy life in North Attleborough. He is being transferred to the Souza Baranowski maximum security prison near Shirley today, say sources . Maximum security: Aaron Hernandez will be held in maximum security in\u00a0the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Mass . Prisons: The yard at\u00a0the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center (left).\u00a0Hernandez began his sentence at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (right) He was careful not to be high or boozed up whenever he was required for training sessions or for Patriots' games. Angel dust is also known as PCP and is a white crystalline powder that can also be dissolved in alcoholic drinks. It is also available in a variety of tablets, capsules, and users snort the colored powders as well as insert them into reefers with hash or dope. Doctors say the effects are that users feel detached, distant, and estranged from their surroundings. They experience hallucinations, severe mood disorders, and amnesia and outbreaks of violent behavior. Experts say PCP is addictive and one of the long lasting effects can be that users become violent or suicidal. Angel dust has been called 'devil dust' by those who have seen the violent outbursts of users and the manner in which it transforms them. The US Department of Justice's Drug Enforcement Administration says Angel Dust normally sells on the streets in powder, crystal, tablet, capsule, and liquid forms frpm $5 a tablet to $300 per ounce. Officials said users also referred to as Supergrass, Boat, Tic Tac, Zoom and, Shermans . Shayanna Jenkins, the mother of his two-year-old daughter, told the Lloyd murder trial that Hernandez smoked drugs on a daily basis. Hernandez showed signs of the effects with his brooding behavior in the months leading up to the Lloyd murder and is also accused in another murder case. Hernandez is charged in a 2012 double killing in Boston, accused in the drive-by shooting of two men he felt disrespected him at a nightclub. Victim: Odin Lloyd, who was murdered by Aaron Hernandez, resulting in the New England Patriots star receiving a whole-life sentence . Former Pats player Hernandez can be seen displaying his hip-hop moves as his rental car fills with gas, earlier that evening he had ran up a $243 bar tab and smoked marijuana . Having a high feeling of self worth is a classic symptom developed by users of the deadly drug. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder in the second case. He is charged with murdering Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after an encounter at the nightclub called Cure. Daniel de Abreu is said to have accidentally bumped into the footballer at a nightclub, spilling Hernandez's drink. Hernandez told a friend he thought the man was 'trying' him, and surveillance video outside the club showed Hernandez pacing back and forth while his friend tried to calm him down. But he is accused of following them in a silver SUV and shooting them in their car at a stop light later that evening. The NFL waill now have to investigate how a heavy drug using sports star could have avoided rigorous testing designed to weed out drug cheats. They will have to consider whether the fallen star may have had a supply of masking agents which can be bought over the counter or he stayed clean long enough each summer to pass pre-season tests and then fell off the wagon without fear of being caught. Either finding will prompt calls for more rigorous testing of NFL players for illicit substances.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nGlasgow Warriors have confirmed that experienced duo Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start Friday night's Guinness PRO12 match with Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun. Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night . The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby . As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit . This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain . 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'",

A mother whose jilted lover sent revenge porn to her 18-year-old daughter has spoken of the 'absolute nightmare' her life became as he bombarded her with abusive messages. Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with messages over the internet, even threatening to post a sex video of her on her Facebook page. The terrified woman said her life became a living 'hell' when Cotterill, who was jailed last week, sent an explicit photo of her to her own daughter. 'It got so bad I considered suicide,' the mother said. 'If it hadn't have been for some great friends I would have gone through with it.' 'It wasn't nice for my daughter. It was my past - years ago. My kids didn't need to know about that. 'I was trying to move on with my life. It's part of my life I want to totally erase. 'I know I'm not blameless because I shouldn't have slept with him. It was a stupid, stupid thing to do, it was a drunken thing. But it made my life an absolute nightmare.' Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\u00a0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\u00a0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\u00a0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook accounts in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. The victim said: 'My life was made hell. I became depressed, anxious and scared to leave the house. Cotterill was jailed for 12 weeks and ordered to not contact woman again following a trial at Birmingham Magistrates' Court (pictured) 'He didn't know where I lived but I thought \"What if he finds out?\" It got me worried to go out, I was constantly looking over my shoulder. I became very depressed, and the fact that he was sending pictures to my daughter was the final straw. 'It was just constant. There was no let-up. He kept sending messages. Some people said \"Oh it's only messages\", but it consumes your life. 'They say you should delete your Facebook account but it's a way of keeping in touch with my friends and family, especially friends I don't get to see. I blocked him but each time he set up new profiles to get past it... There was no way he was going to stop.' She reported Cotterill to Facebook but the social media site did not take any action, the victim claims. Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with messages over the internet, including threatening to post a sex video of her on her Facebook page . Eventually the woman told the police about the messages, ending the abuse, but the court case was yet another ordeal. She gave evidence from behind a screen that was just a few yards away from Cotterill, who smirked as she spoke. 'I thought if I didn't go to court he could carry on doing it, so I got the courage from somewhere,' she said. 'I'm happy I did, but it was difficult. This has been going on since August 2013 so it's nice to be believed. 'It feels like a weight's been lifted and hopefully this will be the end of it.' 'I'm happy the police arrested him and brought him to justice. I hope this sends the message out that you can't do this kind of thing. 'I have no idea how I got through it. There was a point where I was going to give in until a very, very good friend of mine said \"You cannot let this man do this to you anymore\". She was very concerned about my health, my mental stability. 'The Government has made this sort of thing a criminal offence, and that is a good thing. 'But I think about young children and teenagers who are going through a similar nightmare, and it sickens me. There are people out there who are not strong enough to deal with it.' Cotterill, from Oldbury, West Midlands, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found\u00a0guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting\u00a0his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a\u00a0three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening\u00a0manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her,\u00a0you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to\u00a0the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get\u00a0to see the photos. 'You used the power you had over her by the knowledge of\u00a0those photos.'",

'My ego is a little bruised that I didn't get a finish and didn't put on my best performance but Im happy with the win.' Bisping did well to recover from being floored in the first round by a left hook to finish the session on top. Both men traded blows in the second before Dollaway successfully completed a takedown just before the bell. Dolloway throws a big left at Bisping's head as the Brit endures a much tougher night than he expected . Bisping got the decision after finishing the stronger of the pair and landing the more telling blows late on . It was Bisping who finished the stronger, however, preventing another takedown and landing the more telling blows in the final round. All three judges gave him the nod by a score of 29-28. Bisping also confirmed he would relish a UK return on July 18 in Glasgow. 'It's been too long since I fought in the UK so if there is space on the 'It's been too long since I fought in the UK so if there is space on the Glasgow card and someone in the top 10, put me on it,' he added.",

But one Australian woman is making her nose job so public, it even has its own hashtag. Rhiannon Langley, from Melbourne, is sharing every step of the journey with hundreds of thousands of strangers, who can follow along on her social media accounts on the hashtag created just for the event, #RhiannonGetsRhino. Scroll down for video . Sharing is caring: Rhiannon Langley is posting her cosmetic surgery experience on social media through pictures and videos . Influencer: The 24-year-old from Melbourne has 189,000 followers on Instagram . The 24-year-old hairdresser has an almost 200,000-strong following on Instagram alone, and is keeping each of them updated while she undergoes Rhinoplasty in Thailand. Miss Langley is currently in Bangkok recovering at a hotel post-surgery, but has remained active on her social media accounts, posting videos on Snapchat and sharing snaps on Instagram. She informed her followers of her impending surgery via the latter one week ago. 'I've always wanted this since I was a lot younger, and I decided why not, if it makes me happy and improves my self esteem then I'm doing it!' she wrote. 'Yes plastic surgery is a controversial thing to do but this is my life and it's something I've wanted to do for so long and especially before my wedding.' Post-op selfie: Langley is currently in a Bangkok hotel recovering from surgery, but has remained active on social media . Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia from her hotel in Bangkok, Miss Langley\u00a0explained her motivation for going public further. 'I have quite a big following on social media and I don't want to lie about it,' she said. 'I think people are more accepting of the decision if you own it. 'I've seen so many other girls on social media get things done and then try and hide it. 'I have been a bit scared about getting negative feedback,' Rhiannon added, revealing that she kept hitting 'refresh' on her phone to read the comments coming through after she posted the announcement on Instagram. A little off here, and here:\u00a0Rhiannon revealed to Daily Mail Australia that her makeover will not be a subtle one, with changes being made to the shape and length of her nose . Holiday with a side of hospital: Rhiannon's $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' package included a stay in a Phuket beach hotel . Bedside view: Langley has been updating her followers with hospital snaps and post-op video messages . 'They've all been really positive and supportive though. Obviously you get a few weird comments, but it's been a lot better than I expected.' She also revealed to DMA that the results of the surgery will be 'quite drastic,' with changes made to the shape and length of her nose. But the true results won't show for another six months, when post-surgery swelling has gone down completely. Miss Langley wanted to share her experience with her followers, having found no one in her friendship circle to turn to for guidance on what the surgery and recovery would be like. 'None of my friends have had nose jobs, so I was searching on the Internet and couldn't find anything useful,' she said. 'I'm owning my decision': Rhiannon says  that she decided to be honest rather than hiding it from her followers . 'So I decided to post about my experience, post photos, share how I feel, how I look, and what I've gone through.' Miss Langley is sharing videos and pictures day-by-day on her Snapchat and Instagram accounts respectively, and is planning blog posts as well as filming a video diary throughout her 'journey'. The trip to Thailand started out as a relaxing beach holiday for Langley and fianc\u00e9 Jody Abrahams, before the couple travelled to Bangkok for the surgery. Her sunny vacation snaps and videos have been replaced with confronting, raw glimpses of Langley in recovery, sporting a swollen face and bruised purple eyes. Nuptials: Langley says her Thailand medical tourism package holiday was financially motivated, as she cannot afford surgery in Australia with her upcoming wedding to fianc\u00e9 Jody (pictured) to pay for . Rhiannon says her motivation to take her surgery overseas was financially motivated. 'The price difference [between Australia and Thailand] is huge,' she told DMA. 'I'm getting married in a year, so I couldn't afford to have the surgery in Australia.' Her trip to Thailand is a $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' package with CosMediTour. The Medical Tourism Agency has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that while they have assisted the social media influencer with finding accommodation, Langley paid the full rate for her surgery package. The packages include four to five star accommodation and meals, as well as the full cost of hospitalisation and surgery. Dream: The hair dresser has wanted the nose correction since she was a teenager . 'Rhiannon had been considering Rhinoplasty for a long time and she approached CosMediTour after being referred from a friend who previously had surgery through CosMediTour. We are very happy to have her as a client,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Rhiannon has a loyal Instagram following and she wanted to Blog about her Rhinoplasty experience as it was something that she didn't want to hide. 'We use fully accredited hospitals with internationally trained and highly skilled Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and have CosMediTour personnel in all destinations. We create four and five star packages which include surgery, accommodation, transfers, meals and don't charge any additional agency fee for our services.' Langley said she has wanted nose correction surgery since she was a teen, and wanted it done before her wedding to Abrahams in 2016. 'He likes me as I am now, but he supports my decision and is here taking care of me,' Rhiannon said. And she wasn't put off by recent criticism of the industry following the death of Gold Coast woman,\u00a0Evita Nicole Sarmonikas, in Mexico after a reported buttock implants, or the story of\u00a0Courtney O'Keefe, from Perth, who contracted a life-threatening infection following breast enlargement surgery in Thailand. 'I have had a lot of friends use Cosmeditour for boob jobs and tummy tucks, and have seen such good results,' so I didn't hesitate for a second,' said Langley. Langley started her blog and Instagram accounts two years ago as a way to promote her home hairdressing business. Her following has grown to over 189,000, and the pretty brunette has capitalised on her popularity, launching a body oil business and working on a swimwear line.",

The Labour leader used a speech in Edinburgh to claim the Tory election campaign has descended into 'desperation and panic', as some polls put Labour ahead across the UK. But Mr Miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in Scotland, 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour, robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority. Scroll down for video . A poll of Scotlans shows 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour . There has been a surge in support for the SNP in the months since the independence referendum in September . In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. The new YouGov poll for The Times shows Labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007. The SNP is up three points to 49 per cent, a record high. Support for the Conservatives was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the Liberal Democrats was up one point at 4 per cent. The results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted'. 'The polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the SNP is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the NHS and public services is winning support across Scotland.' Ms Sturgeon has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7. However, the SNP leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for Scotland in return, meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SNP's plan 'will mean a \u00a37.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances' In a joint press conference, Mr Miliband was joined by his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . The SNP has proposed 'a modest increase in public spending' to end austerity and allow Scotland's health budget to rise by \u00a32 billion by 2020. 'Let us lift austerity and have spending increases in the next parliament that are fiscally responsible but allow us to spend more money on our vital public services like the health service,' she said. 'I am proposing an increase in spending in the health service across the UK that would see by the end of this decade an additional \u00a32 billion being spent on the NHS in Scotland. 'That's the choice we have at this election - continued austerity being proposed by the Tories and Labour, or an alternative to austerity, which is what the SNP is proposing, and we need a strong Scottish voice in Westminster that can force that alternative to austerity.' But in a joint press conference, Mr Miliband, his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP's plan 'will mean a \u00a37.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances'. Mr Miliband said: 'Today I challenge Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to say how they will fill this GBP7.6 billion gap. Which services will be cut? Which taxes will be raised? And what cuts will it mean for pensioners in Scotland when they are taken out of the UK pensions system? 'The SNP claim in this campaign to be proposing no reductions in spending, but in fact they are planning dramatic reductions in spending.\u00a0They must now come clean.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in Sterling today, has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7 . Ms Sturgeon joined with local candidate Steven Paterson while on the campaign trail in Stirling . The latest poll results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted' Mr Miliband pledged: 'I will never sell Scotland short by signing up to the SNP's plans. And I will never sell Britain short by abandoning the pooling and sharing of resources. Because this is a pooling and sharing which benefits all parts of our country, because we look after each other and we know we can only tackle the problems our country faces across the whole of the United Kingdom.' Speaking ahead of Mr Miliband's speech, Ms Sturgeon claimed that Labour was 'wrong' in its analysis. 'This is desperation on the part of the Labour Party,' the SNP leader said during a campaign visit to Stirling. 'Instead of putting forward a positive case of their own, they are resorting to the same fears and smears that they resorted to during the referendum. 'The truth is, the only cuts on the horizon for Scotland are the ones that the Tories are proposing and Labour are backing.'",

Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly told an Orange County jury that 20-year-old Kevin Jonas Rojano-Nieto 'did not intend to harm' the three-year-old girl he raped at his family home in June. The judge said that he was sure that although Rojano-Nieto sodomized the girl and covered her mouth so she couldn't scream out, 'there was no violence or callous disregard for the victim's well-being'. Controversial: Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly (seen here with a colleague in 2010) has handed a 10-year sentence to a 20-year-old child rapist. The mandatory sentence should be 25-years to life . Judge Kelly also said Rojano-Nieto, 'inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm the victim.' Prosecutor have said they will appeal the controversial decision and will be pushing for the minimum sentence of 25-years to life to be reinstated. Rojano-Nieto was found guilty on December 3 of raping the girl who wandered into a garage where he was playing video games. According to the court news service, Rojano-Nieto said he became aroused by the girl and pulled her pants down to rape her during the sickening attack. While this was going on, he could apparently hear her mother calling out for her, so covered her mouth so she couldn't scream back. The girl told her mother after the assault that she was in pain and her mother called the police who found injuries consistent with rape. Rapist: Kevin Jonas Rojano-Nieto has been sentenced to 10-years behind bars for the rape of a 3-year-old girl . \u201cAlthough serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child,\u201d Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly said according to KTLA. Deputy District Attorney Whitney Bokosky said she disagrees and will appeal. She said that Rojano-Nieto knew what he was doing was wrong because he covered the girl's mouth during the rape so she couldn't call out.",

A kestrel and a barn owl repeatedly lunged at each other while trying to gain mastery of the box so they could lay eggs and rear their young in safety. And despite the owl's cuddly reputation, it came out the victor, forcing the kestrel to seek an alternative home for itself and its mate. Face-off: A barn owl and a kestrel have been caught on camera fighting in a nesting box . Conflict: The two birds of prey lunged at each other in a vicious scrap . The fight was captured on video by wildlife photographer Robert Fuller, using a camera he set up inside a 13ft-high elm tree stump in his garden in Thixendale, North Yorkshire. He said that a pair of kestrels had been guarding the nesting box in the tree, but when they left in the evening a barn owl swooped in and laid a claim to the nest. After the owl drove the kestrels away he managed to attract a mate to share his new home - but the kestrels found an alternative nesting box in Mr Fuller's garden. The cameras were set up as part of an exhibition at Mr Fuller's gallery, monitoring the nest of blackbirds, blue tits and pheasants as well as birds of prey. Confrontation: The kestrel was attempting to win back the nesting box after guarding it all day . Flurry: A video camera captured the vicious fight, with the two birds throwing themselves at each other . On top: At one point the kestrel had the owl up against the wall of the box inside an old tree stump . Mr Fuller said: 'The nest has been used in the past by tawny owls and this year the kestrels were showing a lot of interest in it. 'The female was guarding it during the day then in the evening a male barn owl started coming in and calling for a mate. 'The kestrel and barn owl battle is absolutely spectacular footage. It's much more exciting than any soap or drama on TV. 'In the footage you can see the barn owl lands and the kestrel comes right behind and hits so hard it knocks it inside and into the nest wall. 'Both birds are very well equipped to kill things, they have very sharp talons. They often have disputes in the air but here they were in a very confined space. Turnaround: Despite the kestrel's more aggressive reputation, the barn owl ended up defeating it . Victor: At the end of the video the owl can be seen admiring its new home . 'At the beginning the barn owl was looking for an escape route but the male kestrel keeps appearing at the opening. 'Kestrels have a terrier mentality, they're aggressive. Barn owls aren't really but they do have very long legs and talons, it was a fairly even battle. 'The kestrels have been here since 2006 and I feed them in the garden, they're like part of the family. But the barn owl is my favourite bird and I wanted them to nest here too. I didn't want either of them to get injured. 'The barn owl won, he's found a mate now and the kestrels are in a different nesting box in my garden. The female is guarding it day and night, she's not going to get caught out again.' Barn owls and kestrels are both attracted to nests which overlook open land, meaning that it is fairly common for them to compete for the same nesting space.",

Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her \u00a33 million home. Beyonc\u00e9 went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyonc\u00e9 was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview \u2013 one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyonc\u00e9 is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyonc\u00e9's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record \u2013 it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below). We'll be donning Mango's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style. Mango Chiffon Ruffle Dress . Visit site . Boohoo Laura Curve Column Dress . Visit site . Bec & Bridge Isis Angle Dress (now on sale for $178!) at Revolve . Visit site . Carven Cr\u00eape de Chine Dress at Barneys . Visit site . So what did that amount to? Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity \u2013 what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful\u2026 it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible \u2013 I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story \u2013 we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'",

When you're exploring the fields at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro, Arkansas, the odds are higher than usual. \"Are you going to bless me and let me find a diamond today?\" That was Susie Clark's prayer on April 23, according to the state park service. Soon after, Clark, who is from Evening Shade, Arkansas, saw a 3.69-carat white, teardrop-shaped diamond in the plowed field. Inspired by her prayer, Clark named it the Hallelujah Diamond. She plans to keep it. The diamond, which is the largest found at the park so far this year, is about the size of a pinto bean, says park interpreter Waymon Cox. \"And it's the largest one found since April 16, 2014, when a 6.19-carat white diamond, named the Limitless Diamond, was found at the park,\" he said, according to a park press release. It's the 122nd diamond found at Crater of Diamonds this year. Visitors get to keep what they find at the state park's 37.5-acre search field, which is named for an ancient eruption that scattered the area with gems. The area, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- anyone can dig for diamonds and keep them. It's not clear how much the diamond is worth, and park officials aren't trained to appraise them, according to the park website. But Oklahoman Tara Clymer sold a 3.85-carat diamond she found at the park last year for $20,000. 50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders . Park staff regularly plow the area to bring more diamonds to the surface for visitors to discover. The 40.23-carat Uncle Sam, the nation's largest diamond, was found in 1924, and the \"perfect\" 3.03-carat Strawn-Wagner diamond was found in 1990. The Strawn-Wagner Diamond was cut in 1997 by the renowned diamond firm Lazare Kaplan International of New York. The now 1.09-carat diamond is on display at the park visitor center. The park stretches for more than 900 acres along the Little Missouri River, but the diamond field is the main attraction. More than 75,000 diamonds have been discovered there since farmer John Huddleston discovered gems on what was then his property in 1906.",

A Romanian woman who believed she was pregnant was devastated to be told she actually had an 11lb tumour inside her uterus. Madalina Neagu, 42, arrived at a hospital in with severe pain in her abdomen and told doctors she believed she was in labour. As a result, medics at Botosani County Hospital prepared to operate to deliver the child. But after carrying out tests, they were shocked to discover she wasn't pregnant at all. Instead, she was actually carrying a 11lbs (5kg) tumour inside her uterus. One of the doctors treating her, Dr Dorin Scladan, 47, said: 'As the woman told us she was pregnant, we initially expected pregnancy complications. 'In fact, the size of her belly was quite similar to that of a nine-month pregnant woman, so we didn't have any reason to doubt what she told us.' Dr Sclandan and his colleage Dr Camelia Todica, 43, carried out an operation to remove the tumour. The patient was then transferred to intensive care - and doctors say she will recover. Dr Scladan said: 'We don't often see a tumour of this size and in this location.' The news comes after last year MailOnline reported on the story of Lorna Fulton, 44, who desperately wanted a family and believed she was pregnant when her stomach began to swell. She had ballooned to a size 26 and her waistline had been expanding despite months of dieting. But while she hoped this was a sign she was expecting, specialists discovered a huge ovarian cyst. Mrs Fulton was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach. It was revealed she had been carrying around a 5st cyst, a sac of fluid that forms on the ovary, for months. She recovered after the operation, and although she now cannot have children, says she feels 'lucky to be alive'. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to remove the tumour from the woman's uterus, and she was transferred to intensive care . And in 2012, MailOnline reported on the story of Kayleigh Terry, 21, who believed she was pregnant with her first child after gaining weight. But she was terrified to discover she actually had cancer. An ultrasound scan revealed she had a large cancerous growth which covered an area from her breast to her lower abdomen. She was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma and had emergency chemotherapy to shrink the potentially deadly tumour. Miss Terry lost her hair and eye-lashes along with 3st in weight after the shrunken tumour was removed a few months later. But after treatment, she was given the all clear, and now hopes to start her own family.",

The families of two teenage girls killed by a train at a level crossing have been shut out of a meeting where they planned to challenge Network Rail bosses over their bonuses and passenger safety. Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, died when an express train hit them at Elsenham station, Essex, in December 2005 as they set off on a Christmas shopping trip. The friends had been using the station\u2019s unlocked footpath crossing to catch a service to Cambridge when they were struck by a through train bound for Stansted Airport. An inquest returned verdicts of accidental death \u2013 but it later emerged that crucial safety reports had not been disclosed to the coroner, leading to allegations of a cover-up. Network Rail was subsequently convicted of criminal negligence and fined \u00a31 million over the deaths. However, campaigners say too many dangerous crossings still exist in rural areas \u2013 despite a Network Rail closure programme \u2013 and that \u2018excessive\u2019 bonus payments to executives totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds are not justified. The girls\u2019 parents had planned to raise their concerns at a meeting in London last week organised by Network Rail\u2019s Public Members, a watchdog whose role is to hold the taxpayer-funded body to account. However, their request to attend was turned down. Last night the girls\u2019 fathers, Chris Bazlinton and Reg Thompson, said in a statement: \u2018Bonus payments were made to Network Rail executives even after failures in regard to safety at level crossings, resulting in many deaths, including those of our daughters. \u2018We had hoped that Members would challenge Network Rail on these issues and ensure action to improve safety at level crossings is speeded up. The Network Rail governance structure is seriously flawed and not fit for purpose.\u2019 Network Rail, which receives a \u00a34 million annual subsidy from the taxpayer, does not have shareholders. Instead, its activities are scrutinised by a panel of about 30 individuals, appointed by independent assessors for three-year terms. Fatal accident site:\u00a0Olivia Bazlinton, 13, and Charlotte Thompson, 14, were fatally struck\u00a0Elsenham station, Essex, in December 2005 . Last year, chief executive Sir David Higgins, who has since left the company, saw his basic \u00a3591,425 salary boosted by a \u00a367,919 bonus, while network operations chief Robin Gisby, who has also left, received a \u00a347,641 bonus on top of his \u00a3380,275 salary. In total, the firm\u2019s bosses received \u00a3250,000 in bonuses last year. A Network Rail spokesman said: \u2018The tragedy at Elsenham was a watershed for this company and the way it approaches safety at level crossings, and members of the families have played a pivotal role in this. As a result\u2026 level crossings in Britain are among the safest in Europe, but there is still much that can, and will be done to make them safer still.\u2019 David Porter, co-ordinator of the Public Members, said: \u2018The decision not to invite the families to the workshop was\u2026 in no way influenced by Network Rail. The Members are independent but their role is limited and they are not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.\u2019",

The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open. Rafa Nadal practices in Barcelona as he steps up his clay-court preparation ahead of the French Open . Nadal was beaten convincingly by Novak Djokovic in MOnet Carlo last week . But as far as Nadal is concerned, 2015 is no different to 2013, 2012 or even 2011. 'Djokovic was good in 2011, in 2012, 2013 as well as in 2015. Sometimes you win more and some you win less,' Nadal, who has triumphed at the French Open in nine of the last 10 years, told reporters at the Barcelona Open. 'It is difficult to win everything all the time. Djokovic was as good then in 2011 as he is now. He had an impeccable year in 2011 as well as he is having in 2015. I have to congratulate him. Djokovic is World No 1 and in superb form, but Nadal insists he has no worries about Roland Garros . The Spaniard is looking to win a sixth consecutive French Open, and a tenth in total . 'The rest of the players have to accept that at the moment he is the world number one with all he has achieved this year,' added Nadal, who has had a patchy year after making his comeback in January following another lengthy injury and illness break. 'This year I have to do things right, get back to a very high level to face him on the court,' Nadal said. 'Tennis-wise, I feel a lot better than a few weeks ago. I am going to try to get as far as I can and to play as well as I can, topping the level I showed in Monte Carlo.'

But Klitschko must first face the unbeaten Jennings in New York. \u2018I believe Wladimir will beat Jennings and I want him to win because I want to be the one to beat him in England and put an end to his reign,\u2019 said Fury. \u2018We\u2019ve been in discussions to get the fight on, hopefully at one of the big football stadiums in September. It\u2019s something which I\u2019ve left with my promoter and team and things are looking positive though it takes a very brave or stupid man to step in the ring with Tyson Fury. \u2018I\u2019m the heavyweight who is going to take over this division because I have everything that is needed. Wladimir has had a good run but it\u2019s time for a change because the heavyweight division needs an injection of new blood and I\u2019m ready to provide that.\u2019 Reigning heavyweight champion Klitschko shake hands with Jennings, left, \u00a0after the weigh-in . Klitschko has held a portion of the world title since 2000 but Fury is convinced he is the man to beat him. \u2018I\u2019m mandatory for the WBO title and if Wladimir does defend it against me he won\u2019t last more than eight rounds because I will be knocking him out after being involved in a bit of a brawl early on,\u2019 he added. \u2018I know his flaws and I know how to beat him \u2013 for once he will be picking on someone his own size. \u2018A fight with Wladimir doesn\u2019t concern me because I know I will beat him, it\u2019s just a matter of how and what round I do the job in. I\u2019m still not fully convinced he has the balls to step in the ring with me but if he does then I take my hat off to him because it will be the night the Klitschko era ends and the Tyson Fury one begins.\u2019 Former heavyweight champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis attend the official weigh-in .

Hazard scored Chelsea's 38th minute winner against Manchester United and is widely expected to be named PFA player of the year on Sunday. Mourinho said: 'He's a kid, but he knows that he is one of the three best players in the world - he is coping with that responsibility. Eden Hazard has been named 'one of the three best players in the world' by his manager Jose Mourinho . Hazard has been in superb form for Chelsea this season and scored the winner against Manchester United .

Mourinho has praised the Belgian's exceptional talent and also his unwavering humility amid his success . 'I had lots of stars. Hopefully in every club I worked I had stars. But he is the humble star, yes. He is the humble star. 'He's getting strong. Physically, mentally he's getting very, very strong. He understands his role. 'The day before the game I told him: 'This game we will never lose. Never.' 'But we needed to win. He understands clearly that especially in a moment where the team doesn't have all its power, he understands when the game becomes strategically. 'He understands that his talent is fundamental for the team. He was there for us and almost a second goal when he hit the post.' Hazard also believes he is having the best season of his career as Chelsea close in on the Barclays Premier League title. The Chelsea winger said: 'I'm playing my best season ever. With my experience, I succeed to manage the strong and weak moments in a game better. 'Last year I played a good season, but I disappeared in some games. 'This season I can't really remind a game where I really wasn't into. It's impossible to be top in 40 or 50 games in a season, but I've been the best player of the team for several times. 'My stats? People are talking more about me, but what pleases me the most, is that I'm doing better than last season.' Hazard, still only 24-years-old, is being hotly tipped to claim the PFA Player of the Year award this season .",

So what's her secret? The model has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body. In an interview with the Evening Standard, the  model admitted that the most surprising thing in her handbag is the tester kit, which she uses to check her state of alkaline. Scroll down for video . Elle Macpherson, who turned 51 last month, has revealed that she carries around a pH balance urine tester kit wherever she goes to check the state of her body . Elle said: '(The most surprising thing in my handbag is) a pH balance urine tester kit to check that I'm in an alkaline state. I believe that most ailments come from having an acidic body.' The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. An alkaline body can be achieved by eating the right foods (lots of leafy greens) and exercising. Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times, and the Britain's Next Top Model host puts her figure down to 'variation' and 'consistency'. The body's pH value tells you how acidic or alkaline your body is, and many nutritionists say that having an alkaline body helps defend against sickness and disease. Elle is well-known for her healthy diet and even released her own superfood product, The Super Elixir . She said: 'Variation is key. I work out 45 minutes a day, six days a week, combining hiking, water skiing, swimming and running on a beach. '(My idea of a healthy diet is) consistency and eating three healthy meals a day. Having said that, red meat, wheat and dairy don't work for me.' Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she's unveiled her very own brand. Last year, Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, which she describes as her drug. She hasn't aged a day! Having been labeled 'The Body' since the 1980s, Elle, pictured, left, in 1995 and, right, in 2012, \u00a0has had to make sure her physique is in peak condition at all times . The product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention. The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function. Speaking to FEMAIL at the time about the inspiration behind her new range, Elle said: 'I'm on the run a lot and if I'm not nourished, I don't feel good. 'For years, I was taking vitamins and powders. I tried alternative medicine, acupuncture, reflexology. 'I'm a pescatarian, I don't drink, do drugs or smoke so what else can I do? I wasn't unaware of wellness but something wasn't working for me and I told my doctor \"I don't feel great\". 'She told me my body was acidic, it was down to stress, travel and lack of sleep.' Elle has co-created The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein, which is made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao and a product that the supermodel credits for helping her get ready for beach holidays . So successful was the launch of the elixir that the duo have added another product to the range: The Super Elixir Nourishing Protein. Made from locally sourced organic sprouted brown rice, pea protein chocolate and Peruvian cacao, the \u00a345 product is a plant based complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids like those found in red meat, eggs, chicken and fish. 'Not only do I love the delicious chocolate taste but I enjoy sport and need a good source of clean protein for muscle repair, energy and of course getting ready for that beach holiday,' said Elle of the latest health product.",

Such was her exultation that Judy Murray, mother of tennis star Andy (who was widely criticised for voicing his support for Scottish independence on the eve of last year\u2019s independence referendum), tweeted about her triumph. Judy Murray said: \u2018GSM Sturgeon\u2019 (Game, Set and Match). Scroll down for video . The Britain-wide TV audience was clearly impressed - an instant poll by YouGov found that 28 per cent thought \u00a0Nicola Sturgeon was the best performer . For most people outside Scotland, this will have been their first proper view of Scotland\u2019s First Minister. Until now, she had been in the substantial shadow of her noisy and bullish predecessor, Alex Salmond. But few north of the border were surprised by her performance. The fact is that Sturgeon has the most experience of governing of any of the seven politicians taking part in the TV debate, having been a member of the Scottish Cabinet and Deputy First Minister since 2007. Such is the hero-worship she attracts in Scotland, that even after the SNP lost the referendum vote last year, 12,000 people paid to see her speak at Glasgow\u2019s Hydro, a concert venue more usually home to pop stars such as Sting or Rod Stewart. Sturgeon is a very canny operator. Her style on Thursday night was deliberately calm, natural and direct \u2013 qualities that are rare in politicians in this age of spin and slipperiness. The Britain-wide TV audience was clearly impressed. An instant poll by YouGov found that 28 per cent thought she was the best performer. Fascinatingly, one of the most-searched things on Google immediately after the end of the broadcast was whether people who don\u2019t live in Scotland can vote for the SNP on May 7. I found myself torn. As a fellow Scot, I wanted to see her do well. But as someone who regards himself as \u2018British\u2019 and who voted to keep the union, I am all too aware of her determination to destroy my country. Indeed, Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon is a very dangerous woman. Such was her exultation that Judy Murray, mother of tennis star Andy, tweeted about her triumph. Judy Murray said: \u2018GSM Sturgeon\u2019 (Game, Set and Match) Leader: For most people outside Scotland, this will have been their first proper view of Scotland\u2019s First Minister . Although poles apart politically \u2013 and Sturgeon herself would run the Royal Mile in Edinburgh at the comparison \u2013 she shares many similarities with Margaret Thatcher. Like Mrs T, the SNP leader transformed her image from that of a dowdy egghead into a glamorous, power-dressing imperatrix \u2013 emphasising a mixture of elegant feminine charm and steel. Her strength of character and willpower have driven her to the top of a party that has traditionally been dominated by powerful men in kilts. What has lifted her above these male rivals is her emotional intelligence. Although naturally shy, her two decades in politics has seen her grow into a polished public performer. Make no mistake, however: she is unequivocally left-wing. And she is also an avowed feminist. Indeed, during her SNP conference speech last month she said: \u2018I am determined that \u2013 unlike that other woman leader we once knew \u2013 I will use my time in this job to improve the lives of women across our country.\u2019 One of her first acts as First Minister was to create a gender-balanced Cabinet. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon greets young fans on the campaign trail in Edinburgh, where she was hailed as 'Scotland's Queen' Dangerous: SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon could hold the balance of power and be in position to decide who forms the next government . Having taken over from Alex Salmond after the SNP had lost the referendum, Sturgeon is in some ways exactly what Scotland needed. The country was \u2013 and still is \u2013 deeply divided and bruised by the vote. But the beguiling Sturgeon is a much more conciliatory and less arrogant figure than her predecessor. Very cleverly, she is now taking her Scottish independence campaign south of the border. And Thursday\u2019s TV debate offered the perfect platform. By saying that her \u2018message to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland is one of friendship\u2019, it was a brazen charm offensive. Opinion polls suggest that post-May 7, Sturgeon could wield huge influence over who forms the next government in Westminster. And with predictions that her SNP could take 45 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats, there is a growing fear in England that she could hold Westminster to ransom. Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . By propping up a Miliband government, she would try to impose her left-wing agenda: big-state socialism, ferocious opposition to an austerity programme, the non-renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent, demands for expensive public spending projects that fly in the face of economic reality. If that happens, Britain would face a political crisis as the English (who number 53million) would feel justified in rebelling against a government that depended for its existence on the votes of a neighbouring country of just five million. Such a situation would, inevitably, become unworkable and collapse, with incalculable consequences for our political system. Of course, that would play right into the hands of Nicola Sturgeon. For she full knows that the growing anti-Scottish feeling in England could lead to Westminster concluding that the union with Scotland was unsustainable. Already, Scots are speculating that there would soon be a second referendum on independence. These are the cards that Sturgeon holds \u2013 and her hand is stacked with aces. The fact is that she commands her party and her nation in a way that David Cameron or Ed Miliband can only dream of. Today, Nicola Sturgeon is the most dangerous woman in British politics.",

Taubman, a real estate developer who helped change the face of suburban life by popularizing upscale indoor shopping malls, died Friday at the age of 91. The announcement was made by his son, Robert Taubman, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Taubman Centers Inc., the company his father founded 65 years ago. A. Alfred Taubman -- his first name was Adolph -- was born January 31, 1924, in Michigan to German Jewish immigrants who hit hard times during the Great Depression. \"I started working when I was 9,\" he told an interviewer in 2007. \"I really wanted to make some money.\" An Army Air Force veteran of World War II, he studied architecture at the University of Michigan and Lawrence Institute of Technology near Detroit, and worked for an architectural firm, but decided that drawing wasn't the path to success. \"I wanted to build.\" In his autobiography, \"Threshold Resistance: The Extraordinary Career of a Luxury Retailing Pioneer,\" Taubman said that when he \"looked over the horizon, I saw that there was money to be made by people who could build and own stores or, better yet, groups of stores.\" He founded the Taubman Co. in 1950 and began to demonstrate what the company's website calls an \"ability to assess and overcome threshold resistance -- a phrase he coined to describe the psychological and physical barriers that keep a shopper from entering a store.\" As the post-war growth of suburbia continued, retail developers like Taubman began to consider what that might mean: More and more people needed places to shop. Taubman embarked on multi-store developments in the 1950s, in places like Flint and Taylor, Michigan, and in 1961 broke ground on his first large mall, the 350,000-square-foot Arborland project in Ann Arbor. \"Demographically, I looked at the numbers, and as far as I was concerned we couldn't miss,\" he recalled in 2007. \"And we didn't.\" Indeed not. This year, Forbes estimated his net worth at $3.1 billion, and the company's U.S. malls generate average annual sales of $809 per square foot, according to the company's website. But if Alfred Taubman gained fame and amassed billions as one of the people who helped define suburban life, he gained notoriety along the way, as well. In 1983, he bought the renowned international auction house Sotheby's. And in 2002 he was jailed following a conviction for conspiring with rival auction house Christie's to fix auction house commission rates to maximize profits. He was released in 2003 after having served nine months in prison. He always maintained his innocence, saying one of his underlings had lied about him to keep from going to prison herself. Taubman was renowned for his attention to detail, knowledge of design and for developing some of the best-known malls in the United States. He first project was a freestanding bridal shop in Detroit. Over more than six decades, his company operated nearly 20 properties in the continental U.S., including well-known developments such as the Beverly Center in Los Angeles, The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and The Shops at Crystals, in Las Vegas. His designs evolved over the years to include not only enclosed malls but various styles of open-air developments. And his influence stretched far from the American soil and into the thriving markets of China and South Korea. People we've lost in 2015 . Taubman remained active until the end of his life. He devoted much of his energy in his later years to philanthropic activities. And, just over three weeks before his death, he attended the grand opening of The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico with his sons Robert and William. According to a statement by Robert Taubman, the patriarch had dinner in his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, on Friday, then died of a heart attack. In addition to his sons, Robert and William, he is survived by a daughter, Gayle Taubman Kalisman, who is co-chair of the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute's advisory board, two stepchildren, and his second wife, Judith Mazor Rounick, a former Miss Israel. CNN's Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report.",

The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating. The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months. The actress and model shows off her natural beauty posing by the ocean in the summer shoot . The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and says she can't believe how successful they've been . The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash 'flicking' treatments . Michelle Keegan teased fashion fans with some items from her new Lipsy range on Tuesday, and has unveiled her designs in full today . As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Michelle revealed the regime that keeps her fit, healthy and glowing from the inside out. Sharing her top tanning tips for a flawless faux glow as she shows off her natural beauty in behind the scenes imagery, Michelle advised: 'Always exfoliate first and not just knees and elbows, all over your body. 'Next, I moisturise all over and then use Garnier Dry Body Mist all over my body, including the underside of my arms.' The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash treatments. LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months. Michelle, 27,\u00a0has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months to come . The designer's success shows no sign of abating as she unveils yet another stylish range . The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. The star, 27, seen in her Garnier Ambre Solaire campaign, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.'",

Richard Ilczyszyn, a leading financial broker, could be heard 'groaning' and 'crying' by staff on the Orange County-bound plane as it prepared to land. But rather than seeking medical help, the attendants allegedly left the father-of-three in the cubicle and, on landing, letting off all other passengers before calling paramedics. Distraught, Ilczyszyn's wife Kelly, who is a Southwest flight attendant, is filing a wrongful death suit against the airline for failing to act. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Distraught: Kelly Ilczyszyn claims her husband Richard (pictured together with their daughter Sydney) could have survived his heart attack on a Southwest flight if attendants sought medical attention rather than police . Tragic: The leading financial broker was 46 when he lost consciousness on the Orange County-bound flight . Defending their actions, a Southwest spokesman said staff are trained to treat such behavior - screaming and crying in the bathroom - as a security risk. A sheriff's report stated that Ilczyszyn's foot was wedged in the door as he 'groaned' and 'cried' at the end of the flight heading home to Orange County, California, after a business trip. Staff described him to colleagues as 'an unruly passenger,' records reveal. Kelly told\u00a0CBS News:\u00a0'He should have been helped on the aircraft. If they just would have gotten help. 'One flight attendant said she opened the door and she saw the top of my husband's head and his head was down and he was just whimpering, and [she] left him there. 'The paramedics should have met the aircraft. Absolutely. Absolutely. And he would be here today.' Baffled: Kelly, a Southwest flight attendant, said the sequence of events goes against what she would do . Father: She described the pain of having to tell their daughter Sydney that Richard had died . Justice? Kelly has filed a wrongful death suit against Southwest Airlines . As a flight attendant for the same airline, Kelly explained, the sequence of events baffled her. 'I know if a passenger is in distress... we need to help them,' she said. 'We need to figure out, is he okay, does he need medical attention, what's going on. And so I was very confused why they didn't help my husband.' Ilczyszyn's passing was mourned by the financial community. The founder of independent brokerage firm iiTrader, he spent 10 years as a floor trader in Chicago, and often appeared as a commentator on television. Beyond the lawsuit, Kelly said her focus is now on their young daughter Sydney. Breaking the news, she explained, was terrible. 'That was the worst. My daughter and her father were so close. I just said, \"Daddy's not coming home. Daddy went to heaven\".'",

That's the mayor's response to an artist's apology and offer to cover the cost of fixing the \"Scary Lucy\" statue that has put the New York town of Celoron in the spotlight this week. The bronze figure of comedian and area native Lucille Ball has elicited comparisons to a \"Walking Dead\" zombie and inspired the Facebook campaign \"We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue.\" The sculpture, a gift to the town from its original owners, has been on display since 2009. Artist Dave Poulin has \"had plenty of opportunity to step forward, and our last conversation he wanted $8,000 to $10,000,\" Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost said. \"And then he stated that if we didn't have the funds and we didn't like the statue, we should take it down and put it in storage.\" After the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend, Poulin publicly apologized Monday for his \"most unsettling sculpture\" in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter. \"I take full responsibility for 'Scary Lucy,' though by no means was that my intent or did I wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic Lucy image,\" Poulin wrote in the letter (PDF). \"From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy's beauty or my ability as a sculptor.\" Poulin said he has been talking to Celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture. It seems that cost has been the chief barrier. \"It puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community, they accept it, and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense.\" Poulin wrote in the letter. But the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind. \"I am willing to put my time and money into redoing the Lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years I can do a much better job,\" Poulin wrote. No thanks, Schrecengost said. He said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue. \"It would be reworked from the shoulders up -- the entire head, neck and shoulders, not just the face,\" Schrecengost said in a news release Tuesday. The town has set up a post office box for donations, which can also be made through Kickstarter. But the controversy may not be over. It seems that nearby Jamestown, New York, also has ties to Lucille Ball's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend. Schrecengost's Tuesday statement referred to an anonymous Facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising Jamestown's Lucille Ball profile at the expense of the Celoron statue. \"The best place for a life size statue of Lucy is right where it is now -- in Lucille Ball Memorial Park in her hometown, in the Village of Celoron, NY,\" he said.

Tim Farron was accused by the dead man's widow of 'betrayal' after an inquest found that Jo Stephenson jumped from the roof of his house while suffering 'intense stress'. Mr Stephenson, deputy leader of Cumbria County Council, fell from the three-storey property in Windermere after being vilified over new parking charges in Mr Farron's Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency. Now Mr Stephenson\u2019s widow Hilary has angrily accused Mr Farron \u2013 a former party president dubbed \u2018Saint Tim\u2019 because of his religious beliefs \u2013 of reneging on a deal to support her late husband over the policy. Tim Farron (left) was accused by Jo Stephenson's (centre) widow Hilary (right) of 'betrayal' after an inquest found that he jumped from the roof of his house while suffering 'intense stress' Mr Stephenson initially survived his fall and was coherent enough to tell the paramedics that he had intended to kill himself. He died of his injuries three weeks later. The shocking sequence of events unfolded after Mr Stephenson led controversial Lib Dem plans to boost the council's income by ending free street parking in Cumbria. Local sources claim that Mr Farron \u2013 favourite to replace Mr Clegg if the party flops in the Election \u2013 promised to support the charges in return for the exemption of Liberal Democrat-dominated parts of the county. But, according to Mrs Stephenson, when the plan provoked a furious backlash from local residents, Mr Farron stayed quiet as 59-year-old Mr Stephenson was bombarded with aggressive messages on Facebook and Twitter. 'They'd negotiated a deal but Tim reneged on it and shoved Jo into the forefront to take the wrath,' she told The Mail on Sunday. 'Jo would just say, 'it's not what gentlemen do, is it?' But it is what politicians do. I don't know the details of it [the deal]. I just know Farron reneged on it and it left Jo in a very uncomfortable position. He felt betrayed. 'When I found out that Tim Farron happened to be on holiday on the date of Jo's funeral, I was very pleased. Would I have barred him? Let's just say I was very happy that the date coincided with his holiday.' Kendal coroner's court heard last month that in the run-up to the day on which he jumped off his roof, Mr Stephenson had been under 'considerable political pressure', and 'preoccupied by a culmination of matters'. Nick Clegg's arch-rival for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats Tim Farron (pictured) was at the centre of a bitter row last night over the death of one of the party's councillors . He dialled 999 himself, telling the operator: 'Come quickly. I threw myself off the roof, I tried to kill myself.' The deputy coroner ruled that the fall was 'no accident' but stopped short of ruling Mr Stephenson committed suicide. Mrs Stephenson, who had two children with Mr Stephenson, does not believe her husband was suicidal but that he was so distressed by the personal attacks on him, he was not thinking properly. She recalled: 'I looked out of the bedroom window and saw an ambulance outside. I found Jo propped up against a chair talking to the paramedic on the phone.' Last month, Mr Farron launched a thinly-veiled leadership challenge to Mr Clegg, saying he would bring the party 'back from the dead'. The committed Christian brushed aside claims by enemies in the Clegg camp that he was a 'sanctimonious, God-bothering, treacherous little s***', and vowed to revive the Lib Dems. Mrs Stephenson questioned Tim Farron's 'saintly' image, saying: 'He wants everyone to love him and do what he says but he is just a typical modern politician who likes to whizz around the Lakes from one photo opportunity to another. 'He may see himself as a future leader of the Lib Dems but he's not the sort of character I would like to see in that job.' Mrs Stephenson said her husband was 'absolutely delightful,' adding: 'Jo didn't seek political glory, he wasn't like that.' Last night, Mr Farron, 44, said: 'I'm really saddened by these comments which are completely false and I strongly refute them. 'That does not change the fact that I have immense compassion for Hilary. Jo was an outstanding servant to our community and he is hugely missed.'",

The department store has slashed the prices on almost 200 products in an attempt to flog Christmas trees, festive ornaments and decorations - more than three months after December 25. It comes after\u00a0the major high street outlet reportedly spent \u00a37million on its tear-jerking 2014 Christmas advert campaign featuring Monty the penguin. John Lewis is still desperately trying to sell its leftover Christmas stock such as this Father Christmas decoration-just days before Easter . The department store giant has slashed its prices on its Christmas decorations and festive themed gifts such as this gold reindeer, cut from \u00a320 to \u00a310 . With just days to go until Easter, John Lewis has halved the price of many of its decorations and trees - knocking as much as \u00a3250 off the 9ft John Lewis Pre-Lit Peardrop with 500 lights, formerly \u00a3500. Meanwhile, a 64cm high 'Cambric and Cream Father Christmas Sack', is now available to buy half price at \u00a317.50. A plywood White Wooden LED Advent House is also priced at \u00a317.50 on the store's website - compared to \u00a335 in the build up to Christmas last year. John Lewis has knocked \u00a3250 in an attempt to get rid of their leftover stock- more than three months after the Christmas break . This wooden advent calendar is being sold at half price, \u00a317.50, one the store's website which is making a desperate bid to get rid of its Christmas trees, festive ornaments and decorations . The store is also trying to flog a 'Gold Glitter Tabletop Stag' for \u00a310 after reducing it from its original price of \u00a320. There are now 108 items priced at \u00a35 or less and 36 festive themed gifts and objects will set you back less than \u00a32. Their bid to sell off leftover stock comes just days before this year's first national holiday, when families tuck into Easter themed products like chocolate eggs. Office worker Georgina Adams from Southampton, Hampshire, was shocked to see the giant high street outlet still stocking the products. It comes after the major high street outlet reportedly spent a staggering \u00a37 million on its tear-jerking 2014 Christmas advert campaign . The 30-year-old said: 'It's crazy. Who wants to make decisions about Christmas at Easter? 'Everyone knows they go a bit over the top at Christmas - especially with their adverts - but selling old Christmas stock in April seems a bit odd.' A John Lewis spokeswoman said: 'We get demand for Christmas products all year round. 'While the majority of our customers might begin their Christmas purchases much nearer the festive season we do see interest in our seasonal offer all year round. 'Our in-store Christmas shops open in October and last year we saw Christmas become the most searched term on our website at the beginning of September. 'As with other seasonal offerings, if there is a demand for reduced Christmas items for sale post season then it makes sense to make such product available for customers.' A staggering 108 items are priced at \u00a35 or less and 36 festive themed gifts and objects will set you back less than \u00a32 . This cambric and cream Father Christmas sack was one of the many festive products which were being sold off cheaply on the John Lewis website . John Lewis' two minute advert, telling the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty, won high praise in the run up to Christmas last year. 1.Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 Christmas Day Truce 1914 . 2.John Lewis \u2013 Monty the Penguin . 3.Nike Football \u2013 Winner Stays . 4.Nike Football - The Last Game . 5.Always \u2013 Like A Girl . 6.Three \u2013 Sing It Kitty . 7.Marks & Spencer \u2013 Follow The Fairies . 8.Save The Children \u2013 Most Shocking Second a Day . 9.Guinness \u2013 Sapeurs . 10.Pepsi Max \u2013 Human Loop the Loop . The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel. The soundtrack was John Lennon\u2019s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell. It's uplifting story touched many and made Monty the penguin a bestselling gift but it ultimately lost out to Sainsbury's in the battle for best Christmas ad. The recreation of one of the most famous moments from the First World War by Sainsbury's saw it named the most viewed in the UK. It featured a 'creative interpretation' of Christmas Day 1914 when British and German soldiers laid down their weapons and met in no man's land. The supermarket chain reconstructed the trenches scene to celebrate their 20 years of support for the Royal British Legion, which runs the annual poppy campaign.",

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an \"unprecedented\" experiment.

Yelp, founded in 2004 by two former PayPal employees, is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor's offices. However, like many web businesses, Yelp's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site. Kaylie Milliken is the filmmaker behind Billion Dollar Bully, an ongoing documentary focused on Yelp's impact on small businesses. While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied. Scroll down for video . A racket? A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014 . Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise . 'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says. Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp. 'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he\u2019s complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn\u2019t figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company . Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production.\u00a0The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the\u00a0trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page. 'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on\u00a0CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive. 'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website . Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall . Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page. While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken. 'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads. Prost Production's Kickstarter campaign reached its $60,000 funding goal, and Milliken says she will resume filming in May with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the Sundance Film Festival.",

Up next, Rockhold wants a title shot and a shot at MMA history in New York. Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night. Luke Rockhold beat Lyoto Machida by second-round submission in New Jersey . Rockhold celebrates his victory and now wants a shot at the middleweight title . 'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.' Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort. Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage. Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center. 'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.' Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida . Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session . MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen . The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG. 'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said. Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event. Souza won with an armbar submission at 2:33 of the first round. Jacare Souza (right) grapples with Chris Camozzi on his way to victory in the first round . Souza needed less than five minutes to earn victory and also wants a middleweight title shot . Souza, who lost to Rockhold in his Strikeforce days, hoped he could earn a shot at Weidman's title with a fight against Olympic silver medalist Yoel Romero. But when Romero was injured, Camozzi stepped in on short notice - and a shorter fight. Souza won his eighth straight UFC fight and hoped a month ago a win would mean his name would get called next for a middleweight title fight. Machida-Rockhold and Souza-Romero would have been a Final Four showcase of the best of the UFC middleweight contenders. But Romero's last-minute scratch meant Souza likely has a longer wait for the biggest fight of his UFC career. 'I want to get the shot at the title next,' Souza said. 'It's my time. I'm coming off five victories.'",

But the diamond ring appears to have lost its sparkle according to experts who claim that women are abandoning the traditional jewel in favour of more exotic gems. The huge increase in demand for coloured stones, such as sapphires and rubies, has seen their prices soar. Scroll down for video . Kate Middleton proudly wore a Ceylon sapphire once owned by Princess Diana as her engagement ring . And experts say the trend might prove that diamonds are not forever after all, as the value of the jewels has been vastly overtaken by more fashionable stones. Demand has seen the value of some coloured stones increase by more than 2,000 per cent over the last ten years, with leading auctioneers now branding them a better investment than diamonds. Celebrities such as Kate Middleton, who proudly wore a Ceylon sapphire once owned by Princess Diana as her engagement ring, have driven the craze. A-list stars Beyonc\u00e9, Naomi Watts, Rosamund Pike and Mila Kunis have also played their part by flashing their beloved coloured gems on the red carpet. The number of women picking their own engagement rings is also thought to have had an effect, with men always likely to choose a traditional diamond. While diamonds are still broadly worth more money than softer stones such as emeralds, the increase in price generated by coloured stones in recent years has far overtaken diamonds. A-list stars Rosamund Pike by flashing beloved coloured gems on the red carpet . As the gems are much rarer than diamonds the surge in demand - especially from Asia - has played a significant part in driving up their cost. The surging popularity of coloured stones is one of the reasons leading auctioneers Bonhams include them in most sales around the world, alongside diamonds. Its auctioneers were delighted when a pair of 1930 Cartier art deco ruby and diamond brooches recently sold for \u00a3482,500, far outstripping the presale estimate of \u00a380,000 - \u00a3120,000. A single-stone ring by Van Cleef & Arpels featuring a Burmese ruby weighing 13.34 carats, sold for \u00a3350,500 to a Hong Kong buyer, breaking price-per-carat records in the UK last year. Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams, said that as well as being fashionable colured stones are also becoming seen as a sound investment. She said: 'There is a new move towards colour. Women are bolder in their choices and looking at alternatives to diamonds when it comes to engagement rings and everyday jewellery. 'Women are also in constant pursuit of something truly original, and a coloured stone, where every example is different they are able to have something unique. 'As ever, fashion is partly celebrity-led and we're seeing some of the world's biggest stars looking stunning in coloured gemstones on the red carpet.' Actress Mila Kunis also played her part, seen here wearing ruby jewellery to the Jupiter Ascending premiere . A ring featuring a Sri Lankan sapphire weighing 30.08 carats was recently sold by the auctioneers for \u00a3326,500. Bonhams said that a near identical ring sold a decade earlier for only \u00a311,950, equating to a 2,200 per cent increase in price-per-carat. Miss Ghika added: 'Diamonds are typically seen as the more 'robust' area in the gemstone market in terms of seeing a return on investment. 'But figures over the last decade demonstrate that coloured stones have actually overtaken diamonds in terms of growth.' A new world record for the most expensive ruby, regarded as the most valuable coloured gem, was set last year when a 8.62 carat Burmese stone sold for \u00a35.4million.",

Peter Hiett, a decorated former prison guard at Feltham Young Offenders Institution, said staff would put inmates in a cell padded with mattresses and leave them to fight out any differences. The 49-year-old, who worked at the jail for eight years and was commended for bravery, said some workers would even stay and watch the battle unfold, while others 'turned a blind eye to it'. He also said gangs controlled entire wings at the jail in Hounslow, south west\u00a0London, leaving staff afraid to visit some areas of the prison for fear of being attacked. Scroll down for video . Peter Hiett, a decorated former prison guard at Feltham Young Offenders Institution in Hounslow (pictured), claims staff\u00a0regularly arrange brutal fights between rival criminals behind bars at Britain's toughest jail . The claims echo scenes from 1999 film Fight Club starring Brad Pitt, in which gangsters organise mass brawls in underground 'fight clubs'. Mr Hiett told\u00a0The Sunday People: 'It was like a sport for them. If two inmates had a grudge they'd put them together in a room to sort it out. 'They only stopped when one was knocked out or couldn't defend themselves any more.' His revelations come after he left the prison in January last year, amid claims he was forced out for trying to lift the lid on the goings-on. He claims the in-fighting was often kept hidden from the overriding authorities, with the prison's management setting up a Behaviour Management Group to 'fiddle the assault figures'. He said common tactics were to treat group attacks as just one assault and to encourage inmates to admit to the lesser charge of health and safety over assault. The former officer said: 'There would be 15 or 20 lads from the same gang on the same wing. They would protect each other, deal drugs. 'And if they saw another gang member all hell broke loose \u2013 their wars don't stop when they're behind bars. 'But if an inmate assaulted someone, the governor didn't want it written down like that. Staff would advise prisoners to admit a lesser charge.' There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution last year , a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons found (file picture) Claims from former prison officer Peter Hiett about Feltham echo that of scenes in 1999 film Fight Club (above) Earlier this year, it was revealed that inmates at Feltham represent 48 different gangs, fuelling a 'constant juggling' by prison officers to keep the boys apart. A report found there were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at the young offenders' institution, a significant amount of which was gang-related. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said. Former Feltham prison officer Emma Beard pictured outside court ahead of being jailed . Former prison offer Peter Hiett was also among the guards who reported fellow worker Emma Beard for performing sex acts on an inmate in his cell. Beard, a married mother-of-four, had sex with teenage murderer Danny McLean, then aged 18, at Feltham Young Offenders Institution and even wrote love letters to him, which included intimate photographs. Beard, then aged 31, pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office and was jailed for 12 months at Isleworth Crown Court in 2010. Jailing her, Judge Oliver told her: 'You put the security of yourself and the other officers at the young offenders' institution at risk and that is a serious matter. 'It has to be prison for you, you cannot in your role, break the law and expect to get away with it.' The number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous HMIP inspection, but remained 'too high' with 262 incidents between July 2014 and January this year, including 79 assaults on staff. Some incidents were deemed 'very serious' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a 'very determined way'. Feltham is divided into two sites, with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site A, and 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site B. Mr Hiett said he tried to raise his concerns several times internally before he eventually approached Jeremy Wright \u2013 who was the Minister for Prisons at the time. Mr Wright ordered an inspection of the prison in March 2013 and called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run. Inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted. Despite calls for an overhaul, Feltham was named last year as the most violent prison in England and Wales by the Howard League for Penal Reform. But the authorities believe improvements are underway and it is simply taking time to see the changes because of the 'multiple challenges that need to be addressed'. Following the publication of January's report, Lin Hinnigan, the chief executive of the Youth Justice Board, said: 'It is clear from the report that, since the last inspection in 2013, improvements to Feltham A have been made; and we are grateful to the inspection team for recognising the dedication of the staff who work there. 'However, and as the report also acknowledges, the young people placed in Feltham are some of the most challenging of the cohort we have across the youth secure estate. 'Improving Feltham A is very much a work in progress, and will take time because of the multiple challenges that need to be addressed.' In response to Mr Hietts' claims, a spokesman for HM Prison Service told MailOnline: 'These inflammatory and damaging allegations are completely untrue and do a huge disservice to the hard working staff at YOI Feltham. 'It is totally untrue to claim that staff have been complicit in any acts of violence, or that there are \"no-go\" areas within the establishment. 'It is also absolutely wrong to say that figures relating to incidents at Feltham have been in any way altered.'",

Six players - Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario Del Fabro, Marco Silvestri, Souleymane Doukara and Edgar Cani - withdrew from the squad on the eve of Saturday's trip to Charlton citing injuries, and this is just the latest incident in another turbulent period at Elland Road. A 'freakish set of events' was how beleaguered boss Neil Redfearn described the sextet's absence after the game but Morison, who scored Leeds' goal in the 2-1 defeat at The Valley, told BBC West Yorkshire Sport: 'We're around it every day. Leeds United striker Steve Morison (centre) admits he is surprised by the chaos at Elland Road at the moment . Giuseppe Bellusci and three other Italians were among those who withdrew form the Leeds squad . Souleymane Doukara was another player that withdrew as part of the latest drama at Elland Road . 'People draw their own conclusions over what happened (with the withdrawals). It's a tough situation and you have to take everything at face value, but it's been like it all season in one way or another.' When asked if there was a split in the camp, the 31-year-old added: 'It's just been one of those seasons where every day something different has happened. 'I've never known anything like it in football and I've played for teams scrapping for their lives - Millwall last year - and teams that have been promoted. I've played in the Premier League with a bunch of Championship players that should never have stayed up and the one thing we had ultimately was a team and team spirit. 'Sometimes you can get away with being very, very average - I would class myself as an average footballer - but I've had a team around me and it works.' Former Leeds captain Trevor Cherry, meanwhile, branded the players who withdrew at short notice from Saturday's match a 'disgrace' and called for them to be sacked by the club. Italian quartet Antenucci, Bellusci, Del Fabro and Silvestri, Frenchman Doukara and Albanian Cani all told Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. According to the manager, Silvestri had been rested since sustaining a knock but had been expected to recover, while Antenucci and Cani declared themselves unfit after training on Thursday with the rest pulling out following a 'light' session on Friday. But Cherry was unimpressed and wants the players out of Elland Road. 'I would sack them and take the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) on,' he said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek. 'I don't think players can do that, it's scandalous and it's just another story for Leeds United that is disgraceful.' Striker Antenucci used Twitter to defend himself, as did goalkeeper Silvestri who posted a picture of a cut on his back suffered against Norwich on Tuesday night. However, Cherry questioned if they were legitimate reasons to withdraw. 'In the old days you used to play with anything, cuts or one thing or another,' he said. 'The managers had a big say in whether you were fit or not. You didn't just come in and say 'I've got a headache, I'm going home'. I'm sure with George Graham or Don Revie, I can't imagine what would have happened if you'd have done that.' The withdrawals continued the chaos that has plagued Leeds. Mirco Antenucci was also among the six players to withdraw from the squad ahead of the defeat by Charlton . Neil Redfearn had a depleted squad to pick from when six players withdrew ahead of the Charlton game . Redfearn's position has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking over from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Club president Massimo Cellino has been banned since January after being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy, but is due to return in a fortnight's time. Cherry, who played for Leeds between 1972 and 1982, was left to lament the situation at his old club. 'It's a club that's a shambles and has been a shambles for 10 years,' the ex-England defender said. 'We just stutter from disaster to disaster, joke to joke. If it wasn't sickening it would be funny. You couldn't write a book about Leeds United and what's happened. 'Personally, I don't know the Italian guy but I don't think he realises the size of the club, it's just a little play thing and he's making a mess of it in my opinion.'",

Riot of colour: The Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year . Superstition: People travel from nearby towns to join the Net Boat Fair. Other Water Temple Fairs are held around Chinese New Year. Fishermen from the area take their boats out for show, hoping for good fortune and blessing . Extravagance: An aerial view of the 2015 China Jiangnan Net Boat Fair which commemorates an ancient hero . Starting on different dates in the western calendar, the fair happens annually according to the Chinese Lunar calendar. This year, it began yesterday and the celebrations are expected to last three to seven days, with festivities sometimes being extended to a month long. One of the highlights of the carnival is the Net Boat Fair which showcases the unique culture of Jiangnan water people. One of the most anticipated performances is the 'tie the perfume to your skin' which sees performers attach metal hooks to their forearms. On the other side of the hook hangs a censer containing incense\u00a0or sometimes even heavy anchors with flowers in them to mask the natural smell of the fishing town. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing . The traditional local folklore carnival pays homage to Liu Chengzhong, a figure who led people in annihilating locusts in the Yuan Dynasty . Tradition: Fishermen and their families dress up in traditional clothes. About 50 different folklore groups and nearly two thousand people will be joining the celebrations. It will be the biggest Net Boat Fair in 60 years . The Fair commemorates General Lui Chengzhong, a hero in the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), who successfully eliminated pests during a massive drought. When the Yuan Dynasty came to an end, General Lui killed himself by jumping in the river as an act of loyalty to the Yuan emperor. The locals built the Lui King temple for him and celebrated his heroic acts. Mr Li, one of the participants, told Jia Xing Ping Dao: 'I am the sixth generation to come to this temple fair. 'My great-grandfather once said the celebrations were even more extravagant than what we have now. 'We want to pray for safety and for the Gods to give us proper weather next year.' Music and beats: Little drums are used to scare away angry spirits. This event was listed as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in China in 2011, along with Chinese abacus, an ancient calculator . Cultural heritage: Fishermen prepare shrine offerings, including food, wine, pork, fruit and snacks. An elaborate ritual will be performed on the boats to give thanks to the Gods and the ancestors . The Net Boat Fair has already been included in the list of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage. One of the most important agenda this year is giving out the 'folklore religion activity' certificate to the Liu King temple. Jiangnan Mayor Liang Bokai sauid: 'This marks the first certificate of its kind. It is a massive step for the preservation, promotion and legacy of this folklore religion in the Liu King temple. 'We will further promote our local customs and culture and combine it with tourism in order to put out a new image.' Jiangnan folklore: 'Stepping on whites boats' is a custom for fishermen. Their boats are known to be very unstable because of the exceptionally long frame. Fishermen remodel the boats with a wooden see-saw in the middle. Two people stands on the edge of both sides and jump to make the boat go forward . Tourism: It is a very popular tourist attraction as well. Vendors and shopkeepers appeal their products to passers-by, participants gather for pictures and others pray for blessings .",

Around 50 obese pupils at Jianxin Primary School, in China's eastern Zhejiang province, are put through their paces by instructors every day after school to help them lose weight. The Kung Fu Panda classes were set up after a survey showed that 5 per cent of its\u00a0858 students were obese, with one 11-year-old pupil weighing in at 180lbs, reports\u00a0The People's Daily Online. Around 50 obese children from\u00a0Jianxin Primary School, in eastern China, are being sent to special Kung Fu Panda classes in order to help them lose weight . Teachers set up the lessons after a survey revealed 5 per cent of the school's 800 pupils were obese, including one 11-year-old who weighs 180lbs . While some of the exercises may appear grueling, instructors say they are focused on making fitness fun, and also work with parents to help control the pupils' weights . Despite some grueling-looking exercises appearing in these pictures, the school insists that the classes focus on making fitness fun. The lessons are named after the Dreamworks film of the same name, in which an overweight panda becomes a Kung Fu master. School Principal Yan Xue told reporters from Urban Express Newspaper: 'When a child is obese there are serious negative health consequences. 'The child could also develop a lack of self-confidence as well as the possibility of being socially excluded. 'Diabetes and high blood pressure are also risks therefore the issue of obesity must be tackled at an early stage.' The school says teachers have been asked to keep an eye on their students' weights, and inform parents if they start to pile on the pounds. The school's headmaster said he wanted to tackle the issue of obesity to stop the children developing health problems in later life, and becoming socially isolated . The Kung Fu Panda classes, which inspectors say are aimed at making fitness fun, are named after a Dreamworks film of the same name in which an overweight panda becomes a kung fu master . Teachers at the school have also been told to monitor each child's weight, and will report back to their parents if they start piling on the pounds . Class instructor\u00a0Wang Tao added: 'Children\u2019s exercise classes are different to adults. We do not want to make the children afraid or hate coming to the lessons. 'We foster a relaxed atmosphere where the children can enjoy themselves so even if they are a bit noisy we won\u2019t stop them. 'After just 3 weeks of Kung Fu Panda classes there have been a number of students who have seen visible differences in their physiques take place, this is also the result of our close cooperation with the families.' He added that since setting the classes up they have become extremely popular, including with the senior girls. One of the fitness instructors said that, since setting up the classes, they have even become popular with children of a healthy weight, especially the older girls . Pupils complete star jumps during a Kung Fu Panda fitness class at a school in eastern China . The school has also enlisted the help of a nutritionist to help the pupils maintain a healthy weight. Principle Yan added: 'This is an important stage of a child\u2019s development and we are giving them the best nutritional advice from a scientific perspective which will help them control their weight but also not affect their physical development. 'We ask parents to list their weekly food they give their children and our nutritionist will give individual advice on their choices.' The classes have been so successful that they are now going to be used as a model for other schools throughout the city. According to the World Health Organisation, obesity in China is a major problem, with rates of the illness reaching 20 per cent in some cities . Obesity rates in China have shot up dramatically in a generation as most of the country was in the grip of a famine just 50 years ago .",

Kinsman has said Winston raped her in December 2012.  A prosecutor decided against bringing criminal charges in the case. In the lawsuit filed Thursday, Kinsman alleges sexual battery, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Winston has said the sex was consensual. CNN obtained the following statement from Winston's attorney David Cornwell. \"This stunt was expected,\" the statement said. \"Ms. Kinsman's false accusations have already been exposed and rejected six times.  This time will be no different. Mr. Winston welcomes the opportunity to clear his name with the truth. Mr. Winston is looking forward to the upcoming [NFL] draft.  He will not permit this ploy to distract him as he begins the journey of fulfilling his lifelong dream of being a championship quarterback in the National Football League.\" CNN doesn't normally identify the alleged victims of sexual assault; however, Kinsman revealed her name this year in a documentary about rape on college campuses. FSU hearing clears Winston . Winston led the Florida State Seminoles to a national championship for the 2013 season and won the Heisman, given to the most outstanding collegiate football player. He is expected to be a top pick in the NFL Draft, which begins April 30. \"As for timing, we didn't want to wait until the eve of the draft or after he signed a contract,\" said Kinsman's attorney John Clune. \"As soon as we finished the various motions briefing on the FSU case, we turned our attention to Jameis and got it filed.\" Kinsman also sued the university in January. According to police documents in the rape case, Kinsman said Winston raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. Kinsman also said she did not remember much of what happened next but that she remembered being in a ground-floor apartment, where Winston took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections, according to police documents. Kinsman reported the alleged assault to FSU campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she told Tallahassee police that Winston was the attacker. Tallahassee's interim police chief at the time, Tom Coe, said the woman \"broke off contact\" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family said a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a \"big football town\" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Winston didn't play during the 2012 season but came to Florida State as one of the nation's top quarterback recruits, according to recruiting rankings.",

The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just \u00a365 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just \u00a33,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant\u2019s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing \u2018management consultancy activities\u2019. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of \u00a33,378, down from \u00a318,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a \u00a345million house in west London - married the heiress in a \u00a37million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia\u2019s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated \u00a370,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone\u2019s family is worth an estimated \u00a33billion - and the couple are said to own a \u00a3300,000 Ferrari, \u00a3123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a \u00a3100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London . Company: Brigante Business Developments is based in this building (above) in Battersea, south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: \u2018Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.\u2019 Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone. He was robbed of a \u00a350,000 Rolex and a \u00a320,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV, but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence. MailOnline has approached a representative of the Ecclestone family for comment on the accounts.",

The NBC sketch show parodied the daytime CNN Newsroom, which turned into a series of let-downs when it emerged there was no footage for the stories they were covering. But the ingenious producers for the skit managed to cover up with abysmal animations to illustrate the Germanwings crash, U.S.-Iran diplomacy, and domestic politics. Scroll down for video . Cutting edge: SNL writers joked that CNN's animations look like they belong in 1985. Above was 'their impression' of what the doomed pilot of the crashed Germanwings jet may have looked like trying to get into the cockpit . Real thing: Above is an actual animation CNN aired to illustrate the pilot not being able to get back in . An informative graphic of a man opening a door, and a producer's image of what the doomed pilot going to the bathroom may have looked like graced the screens, mocking their coverage of the tragedy. It was seemingly inspired by a much-derided, clunky animation of a man hammering on a cockpit door. Cecily Strong, playing anchor Brooke Baldwin, introduced a badly-animated hand grasping at a doorknob. A reporter then chimed in: 'We were lucky to get the same team who did the Dire Straits Money for Nothing music video in 1985.' The problems continued when CNN was unable to get a fly-on-the-wall view of Iran's nuclear negotiations - and went for a puppet show instead. Bobby Moynihan, playing a reporter on the ground, explained by saying: 'We couldn't get any footage from the actual negotiations - but once again CNN has the next best thing'. 'Next best thing': For its next story, CNN had no footage of the Iran nuclear animations, so went with Muppets-style puppets . Absurd: The network was imagined providing imagery for coverage of Indiana's religious freedom law through the medium of interpretative dance . Viewers were confronted with four Muppets-style puppets, including one representing John Kerry. A handshake to celebrate a deal being struck quickly escalated, with the Secretary of State sharing a passionate kiss with a U.S. diplomat. The theater of the absurd peaked when the network admitted it hadn't bothered to send anybody to Indiana to cover the controversial religious freedom law there - so demonstrated with an interpretative dance instead. They later added in 'random commentary' from Don Lemon, played by Michael Che, which consisted of the anchor repeating 'black people need to pull up their pants.' Then segment received a rapturous response on social media, with dozens of fans tweeting their appreciation. Against the grain: Donald Trump spoke out against the skit, which he said was insensitive . Even some CNN personnel enjoyed the ribbing.\u00a0Brenna Williams, an associate producer at the network, said in response to the Iran sketch: 'Don't be surprised if I pitch a puppet politics piece on Monday' However, one high-profile dissenter was Donald Trump, who called laughing at the air disaster 'disgusting'. Earlier in the show, sketchwriters turned their attention to the NCAA finals, hot on the heels of Duke's Blue Devils and the Wisconsin Badgers winning their way into the April 6 final. Jahlil was busy: NBC imagined the impossible scenario of a college basketball player putting his studies ahead of sport . A satirical skit imagined the Blue Devils coach acknowledging that his players were students before athletes - and holding back Jahlil Okafor from the big game so he could revise for a test. Keenan Thompson, posing as head coach Mike Krzyzewski, said star player Okafor would be replaced by a 36-year-old incompetent to bone up on biology instead. He told baffled reporters: 'These guys get paid in education - and if we can't give them that it'd be like Duke didn't pay me my salary of $10million this year, which would be insane!'",

The charity announced on Wednesday that it has decided to continue to look abroad for millions of dollars while limiting donor nations to a select group of six. The change in policy comes as former board member Hillary Clinton undertakes her presidential campaign. The foundation's reliance on funding from several Middle East governments that suppress dissent and women's rights \u2014 concerns that the State Department focused on during her stint as secretary of state \u2014 sparked criticism and gave Republicans a new offensive against the leading Democrat. Clinton resigned from the foundation's board last week. Scroll down for video . Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, pictured on Tuesday, meets with local residents at the Jones St. Java House in LeClaire, Iowa. She resigned from the board of the Clinton foundation last week . The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation's board said on Wednesday night that future donations will only be allowed from the governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom \u2014 all nations that previously supported the charity's health, poverty and climate change programs. Longtime U.S. allies, the six maintain relatively uncontroversial ties to the U.S. While direct contributions from other governments would be halted, those nations could continue participating in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary program that encourages donors to match contributions from others to tackle international problems without direct donations to the charity. Donations greater that $25million . Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) Fred Eychaner . Frank Giustra, The Radcliffe Foundation .

However, the foundation will stop holding CGI meetings abroad \u2014 a final session is scheduled for Morocco in May \u2014 and most foreign governments will no longer be allowed to sponsor programs. Clinton Foundation donations between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $55 million and $130 million. In addition to the six nations that will be allowed to continue donating, the others were Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Kuwait, Italy, Brunei, Taiwan and the Dominican Republic. The foundation also will begin disclosing its donors every quarter instead of annually \u2014 an answer to long-standing criticism that the foundation's once-a-year lists made it difficult to view shifts and trends in the charity's funding. Former President Bill Clinton and other foundation officials have long defended the charity's transparency, but the new move signaled sensitivity to those concerns, particularly as his wife begins her race for the White House. Hillary Clinton's campaign referred questions about the board's action to the foundation. Last month, while she was still a board member, Clinton defended the family charity to questions about its reliance on donations from foreign governments, saying the foundation had 'hundreds of thousands of donors.' Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said that under the new disclosure policy, 'the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to\u00a0accountability\u00a0while protecting programs that are\u00a0improving the lives of millions of people around the world'. But he also insisted that the old annual disclosure policy went 'above and beyond what's required by\u00a0voluntarily disclosing\u00a0our more than 300,000 donors on our website for anyone to see'. Hillary Clinton had previously agreed with the Obama administration to limit new foreign donations to the foundation while she served as secretary of state, but at least six nations that previously contributed still donated to the charity during her four-year stint. Bill and Hillary Clinton address the audience during a Clinton Global Initiative event last September in New York. Donations to their foundation between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $55 million and $130 million . Bill Clinton in Saudi Arabia for the Global Competitiveness Forum in 2011. Saudi Arabia has been a generous donor to the Clinton Foundation - but will not be allowed to donate while Hillary makes her bid for the White House due to criticism over\u00a0Middle East governments which suppress dissent and women's rights . In one case, the foundation failed to notify the State Department about a donation from the government of Algeria. Clinton Foundation officials had hinted in recent weeks that the organization was considering new limits on foreign government donations after several media accounts this year raised questions about the foundation's reliance on those practices. The foundation's board began discussions over the past two days about altering some of the charity's procedures in an effort that officials said was aimed at improving transparency without harming fundraising for critical programs. Potential problems may exist among some of the six governments that will be allowed to continue providing direct donations to the foundation. For examples, the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, which has already given the foundation between $250,000 and $500,000, has pushed for the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. The project is a domestic flashpoint in the climate change debate as well as a contentious issue regarding its impact on jobs and oil supplies. President  Obama has yet to decide whether to approve the pipeline, which would span several U.S. states, but he has already vetoed one bill aimed at swiftly approving the plan. Foundation officials said the charity is not involved in the Keystone XL issue and has a 'strong program' aimed at curbing reducing carbon emissions.",

The broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with the condition. But patients would have to eat several pounds of the vegetable every day to derive any significant benefit. Sulforaphane in its natural form is also too unstable to turn into a medicine. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment. A single dose of the drug, known as Sulforadex or SFX-01, is the equivalent of eating 5.5lb of broccoli in one day. In tests on mice affected by osteoarthritis, Sulforadex significantly improved bone architecture, gait balance and movement. Professor Andrew Pitsillides, who co-led the research at the Royal Veterinary College in London, said: \u2018These initial results are very positive for such an experiment and we have convinced ourselves that sulforaphane is a promising agent for the treatment of osteoarthritis. \u2018The clinical development of sulforaphane has been held back by the fact that it is inherently unstable \u2013 SFX-01 is a major advance in this area.\u2019 Professor Pitsillides added: \u2018Nearly nine million people in the UK have osteoarthritis and it costs the NHS more than \u00a35 billion every year.

Chen Yuntao, 38, wears a horse mask as he kneels on the busy streets of Hefei City, next to a sign asking for 'kind-hearted' people to get on his back for a ride for five yuan \u2013 the equivalent of 54p. The unusual fundraising is part of a desperate bid to raise money for his nine-year-old son Chen Minghao, who is suffering from leukaemia. Desperate father Chen Yuntao, 38, has started dressing as a horse and begging people to ride him in exchange for 54p. He is frantically trying to raise money for his son's ever-growing medical bills for his cancer treatment . Mr Chen kneels on the ground as he begs and has a sign, explaining his plight. The family are already in huge debt after son Minghao underwent 20 course of chemotherapy for leukaemia, and now the cancer has returned . The family is 160,000 yuan (\u00a317,500) in debt for treatment he has already received, having already spent 200,000 yuan (\u00a321,800) on medical bills, The People's Daily Online reports. The next course of therapy will cost between 400,000 and 500,000 yuan (\u00a343,600 to \u00a354,600). After Mr Chen first starting begging at the entrance of a subway the city management turned up within minutes to move him along \u2013 but when they learnt about his heart-breaking situation, they offered to help find him a better spot. 'I saw others raising funds in the street using a sign so I gave it a try', the 38-year-old said. 'If it wasn't the very last resort I would never have thought I would be begging on the street. 'Yesterday my son just completed the current stage of his chemotherapy and the doctors say that as soon as the boy is physically ready he can proceed to the next stage of treatment which I have no money for.' 'In the village I saw children paying to ride on horses so I thought I could pretend to be a horse and offer rides to raise money for my son. For my son I will gladly do anything.' Little Minghao, nine, has been in and out of hospital for treatment since 2011. His father said begging on the street while dressed as a horse was a 'last resort', but he would 'gladly do anything' for his child . As yet nobody has taken the opportunity to ride Mr Chen, but plenty of kind-hearted strangers have donated money. He came up with the idea of dressing up as a horse after watching children pay to be taken on a ride . Minghao was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in December 2011. After 20 courses of chemotherapy he was finally able to leave hospital in 2013 \u2013 but during a routine check-up in March the family was told his cancer had returned. As yet no-one has ridden Mr Chen, but many passers-by have donated money to him. Dr Xu, who is looking after Minghao, said in all the years the family had been in hospital he had never seen the father wear new clothes or bring the child in food. 'I know they are very poor but I didn't know that they were in such poverty', he said. Doctors of Minghao, pictured in his hospital bed, said they didn't realise the family was so desperately poor. The next course of his cancer treatment will cost up to 500,000 Yuan, but the family is entitled to some relief . 'To know Mr Chen is begging on the street in order to raise funds for his child is really sad and upsetting.' Nine-year-old Minghao said: 'The needles are not painful anymore. I hope to recover soon so that I can go back to school.' The family will qualify for seriously illness release on the next course of treatment, meaning they will have a 90 per cent reimbursement. However, Mr Chen will still need to find another 50,000 Yuan (\u00a35,500) plus ongoing post-treatment medical expenses if Minghao begins to recover.",

Brave Finley Lamb suffers from rare brain abnormality Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia - which means many of his 'grey matter' cells have not migrated to the correct position. It left the boy, from Wallasey, Merseyside, unable to walk and talk, and with a 90 per cent chance of developing Epilepsy. Finley Lamb, five, pictured with his dad Dan and mother Sara, suffers from a rare brain abnormality . He is also highly likely to suffer heart, lung and bowel problems. But the five-year-old amazed mother Sara when he took his first steps last year and has continued to defy the odds by starting primary school - and he even makes the journey on foot. 'It was around May last year when Finley just got up on his own and walked across the room - we were amazed,' said the mother-of-two, 37. 'It just seemed to click with him and ever since then he has been building up from 50 metres a day, now to two or three miles five days a week. 'His programme says he has to do at least two miles a day and he can even get up curbs now on his own and walk up steps with a rail which is amazing. 'When Finley was diagnosed with PVNH we were told he would probably never walk or talk - but now he is in mainstream school and playing with the other kids and his little brother. 'We just can't believe his progress. We never thought he would be able to lead an independent life, but now there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to. We are so pleased.' Finley defied the odds to take his first steps last year and now enjoys walking the two miles to school . Finley made huge progress after he started a programme designed specifically for him by the Family Hope Center, based in Philadelphia, USA, just two years ago in April 2013. The centre treats children with special needs and developmental delays and suggested special exercises and lifestyle changes intended to stimulate Finley's brain. Finley was diagnosed with PVNH when he was two years old, which affects around just 50 children in the UK. But the determined schoolboy has made huge developments - with his brain function going from 54 per cent to 76 per cent and his mobility increasing from that of a seven-week-old baby to a two-year-old toddler. And he now attends St Peter and St Paul Primary on the Wirral, Merseyside. Sara - who also has a three-year-old son Noah with husband Dan - said: 'Finley has made so much progress and that is why I am so passionate about getting this message out. 'It is hard to think what he would be like had we not found the Family Hope Center and he still wasn't able to walk or talk. And he was under a lot of emotional stress.

Raymond Billam illegally pocketed \u00a315,000 of taxpayers' money after he said he was severely disabled due to back and knee problems. But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team . Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around. But between September 2008 and April 2014 he pulled on the green and black shirt of Ingsfield Lane football club and two other teams in the Mexborough and District Sunday League. In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name. But he could not provide investigators with a list of names. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing \u00a315,066 through dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances which affected his disability living allowance. Chris Peace, defending, said Billam, who has four grandchildren, had worked as a contractor for Yorkshire Water for 16 years until he suffered a serious back injury in 2006 which needed surgery. He initially  made a legitimate claim and went from 13 to 18 and a half stones and had problems with drinking and gambling. 'He was in a bit of a state,' said Mr Peace. The court heard that playing football helped Billam recover from the\u00a0the low point in his life. Billam had claimed more than \u00a315,000 in incapacity benefit when the Department of Work and Pensions were tipped off . Unknown to the grandfather-of-four he was secretly filmed by fraud investigators donning his green and black shirt . Billam was sentenced to a 26-week suspended prison sentence after he admitted benefit fraud . Billam, who was taking jobs as a self employed plumber by October 2013, accepted that he should have notified the Department of Work and Pensions earlier that he was fit to work. 'The allowance was a regular source of income and he had three children at home and it was very difficult to do without that,' his lawyer said. 'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off. Billam was given a 26-week jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and he will be subject to an electronically monitored daily curfew for four months. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'",

One user posted on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter: 'She is a REAL tough girl! Those who say they are so tough every single day are not tough at all!'

The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside\u00a0Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate\u00a0as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.",

Norfolk Police continued to look for Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, who has been missing since March 2, and focused on a pond near Carrsville after a new tip. Local resident Steve Hines said that divers were searching the outer edges of the pond for the Longwood University freshman's phone, which sent strange text messages to her mother shortly after her disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police are searching a pond near Carrsville, Virginia, in an attempt to find the cell phone of Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was last seen on March 2. AJ Hadsell (left) was last seen driving near her parents' home in Norfolk and her stepfather Wesley Hadsell (right) was taken into custody late last month after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours . The teenager was last seen when she was home for spring break driving near her home in Norfolk, roughly 40 miles from the pond searched Friday, according to\u00a013 News Now. Hines said that police showed him a picture and asked him if he had seen a white van for Quality Plumbing. He said that he had seen the vehicle, which belongs to a company where Hadsell's stepfather Wesley works, driving along the rural road. He had been working in nearby Franklin, Virginia, around the time of the disappearance. The stepfather of the teenager, 36, was taken into police custody late last month amid claims that he knows who has taken his daughter. He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Wesley was been locked up on six charges including four charges of obstructing justice, one charge of possessing ammunition after a felony and one charge of breaking and entering. He said he broke into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter against her will. Wesley Hadsell, left, has admitted breaking into the home of the person that he believes took his daughter AJ, right, against her will. The stepfather has a criminal record including dropped rape and kidnapping charges . Residents of Carrsville reported a white plumbing van for the company Wesley Hadsell works for driving suspiciously around the pond . 'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com. Wesley has admitted to spending roughly 18 minutes inside the home, where he says he searched for evidence by going through the trash and searching under the carpet. He said he even punched the family dog out of anger. While searching the property AJ's stepfather claims that he discovered her jacket. 'I found my daughter's jacket in his couch rolled up behind the cushion,' he said. 'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light. It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.' Officially police have said that they are not ruling out foul play and they have no suspects. During a search of Wesley's hotel room police found 72 rounds of nine-millimeter ammunition. He has aroused local suspicions on social media in part because he has a lengthy felony criminal record. In 2005 his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states. Charges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. Police have not ruled out foul play in the disappearance of the Longwood University freshman, which has lasted for more than a month . Police spent over 12 hours combing a large, remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake following a tip that some of AJ's clothing had being found on the side of the road late last month . He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR. Now he says that he is a changed man. Wesley and his wife were estranged when he was arrested, but it is not clear what their relationship was at the time of the disappearance. Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received text messages from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not sure that the person sending them was actually the missing girl. Wesley Hadsell was denied bond and the judge said the he was trying to impede the investigation into his stepdaughter's disappearance, according to the Virginian-Pilot. He admitted to increasing cocaine use, but said that he just wants to see his daughter home. A neighbor reported seeing AJ driving 'with purpose' and then saw a white four-door vehicle following about a minute behind her. They say Hadsell was followed by a white four-door compact car less than one minute later, and that another neighbor spotted a similar white car in the family's driveway around the same time. AJ's family and friends discovered items of her clothing two weeks ago near the side of the road in a remote wooded area in coastal Chesapeake. Four items were found that belonged to her. AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nWashington (CNN)It's the mistake that Hillary Clinton won't make again: ignoring her gender. The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University.  \"People are ready for a woman president.  The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\" According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again . In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough. She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on. The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history. But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics. \"She is the gender card.  She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it. She is the woman candidate. She has shared women's experiences. Being a mom and a grandmother,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.  \"She will just naturally bring it in. If she overplayed it, which she won't, it could backfire.\" Republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the Obama years.  The Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's president, put it this way at the group's recent annual meeting: \"Eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\" Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didn't think it would be Clinton. \"There's a couple of things there. Trust, honesty -- those get in her way,\" Blackburn said. \"As we talk about the polling that is out there, that gets in Hillary's way and she's not authentic.\" In 2014, Democratic candidates such as former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits. Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues. And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans. Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\" \"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. \"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign.  You aren't going to win 100% of women.\" Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men. Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness. \"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said. And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell. But Clinton will have some high-profile champions. Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. \"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I'm ready for Hillary. And America is ready for Hillary. She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\" At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\" In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes. But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.",

Few visitors are allowed beyond the 'No Trespassing' sign and a remote-controlled gate and into the desert and mountain environment reminiscent of the Air Force's renowned Area 51 in Nevada. The privileged who do get inside decline to describe what they've seen, typically citing confidentiality agreements. Billionaires: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (left) and SpaceX Elon Musk (right) have seemingly unlimited resources \u2014 Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion . Mysterious:\u00a0The presence of Blue Origin, LLC, the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, barely registers in Van Horn, Texas, a way station along Interstate 10 . Facility: A SpaceX rocket is seen in Cape Canaveral, Florida, in this February 2015 file image. SpaceX is frequently in the headlines thanks to its nearly $2 billion federal contract, and its attempts to reuse booster rockets have been rocky . 'No one gets in other than employees,' says Robert Morales, editor of the weekly Van Horn Advocate newspaper. At the opposite end \u2014 of Texas and the competition \u2014 is the highly visible SpaceX venture, led by PayPal co-founder and electric car maker Elon Musk. His company contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and is building a launch site about 600 miles from Van Horn, on the southernmost Texas Gulf coast, with the much-publicized goal of sending humans to Mars. SpaceX and Blue Origin are among several U.S. companies engaged in the private space business. Both men have seemingly unlimited resources \u2014 Bezos' wealth is estimated at nearly $35 billion, Musk's at $12 billion \u2014 and lofty aspirations: launching a new era of commercial space operations, in part by cutting costs through reusable rockets. Texas' glory days of space exploration, when 'Right Stuff' Mercury astronauts trained in Houston and the city's name was the first word spoken on the moon by Neil Armstrong, are long gone. The utilitarian Space Shuttle fell to budget cuts, depletion and age, leaving astronauts to hitch rides on Russian rockets. Any success by the newcomers would offer 'significant potential for re-invigorating space research and development in the state,' said John Junkins, director of the Center for Mechanics and Control at Texas A&M's Department of Aerospace Engineering. Earlier this month, Bezos announced his company's new hydrogen rocket engine, designed for suborbital missions, had completed hundreds of tests at the West Texas site, adding, 'soon we'll put it to the ultimate test of flight.' That could come late this year. A more powerful engine for orbital flights, fueled by liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas, is being developed with United Launch Alliance, a venture of aerospace veterans Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Blue Origin officials declined requests for an interview and site visit. 'I'm so sorry,' spokeswoman Brooke Crawford said. 'It's just the way it is.' Secretive:\u00a0The privileged who do get inside Blue Origin decline to describe what they've seen, typically citing confidentiality agreements . Quiet: Blue Origin's presence in Van Horn, Texas, is minimal . In a Sept. 22, 2014 file photo, U.S. Rep. Filemon Vela, left, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk, center, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry turn the first shovel-full of sand at the groundbreaking ceremony for the SpaceX launch pad at Boca Chica Beach, Texas . Company: A SpaceX rocket is seen here at Cape Canaveral, Florida, in April 2015 . Bezos' love of space originated in Texas in the 1960s when his family moved to Houston, which dubbed itself 'Space City USA.' 'For me, space is something that I have been in love with since I was 5 years old,' Bezos, 51, said in a September interview with The Washington Post, which he purchased in 2013. 'I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the surface of the moon, and I guess it imprinted me.' Over the last decade, he has bought at least seven ranches, totaling 1,900 square miles, near the Texas-New Mexico border and Guadalupe Mountains National Park. 'It's very secretive out there,' said Maricel Gonzalez, chief appraiser for the Culberson County Appraisal District. She declined to describe it, citing a nondisclosure agreement. A UPS driver who recently emerged from the compound also declined to talk. Nuny Morriss, a Van Horn city council member and FedEx delivery driver, said the site includes a 'big warehouse-looking building and some offices ... But they don't let us go around in the back.' Blue Origin's presence in Van Horn is minimal. Morriss recalled word getting out a few years ago about a scheduled launch. Traffic at the local airstrip suggested that VIPs were coming in, and local officials were eager to join them. 'No one in town got invited,' Morriss said. By contrast, SpaceX is frequently in the headlines thanks to its nearly $2 billion federal contract. Attempts to reuse booster rockets have been rocky; it's failed three times to land them on a platform off the Florida coast. SpaceX already has a rocket plant near Waco. With more than $15 million in state incentives, it's also building a launch site at Boca Chica Beach, near Brownsville. Musk hopes for at least 12 rocket launches a year, starting late next year. 'The long-term goal is to create technology necessary to take humanity beyond Earth,' said the 43-year-old South Africa native. David Kanipe, a former NASA division chief now teaching at Texas A&M, says Musk and Bezos were cool to his offers of assistance. 'A lot of time these companies, maybe for good reason, they don't really want to use or benefit from the lessons learned from what NASA did for 40 years, 50 years,' Kanipe said. 'I pleaded with them: \"Let us help, use our experience.\" But they have other ideas.' All of the private space businesses have had setbacks, such as Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which lost a spacecraft and a pilot in October over California's Mojave Desert. 'There's just a million ways it can go wrong,' Kanipe said. 'I think it's doable, but it's just going to take a while.'",

Brian Nicol, 32, dived into a swimming pool at a luxury holiday villa in the Costa del Sol, where he was staying with friends, but failed to resurface. His desperate friends dragged Mr Nicol, who was born in Glasgow, out of the water and tried to save him. Brian Nicol, 32 from Glasgow, Scotland, died while staying in a villa in Nueva Andalucia like the one pictured . Police and paramedics arrived shortly after the incident took place around 8.30am on Easter Sunday morning, but Mr Nicol had died. Officers said early evidence suggests his death was a tragic accident, but they will try to establish whether he suffered a blow to the head or a digestion problems which meant he couldn't swim. The group had been on a night out in Marbella after jetting to Spain on Saturday, before returning to the rented villa in Nueva Andalucia to carry on partying around the pool. A post-mortem was due to take place on Monday morning at Malaga's Forensic Medicine Institute. A police spokesman said: 'The incident is still being investigated but all the evidence at this stage is pointing towards the death being the result of a tragic accident.' Mr Nicol is believed to have travelled to Spain with a group of a dozen friends, who rented a villa in the exclusive residential neighbourhood Nueva Andalucia. Mr Nicol is understood to have gone on a night out in Marbella, pictured, in the hours before he died . Sources close to the investigation said they had been told the group had gone out for the evening before returning to the villa to carry on partying around the pool. One said: 'Our understanding is the victim had dived into the pool and swum underwater two or three times during the night without any problem but failed to surface the last time he jumped in. 'Although he appears to have drowned, it's too early at this stage to say why it happened.' Forensic experts are expected to examine whether the dead man suffered a blow to the head or digestion problems which caused stomach cramps and may have led to him drowning. An investigating judge has been put in charge of a routine judicial probe into the incident. A spokesman for paramedics involved in trying to revive Mr Nicol said: 'We received a call at 8.40am on Sunday and found a foreign man lying by the pool when we arrived. Paramedics tried to revive him but could do nothing to save him. 'An investigation into the death is now underway.' The group has only arrived in the Costa del Sol, an area popular with British tourists, for a holiday on Saturday . Nueva Andalucia, the area where the tragedy happened, is a favourite of well-heeled British expats and holidaymakers. It is a short drive from the millionaire playground paradise of Puerto Banus and boasts several high-quality golf courses. Max Clifford owns a luxury apartment near to one of the courses Sean Connery was once a regular at. Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan also owns a holiday home in the upmarket residential area sandwiched between the Mediterranean and Marbella's famous La Concha mountain.",

Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma to the head in August 2013 following a savage attack on a reservation in Saskatchewan. A 10-year-old boy, identified in court documents as L.T., reportedly admitted to killing Lee Bonneau and crushing his head after initially blaming a stranger for the slaying. Slain: Lee Allan Bonneau was 6 years old when in August 2013 he was attacked by a 10-year-old boy and beaten to death with a rock and a stick . Brief life: Lee was pronounced dead from severe head injuries four hours after he went missing in Saskatchewan, Canada, while in the care of his foster mother . Tribute: A collage created by Lee's biological family celebrating his short, troubled life . On Thursday, a coroner's jury in Regina heard how the underage suspect ran to his friends after the attack on Bonneau telling them he had witnessed a murder, reported National Post. The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also excited, telling his friends how a 'big guy' had struck Lee with a stick three times, pushed him down an embankment and then bashed him with a rock. L.T. then changed his story, according to Thursday's hearing, saying the he was the one who killed the 6-year-old. He then pleaded with his pals, 'Don't tell on me,' because he was afraid of being jailed. During an interview with investigators a day after Lee Bonneau's slaying August 21, 2013, L.T. reverted back to his original version of events, telling Royal Canadian Mounted Police that a 'big person' committed the crime. The 10-year-old named the purported killer and told law enforcement officials that he even walked up to the man and asked him what he was doing. 'I'm just killing a little boy,' L.T. quoted the man as saying. Police later questioned the person identified by L.T. and cleared him of any wrongdoing. On the evening of August 21, 2013, Lee Bonneau accompanied his foster mother, Mary Ramstead, to a bingo game at the Kahkewistahaw First Nation hall. At around 8pm, Lee stepped outside the bingo venue to buy snacks and never returned. He was last seen playing with some dogs and walking in the company of an older boy, later identified as 10-year-old L.T. More than two hours after his disappearance, Lee was found critically injured in a remote field more than half a mile from the bingo hall. A coroner's inquest has heard how a 10-year-old boy named L.T. attacked the younger child, pictured here as an infant on the evening of August 21, 2013 on a reservation . Family troubles: Lee was removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk (pictured) just two and a half months before his murder . Lee is pictured here with his birth father, Dave Bonneau. Child servers reportedly refused to release the 6-year-old into his parent's care . The 6-year-old was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries at around midnight. Forensic pathologist Dr Shaun Ladhman determined that Lee died from blunt force trauma to the left side of the head after suffering multiple skull fractures. In his testimony at the coroner's inquest Thursday, Ladhman compared the boy's injuries to those seen in high-speed car collisions or a three-story fall. Bonneau also had bite marks on his body. Because of his young age, 10-year-old L.T. has not been charged with Lee Bonneau's murder. Global News reported that Saskatchewan\u2019s children\u2019s advocate determined the underage killer had severe behavioral issues and likely required constant supervision. RCMP Cpl. Donna Zawislak testified court that when officers came to the child's house and said that Lee Bonneau has died, the 10-year-old did not react. The following day, L.T. sat down for a forensic interview, saying he had been a witness to the killing, not the perpetrator. When asked about the blood stains on his clothes and shoes, the 10-year-old blamed it on a nosebleed. The child had a history of troubling behavior, including a break-in where he killed a pregnant dog and her puppies, which had been cut out of the animal's body. Lee had been removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk, just two and a half months before his death citing concerns related to his verbal skills and behavioral problems. Violent end: A pathologist testified that 6-year-old Lee suffered injuries often observed in high-speed car collisions. He had multiple skull fractures and bite marks on his body . Lies:\u00a0The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also, telling his friends after the killing how a 'big guy' had struck Lee . Unpunished:\u00a0L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age . During the coroner\u2019s inquest, Ms Merk testified that a social worker became alarmed when she confided in her that she has been struggling with depression and had suicidal thoughts. On August 1, child services placed Lee with Mary Ramstead's family on a temporary basis. Three weeks later, the 6-year-old was murdered while in the care of his foster mother. L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age. The goal of the coroner's inquest is to determine the circumstances of the murder and make recommendations to prevent similar tragedies going forward.",

After a low-key day campaigning in his constituency in Doncaster on Saturday, the Labour leader spent all of Sunday and Monday with his family. At the same time, David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon was prominent on the campaign trail.

First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP Nicola Sturgeon met with residents of Livingston, west Lothian . A Labour source told the Telegraph: \u2018We understand that there are different views but we took a simple decision: the more people see a man with the energy, principles and the ideas to change Britain the better it is. \u2018And the more opportunity we can have to speak directly with the public the better it is. \u2018You can gameplay 100 different scenarios but if someone offers us 90 minutes of airtime to talk to the public, if he has a chance to talk to millions of people, we should take it.\u2019 Mr Miliband this morning used his first campaign appearance since Saturday to launch a fresh attack on the Tory record on the NHS. The Labour leader said A&E waiting times had soared because the Government had failed to keep GP surgeries open at evenings and weekends. Addressing an audience in Bristol, he said: \u2018The NHS cannot go forward if queues to see your GP are stretching backwards and I believe that Britain can do a lot better than people waiting day after day for basic healthcare.

There is no point of trying to hurt him as he hurt because it can't be done. All we can do, all you can do is make the best choice.\" Bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from: death, or life in prison without any possibility of parole. \"We are asking you to punish Jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life.\" Showing the court a photo of the federal Supermax prison in Colorado, Bruck said: . \"This is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but aren't anymore. ... He goes here and he's forgotten. No more spotlight, like the death penalty brings. \"No interviews with the news media, no autobiography, no messages from Jahar on the Internet. No nothing. \"No martyrdom. Just years and years of punishment, day after day, as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did. \"The evidence will show that if you sentence Jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did, you'll both punish him and protect society.\" Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell, 29; Lingzi Lu, 23; Martin Richard, 8; and Sean Collier, 26. In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison, jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors, such as his relative youth, mental health and family background, and whether or not he is remorseful. He has shown no emotion as he sits in court, and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead. Last week, federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony, including an array of images showing the victims as happy, active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion, screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant, where Richard and Lu died. Lead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was 26, died in a gunbattle with Watertown, Massachusetts, police three days after the bombings. Clarke's colleague, Bruck, began that narrative in his opening statement by noting, \"The man who conceived, planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left. \"He was 19, nearly 20. But he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer. And an age when people make horribly bad, destructive decisions. What each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor.\" Bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing Tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point. \"I could almost hear you gasp\" when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims, Bruck said. \"It turned out that shocking gesture wasn't quite as advertised. \"What did he mean? It meant he was acting as an immature 19-year-old.\" Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend, but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives, who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel, apparently do not include his parents, who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15, 2013, bombings. Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang, a sociologist, to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed. Under federal law, the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life. The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings.",

Now, in honor of the lucky reunion with their ring, Mr and Mrs Castillo have renewed their vows - and even asked Mr Roark, 22, to serve as their 'padrino de anillo', or 'godfather of the ring' for the ceremony, which took place in the same town as their original honeymoon.

Daniel was the \u201cpadrino de anillo\u201c, \u201cgodfather of the ring\u201d, returning the wedding band to the couple and having it placed on Martin\u2019s finger [and bringing] closure after a two-year journey. 'Jessica and Martin renewed their vows, embraced their \u201cangel\u201d and celebrated their love, the success of #thelostweddingband campaign and the goodhearted young man behind it (sic). 'Jessica and Martin also shared a preview of the sequel to this story, they are expecting their first child and will name it after Daniel! 'New friends, new adventures and a fresh start with the ring they thought was gone forever, a fairytale come true and a \u201chappily ever after\u201d for all.' Sun-filled fun: The couple returned to Playa del Carmen, in Mexico, where they had their honeymoon, in order to renew their vows . Special role: Mr Roark was invited to serve as the couple's 'padrino de anillo' or 'godfather of the ring' Lucky find: Mr Roark, an enthusiastic scuba diver, discovered the ring in September 2014, more than a year after it was lost . Meaningful: The ring is engraved with\u00a0'Jessica 16-02-13 TYYJCEM'. TYYJCEM stands for 'Tu y yo juntos contra el mundo' or 'You and I together against the world' After discovering the lost wedding band, which been lying under seven feet of water for over a year, while scuba diving on holiday in September 2014, Mr Roark sent out a message on his Facebook page in the hopes of returning the ring, which is engraved with 'Jessica 16-02-13 TYYJCEM'. TYYJCEM stands for 'Tu y yo juntos contra el mundo' or 'You and I together against the world'. The Facebook campaign quickly attracted attention and support from hundreds of thousands of people around the globe, sparking a viral social media search for the couple - who were eventually told about Mr Roark's efforts by Mrs Castillo's cousin. Although Mr Roark admits he was slightly skeptical about the legitimacy of the cousin's claims - he had already received more than 50 messages from people falsely claiming that the ring belonged to them - he was soon convinced after she sent him a series of images of Mr Castillo wearing the band on his wedding day. 'We had no idea that someone was looking for us,' Mr Castillo said at the time. 'You have no idea what this means.' Guardian: Mr Castillo described Mr Roark as the couple's 'angel' True love: The couple were overjoyed to be reunited with the wedding band . Mr Roark admitted when he first found the ring that he had no idea whether its owner would actually want it to be returned - or whether it had been cast into the water on purpose, in a willing attempt to ensure it remained lost. When he launched his initial campaign on\u00a0Facebook, Mr Roark posted a picture of the ring, before writing: 'OK, so while scuba diving around Playa Reef, Playa Del Carmen last week, I happened to find this ring. 'Unfortunately there is no way for me to know whether it was lost or intentionally thrown into the ocean. 'Assuming it was not the latter, I'd like to find the owner so I can send it to them.' 'If you know a couple who was married on February 16th, 2013, who lost a wedding band (likely while diving) near Playa Del Carmen Mexico, please have them contact me at thelostweddingband@yahoo.com. Precious: Mr Roark posted this picture of the ring on his Facebook page shortly after finding it . Helping hand: Mr Roark was scuba diving off the coast of Playa del Carmen in Mexico when he found the wedding ring on the sea bed . Found: A cousin of Mrs Castillo's (center) messaged Mr Roark to tell him the ring belonged to her relaitve, who had lost it during their honeymoon in February 2013 . 'If not, please take a second to share this. Let's make some social media magic happen!' In another post he added: 'I'm shocked at how much support the search for the wedding band owner has received!' The story was even shared on George Takei's Facebook wall, boost the search's signal, with Roark stating that along brought in 125,000 more shares. 'Sadly the owner has not been found yet, but my hope for humanity was certainly restored!' 'Always remember, even in this crazy world, there are a lot of kind people.'",

Jerry Moon's family only discovered the devastating blunder when they opened the casket to say their final\u00a0goodbyes and found the other body wrapped in a plastic bag. While the body of the loving father - who was terrified of cremation - was accidentally incinerated at Dahl McVicker Funeral Home\u00a0in Kelso, Washington State. The family of Jerry Moon, pictured with his wife Janice, were distraught when they found another man's body in his coffin . A lawsuit filed by the family claims the Brown Mortuary put the body of 97-year-old Robert Petitclerc in the coffin by mistake . The family is now seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress. Chronically ill in his final years, Mr Moon began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013. The 72-year-old railroad conductor had paid $4,655\u00a0to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court. The prepaid services also included embalming, a funeral and a graveside service. After he passed away at a hospice in Longview on October 13,\u00a0the funeral home was responsible for transporting his body to the Brown Mortuary for a burial. But Shawn Briggs, an attorney representing Moon's family, said his identification bracelet had been placed on another body. Jerry Moon, pictured with at Weyerhaeuser Railroad where he worked for 28 years, was chronically ill in his final years and had began arranging for his funeral 16 years before his death in 2013 . Born in Chehalis, Mr Moon, a father and stepfather to six, spent most of his life in Southwest Washington . According to family members, Mr Moon's funeral was a touching goodbye to the man they loved. At the end of the service, they opened the casket. But they were horrified to find the body of\u00a0Robert Petitclerc - dressed in Jerry Moon's clothes and with a picture of Moon's wife tucked under the pillow in the coffin. Plastic had been wrapped round his head and face. 'This makes me feel like he was treated as a number, not a person,' daughter Cheryl Moon told KIROTV.com\u00a0at the time. 'I turned around and said to myself three times, 'That's not him, that's not him, that's not him,' son Randy Moon told the station. The mistake is all the more surprising as Mr Moon was 72 and bald while Mr Petitclerc was 97 and had a full head of hair, the lawsuit said. 'It was horrifying,' Mr Briggs told the Seattle Pi. The family, who had been given a bill of $8,834 by Brown Mortuary for the service, would only later learn that the mix up at the funeral home meant Mr Moon's had been cremated. Mr Moon, pictured with wife Janice, had paid $4,655 to be buried in a family plot in Chehalis, Washington, according to a lawsuit filed in Lewis County Superior Court . Grieving: Moon's son Randy says he believes his father is in Heaven, regardless of who was in the casket . Sadly the discovery was even more upsetting for the family as Mr Moon had always been scared of cremation. 'He was afraid of cremation,' Mr Briggs added. 'He had religious beliefs that were inconsistent with cremation.' Born in Chehalis, Mr Moon, a father and stepfather to six, had spent most of his life in Southwest Washington. Brown Mortuary initially claimed the body was Mr Moon, but later admitted he had been cremated on October 17, 2013, by mistake, according to the lawsuit. The mortuary later sent a $92.72 refund check to Janice Moon. Relatives have now filed a lawsuit against the two mortuaries that mishandled Mr Moon's remains. It says the mortuary acted fraudulently and with malice in its handling of Jerry Moon's body and conspired to cover-up the fact that Mr Moon had been mistakenly cremated. The mortuary is part of a funeral service chain owned by Texas-based Service Corporation International. Representative Kim Tarleton declined to comment on the allegations, saying it would be 'inappropriate to share any details about this situation.'",

Violet Pietrok, who lives in Portland, Oregon, was born with frontonasal dysplasia, a malformation of the face and head that is developed in the womb. It is so rare only 100 cases have been reported. The condition caused a widening of Violet's facial features, specifically with her nose, which had no cartilage, and the space between her eyes. She also had a large central cleft in her face and a growth over her left eye. Two-year-old Violet Pietrok, from Portland, Oregon,\u00a0is now smiling, laughing and dancing again six months after a major surgery, aided by 3D printing, helped reshape her face . Violet was born with frontonasal dysplasia, a congenital malformation that widened her facial features, specifically her nose and the space between her eyes . Violet's eyes were originally so far apart her vision was like that of a bird of prey's, her mother told the\u00a0New York Times. Plastic surgeon-in-chief Dr. John Meara of Boston Children's Hospital spent months preparing for Violet's surgery, specifically with molds of her skull that were made using a 3D printer. Meara made about five different models from the time of Violet's first birthday to leading up to her October 2014 operation. He said he used them both to see how Violet was growing and developing, and to practice the cuts and incisions he knew he was going to have to make before he even stepped into an operating room. 'This isn't like free throw practice,' he told the Statesman Journal. 'You can't just go out and try and if you miss, try again. The molds allowed Meara and the other surgeons to see what possible problems could arise with certain methods. They also gave the doctors a fuller picture of what they were working with - one that was even better than what they'd be able to see during the operation. Meara used the molds during the almost seven-hour surgery, and referenced them when the doctors tried to find solutions for a complication, according to\u00a0ABC News. Violet's new face allows her to be just as expressive as any of the other children her age . Violet's mother Alicia Taylor said that it took a 'little while' for Violet to get back to normal as she spent six weeks recovering from the operation in the hospital and adjusting to her new vision perception. 'It's all about perspective, cause it gets hard,' she said in a Boston Children's Hospital video. 'You just kind of have to see the finish line and keep and eye on where you're going and why you're doing this.' Plastic surgeon Dr. John Meara of Boston Children's Hospital spent months preparing for Violet's surgery with molds of her skull that were made using a 3D printer . There were physical complications, one which sent Violet back to the operating room, as well. It took more than three months for her scar, which threatened to unzip, to heal. But her stitches were finally removed at the end of February, just in time for Violet's second birthday. And she has been smiling the whole way through. Taylor said the only time her daughter, who she said is 'taking it all in stride', isn't smiling now is if she's sleeping or throwing a typical toddler fit. Even with the surgery, Taylor said Violet 'doesn't see herself as different'. The only thing that bothered her about her stitches was that she couldn't wear ribbons in her hair. But Taylor admits that as much as the family loves Violet's new face, they do find themselves missing her old face as well. 'I was so worried that they were going to take her and she was going to be unrecognizable,' she told ABC News. 'I miss that little face because you love it.' But Taylor said the surgery, and the cosmetic touch-ups that will occur once Violet reaches kindergarten, will be worth it in the long-run. 'This will make a huge impact with her quality of life and the way people perceive her,' she said. As for now, Taylor hopes that by sharing Violet's story she can help people become more aware of the condition - and hopefully change the way they react to it as well. Even with the surgery, Taylor said Violet 'doesn't see herself as different'. The only thing that bothered her about her stitches was that she couldn't wear ribbons in her hair .",

The spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of multibillion pound commercial spacecraft, which Nasa hope will be in operation by 2017. Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks on GroPro cameras . Nasa recently signed a contract with commercial spaceflight companies SpaceX and Boeing with the intention to produce craft capable of transporting astronauts to the ISS. The clip was recorded to give the future ISS workers an idea of what they can expect when they go into space to maintain the commercial spacecraft. In the footage Virts and Wilmore can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system for the future docking spacecraft.

The astronauts can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. The two men also set up antennas and routed 4000 feet (1219m) of power and data cables.

Nasa has recently relied on Russian Soyuz capsules taking astronauts to ISS to carry out maintenance work since its space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011 after 30 years\u2019 service. But at a cost of nearly \u00a350 million per seat, it has not been a financially viable solution. Nasa now hope that their deals with SpaceX and Boeing can cut the cost of their future transportation fees. The International Space Station is a habitable artificial satellite in low earth orbit.

A video shows Officer Michael Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at 50-year-old Walter Scott as Scott has his back to him and is running away. Scott, who was unarmed, was struck five times. Timeline of events . The FBI is investigating, and once again, a shooting involving police has sparked national outrage. \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,\" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. The mayor spoke at the same news conference that was repeatedly interrupted by protesters, who chanted: \"No justice! No peace!\" They called for Mayor Keith Summey to step down. Summey told reporters that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt who shouted, \"This is what democracy looks like!\" Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. \"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,\" Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said. \"I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature.\" An autopsy of Scott showed that he \"sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,\" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" The North Charleston Police department was not legally obligated to but chose to hand the case over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, according to a news release from Scarlett A. Wilson, the Ninth Judicial Circuit solicitor. Though Wilson said she is subject to rules that limit what she can say publicly, she stated: \"My role is to hold accountable those who harm others unlawfully, regardless of profession. This office does not dictate nor comment upon police policy, training and procedure. I am, however, deeply concerned when those who are sworn to serve and protect violate the public's trust.\" Slager pulled Scott over on Saturday morning for a broken taillight, authorities have said. The beginning of the video shows the two men standing close to each other. Any words exchanged between Scott and Slager are not audible on the released tape. It's also unclear what happened before Scott started to run away, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take his weapon. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" Slager said, according to police reports. \"He took my Taser.\" Before the officer started firing his gun, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced the officer had lied, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,\" Scott said. The video shows Walter Scott attempting to run away. His back is to the officer, and he is a few yards away when the officer raises his gun and fires. A man walking to work on Saturday recorded the video and provided it to the family. That man, Feidin Santana, spoke to NBC's Lester Holt. He said there had been a struggle between the two men on the ground before he started recording, and that the officer was in control. When asked how he felt about the fact that Slager has been charged with murder, Santana said that \"no one can feel happy.\" \"He has his family and Mr. Scott also has his family. But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. And, you know, you pay for your decisions in this life,\" he told NBC's Holt. \"Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that.\" If convicted of murder, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? \"People are upset, people are pointing out how wrong the officer was for gunning down Mr. Scott,\" South Carolina State Rep. Justin Bamberg said as he stood alongside Anthony Scott on Wednesday. #WalterScott received 11,000 mentions on Twitter in just one hour Wednesday; 243,000 mentions in 24 hours. #RIPWalterScott is also trending, as is #MichaelSlager. Bamberg said he hasn't heard of anyone acting out violently to protest the shooting. He and Scott stressed they don't want that to happen. \"Things are in play now, and this officer is in the process of being prosecuted,\" Bamberg said, imploring anyone listening to him speak on CNN: \"We ask that you let the justice process run its course.\" That message was echoed by Walter Scott's mother, who said she feels \"forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son.\" \"He was a loving son, a loving father. He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son,\" Judy Scott told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The Justice Department said it would \"take appropriate action in light of the evidence and developments in the state case.\" \"The South Carolina Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation concurrent with the S.C. Law Enforcement Division and are providing aid as necessary to the state investigation,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the South Carolina U.S. Attorney's Office will work with the FBI in the investigation.\" Whether Scott's civil rights were violated will be part of the Justice Department's investigation. In the meantime, Slager remains behind bars. He was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, CNN affiliate WCIV reported. Slager will remain in custody unless a circuit court sets his bond, a court spokesman told CNN. The court has not set a date for that hearing. According to WCIV, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. But Aylor later told CNN that he no longer represents the officer. It's not clear whether Slager has found a new attorney.

Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, befriended girls  and then \u2018hooked\u2019 them with alcohol - normally vodka - in an attempt to make them \u2018compliant\u2019 to sexual advances. The 43-year-old married businessman, who lived in the city with his wife and children, would pursue his interest \u2018away from his home and family\u2019, using his restaurant as a \u2018focal point\u2019. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls . Khubaib - who was convicted of the charges against him by a jury at the Old Bailey in five hours - had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls, the trial heard. The father of five groomed vulnerable under-age girls by giving them money, gifts or cigarettes before plying them with alcohol. Following a trial he was found guilty of forcing a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him and nine counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation involving girls aged from 12 to 15 between November 2010 and January 2013. His South African friend Manase Motaung, 32, was cleared of raping a 16-year-old and seven trafficking charges, involving six girls. Khubaib's conviction brings the total number of people to be convicted under Operation Erle to ten, of which five are of Pakistani origin. Khubaib was remanded in custody and warned he faces a long spell behind bars when he is sentenced on May 15. Eatery: Khubaib, who lived in Peterborough with his wife and children, would pursue his interest 'away from his home and family', using his restaurant (above) as a 'focal point' Judge Peter Rook QC told him he had been convicted 'of a very serious offence of a rape on a young girl... having plied her with vodka'. He added:\u00a0\u2018You have also been convicted of no less than nine trafficking offences in relation to under-age girls who you were deliberately plying with vodka so that you could take advantage of them, knowing they craved vodka so you could exploit them sexually. The Cambridgeshire Police investigation codenamed Operation Erle has led to a string of convictions for sex offences against girls in the Peterborough area. \u2018You must know the only sentence is a custodial sentence - and a long sentence.\u2019 The jury was deliberating for less than a day before it reached its verdicts. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls, from Peterborough, with a couple from Lincolnshire and Rutland. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the girls were vulnerable because of their age, background, circumstances or unsettled schooling and Khubaib pretended to be their \u2018friend and helper\u2019. Khubaib, who also ran a lettings agency, would drive girls to flats in his 4x4 and, once there, they would be groomed for sex by being \u2018plied with alcohol and entertained by himself and his friends\u2019. Khubaib raped a 14-year-old girl in August 2007 by forcing her to perform oral sex on him after she was given alcohol and then \u2018rewarded\u2019 with \u00a35, the court heard. The jury heard details of the trafficking allegations. Khubaib would buy one girl and her friends McDonald's meals and tobacco, as well as giving her small sums of money and a \u00a340 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday, the court heard. He told the girl he wanted her to be his wife, saying that he would \u2018choose her over everyone else\u2019, while he told another 15-year-old she had beautiful eyes, the jury was told. When she rebuffed him, saying he was too old for her, he was said to have replied: \u2018Age doesn't matter.\u2019 Khubaib allegedly offered another girl \u00a360, telling her: \u2018You make me happy, I'll give you money.\u2019 Two weeks later he allegedly increased the offer to \u00a390. The girl refused. In January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said. The girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away. Later that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14. Khubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped. Motaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a \u2018victim-led\u2019 inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. Nine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. Two years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12. Separately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. Wendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: \u2018What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.\u2019 The two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. Following the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: \u2018I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.\u2019 He added that the investigation was more than two years old, and \u2018I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved\u2019. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a \u2018victim-led\u2019 inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. A police spokesman said: \u2018We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. 'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.\u2019 A number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian/Pakistani men. Khubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then \u2018hooked\u2019 with alcohol in an attempt to make them \u2018compliant\u2019 to sexual advances . A mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter \u2018kick-started\u2019 the police investigation into Khubaib. The teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough. She saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police. Khubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a \u2018persistent and almost predatory interest\u2019 in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard. The girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial \u2018worse than she expected\u2019 after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom. She said: \u2018We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying \"I'm stupid, I'm silly\". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls. \u2018Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that. \u2018There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.\u2019 The woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a \u2018big impact\u2019 on her daughter. She explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school. She said: \u2018After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'",

Rodgers failed to make it as a professional footballer despite leaving Northern Ireland for England at the age of 16 and training with the Reading youth team. The Reds manager believes the memory of missing out on a first team spot despite being promised one has helped him to handle Liverpool's young players. Brendan Rodgers takes positives from his experience of not making it as a professional footballer . 20-year-old star Raheem Sterling (left) has flourished under the guidance of Rodgers . Speaking of his experience, Rodgers told Barclays: 'I felt as a young player I didn't get the chance. I was a talented youth player in Northern Ireland. 'I came to England, to Reading when I was 16. I was captain of the youth team and was then in the first team squad. 'The manager at the time asked me to play in the reserve game on the Monday to get some game time then look to make my first team debut on the Wednesday against Fulham.

That hit me probably harder than it should have done. 'I felt that from that moment that I was probably never going to get the chance.' The 42-year-old believes those experiences as a youngster have helped him to nurture the talents of the likes of Sterling, who has already made 120 appearances for Liverpool at the tender age of 20. Rodgers (centre) described himself as a 'talented youth player', but he failed to make the grade . Rodgers (middle row, second up) was on the books at Reading where he was captain of the youth team . Sterling made his Liverpool debut in August, 2012 as Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Norwich City . Rodgers added: 'But those negative experiences, I was able to turn them into a positive in my life and in my work. 'I could help young players and prepare them. If I told young players they were going to play, they would play. 'There comes a time when you have to let them go. Sometimes you never know until they're in the arena. They just want that opportunity.' Jordan Ibe looks to have a bright future at Liverpool as Rodgers looks to give youth a chance .",

We Britons certainly do love to keep things local, as over three quarters of us (80 per cent) go crackers for cheddar, crowning it our favourite cheese variety. Least favourite cheeses, according to a new survey, are Greek feta, French Camembert and American cream cheese. And while the French are renowned for their love of the stinky stuff, we are not far behind, with the average Briton eating their way through four servings a week. The research, which was conducted by pickle brand Branston also revealed that a surprising one in four cheese fanatics (26 per cent) admit to eating melted cheese with everything. A third of Brits (30 per cent) say they can't enjoy cheese without a dollop of their favourite pickle while almost three quarters admitted to reaching out for a cheese sandwich when feeling peckish. In fact, three in ten office workers tuck into cheese sandwiches for lunch each work day without fail. If we're not putting slices in our sandwiches, one in ten of us are eating whole blocks of cheese in one sitting. Our second favourite is mozzarella with almost two in five (38 per cent) enjoying the ever versatile soft Italian cheese. Close behind in third place is traditional red Leicester (32 per cent).

This is the equivalent of eating over 1,000 identical cheese sandwiches. Commenting on our attraction to repetition, food psychologist, Greg Tucker, who worked with Lurpak said: 'This research demonstrates that the repetition of eating the same food every day can provide reassurance and stability. 'However we all have an innate desire for exploration and would benefit from shaking things up.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n'Double wife killer' Harold Henthorn wants to use a $1.5million life insurance pay out from a policy taken out on his second wife to pay for the defense in his trial for her murder. Henthorn was charged with the murder of second wife, Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have since reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife some 20 years earlier. Both women died in 'freak accidents' to which Henthorn, 59, was the sole witness. Dr Toni Jill Bertolet plunged 140 ft to her death shortly before their 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with Henthorn in a remote stretch of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. First wife, Lynn Rishell, was crushed to death under Henthorn's jeep when, according to Henthorn, the jack gave way as she reached beneath the vehicle for a lug nut while changing a flat tire at night on an isolated highway near the couple's Colorado home. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Henthorn was charged with the murder of Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife, Lynn Rishell, some 20 years earlier . Lynn Rishell - Henthorn's first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn's Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark . In both cases Henthorn was the sole beneficiary of the women's substantial life insurance policies totalling $500,000 in the case of his first wife and $4.5million in the case of his second. Now, newly filed documents have revealed that he is fighting for a $1.5million pay out from the policy taken out in July 2001 on the grounds that he needs the money to pay for his attorney for the forthcoming murder trial scheduled to begin next month. The documents, filed yesterday and seen by Daily Mail Online, are part of a bitter civil case being fought in Douglas County .They note that, just weeks before he is due to stand trial, Henthorn is 'focused solely on his own desire to have the insurance proceeds disbursed to himself without any meaningful process.' They go onto state: 'Should Henthorn truly be able to substantiate an inability to afford counsel in the criminal matter, those matters are properly addressed in the criminal case pending in this District.' They point out: 'The Colorado Supreme Court has said: \"Killers cannot receive life insurance proceeds from their victims\" and insurers cannot disburse proceeds \"prematurely\", \u2026.when law enforcement is still investigating or a prosecution is pending.' The next named beneficiary is his nine-year-old daughter with Dr Bertolet, Hayley. Dr Bertolet died on 29 September, 2012. The autopsy report, dated 18 December 2012, stated that she 'died as the result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff while hiking.' It concluded, 'homicide cannot be excluded.' But when her husband submitted a claim for the life insurance death benefit policy almost exactly a year later, on September 27, 2013 he gave her cause of death as 'Accidental Fall.' At the time Henthorn was unaware that he was already the subject of an FBI investigation that lasted two years and scrutinized every aspect of the widower's life, culminating in his arrest last November. But despite facing murder charges Henthorn has not relinquished the claim his claim to the substantial insurance pay out on his wife's death. Shockingly, not only is he fighting for the pay out to fund his own defense, documents filed in a separate motion in March show that he fought his late wife's family to have funds from Dr Bertolet's estate released into his possession. Last February the District Court of Douglas County, Colorado found in Dr Bertolet's family's favor and barred Henthorn from accessing his late wife's estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an 'imminent risk of substantial harm..to [its] financial interests.' Both \u2018freak accidents\u2019 occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn, pictured here with his first wife, Rishell, told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Henthorn and Lynn Rishell when he was a new geology graduate from Virginia. The couple moved to Colorado, where after 12 years of marriage, she died in a 'freak accident', now said to be murder . Henthorn (left), pictured with Grace (center) and Lynn (right) Rishell,\u00a0was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident . Henthorn attempted to overturn this decision as recently as December and only finally failed when a court denied him access to the funds and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife's estate. In March Daily Mail Online revealed that, in 2009 Henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law, Grace Rishell. Grace was going through a divorce and 'concerned for her financial stability,' when she initially agreed to Henthorn's suggestion that she take out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. According to prosecutors in Dr Bertolet's murder case, 'the evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell.' But she had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. Yet unbeknownst to her, 'her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well,' with Henthorn making payments on the policy until December 2012 and listing himself as the sole beneficiary. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in RIshell. But the very fact of its existence raises the specter that Henthorn had Rishell in his sights as a third potential victim. Henthorn was denied bail by US District Attorney Judge Kathleen Latoyfa who described him as a 'danger' and said, 'there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second.' She pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was 'hiding funds.' Henthorn's trial is scheduled to begin in September. He has entered a plea of not guilty.",

Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen described the graphic video as the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' he had ever seen likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. He says the footage shows several men surrounding an incapacitated woman on a beach chair. Delonte Martistee, 22, of Bainbridge, Georgia, and Ryan Calhoun, 23, of Mobile, Alabama, were charged with sexual battery for the incident believed to have occurred between March 10 and 12. Delonte Martistee, 22 (left), and Ryan Calhoun, 23 (right), have been officially suspended from Troy University in the wake of sexual assault claims . The two were arrested this week after police uncovered cellphone footage of the two of them assaulting an unconscious girl at the Spinnaker Beach Club in Panama City, Florida last month . The video allegedly shows hundreds of people gathered around the girl as the men violate her while she lays on a beach chair. The unidentified victim believes she was drugged before the incident. Above, the beach behind Spinnaker is seen on April 12, 2015 . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case and additional arrests are expected. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun, of Mobile, Alabama pictured above in a picture from Facebook. Officials say they more arrests are expected . Above, a view of the Spinnaker Beach Club during a spring break party . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' The investigation related to the incident is ongoing.",

Indeed, many women make common mistakes every single day that could lead to their skin ageing faster. FEMAIL called on the best dermatologists in the business to shed some light on the classic mistakes women make and to share their vital tips for ensuring you're getting the most from your skincare regime. Scroll down for video . Many women spends hundreds of pounds a month on expensive skincare products but make common mistakes every single day that could lead to their skin ageing faster . DON'T ONLY USE SPF ON HOLIDAY . Perhaps one of the most common misconceptions women have is that you only need to use an SPF in boiling climates. Wrong. In fact, an SPF should be an essential part of your daily skincare regime, says Dr Mike Bell, Skincare Scientific Advisor for Boots UK. 'Protecting your skin from the sun and environmental stress is really important, particularly if you want to proactively delay the signs of ageing,' he said. Even when there isn't a ray of sunshine in the sky, your skin is still at harm. UVA  rays can penetrate glass, meaning your skin is at risk from ageing through your car windows or even when sitting at your desk. Dr. Adam Geyer, Kiehl\u2019s Consulting Dermatologist, concurs. He said: 'Apply a broad spectrum, high SPF sunscreen before heading out the door each morning, with reapplication every 2-3 hours during peak outdoor exposure.' APPLY CREAMS IN THE CORRECT ORDER . Another simple way to make your products work harder (particularly if you've spent a small fortune on them) is applying them in the right order. Indeed, products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams. Products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams . Those creams with heavier consistencies can actually stop the lighter ones from penetrating the skin and doing the job they've been designed to do - practically making them redundant. NEVER SLEEP WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN . This is a common mistake copious amounts of women make - but one that can easily be rectified. Many people have forehead breakouts due to the oil clogging up their pores. Always tie your hair back loosely before you get into bed. By sleeping with your hair and fringe down, the oils from your locks (not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you've used in the day) are kept well away from your face. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS A TONER . Cleanse, tone and moisturise is a mantra for millions of women, sold by the beauty industry as a sure-fire way to fresh, glowing skin. But while the benefits of cleansing and moisturising are obvious, part of the routine is simply habit for many women - and few question its benefits: toning. Toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime, leaving skin dewy and pores closed. According to market intelligence firm Mintel, one in five of us uses toners daily. But many women who religiously apply this classic skincare product don't realise toners can include harsh ingredients such as alcohol, which can dry out even the most oily skin, and parabens, which have been shown to induce allergic reactions. 'The alcohol found in toners can be a trigger for rosacea, increase the risk of breakouts in acne-prone skin or exacerbate sensitivity,' reveals cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting. This means that regular use of toners could leave the skin irritated, inflamed and vulnerable to environmental damage. Dr Bunting believes that even if your toner doesn't harm your skin, its place in your beauty regime may be redundant. 'Soap used to leave behind residues, but today's cleansers are designed to rinse clean and don't disturb the skin's natural equilibrium in the same way, so there's no need to use a toner.' Dr Harold Lancer, author of Kim Kardashian's favourite book, Younger, comments: 'Most skincare regimens include a toner step, but not everyone needs one. 'Toners are primarily formulated to return the skin to its natural ph level. The ph is the balance between acidity and alkalinity in your body. The skin on the face is at its healthiest when it is slightly acidic. Acid prohibits bacterial growth that can contribute to acne and helps maintain the skin\u2019s barrier function, keeping moisture in and harmful substances out. Alkaline skin is more prone to lines, wrinkles and sun damage. 'All that would seem to make toner a must, but if you have relatively normal skin, exfoliate regularly, and use a cleanser that does not strip your skin of its natural moisture, you should be able to maintain a healthy ph level. Lifestyle changes will do the rest.' By sleeping with your hair and fringe down, the oils from your locks (not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you've used in the day) are kept well away from your face . DON'T OVER-CLEANSE . While the key to acne-free skin is squeaky clean skin, you can do more harm than good by over washing your face. You can also over exfoliate by buffing away too much of your top skin layer, which serves as a protective barrier against environmental toxins and sun damage - both of which accelerate the ageing process. Dr. Geoff Genesky, Kiehl\u2019s Head of Laboratory, emphasises that consumers should also be careful to follow product instructions very carefully, especially when using products that have anti-ageing benefits but that can be a bit harsh to the skin's outermost layers. 'Making sure to wear sunscreens when using retinol or alpha hydroxy acid products comes to mind,' he said. 'As does limiting application to once or twice a week in the case of products with high concentrations of acid exfoliating ingredients or cleansers with particularly rough scrub particles.' DON'T USE TOO MUCH PRODUCT - AND DON'T BE LURED BY EXPENSIVE CREAMS . 'Don't be swayed by marketing hype - using the right product for your skin type is key,' advises Emma Leslie, editor at Escentual.com. 'Buying a cult \u00a3120 moisturiser that's optimised for dry skin when your skin is oily means that you won't reap its full benefits, and your skin will start to misbehave. Chat to a professional, they'll be more than happy to point you in the right direction.' Leslie also warns of the dangers of getting carried away and applying too much product. 'Applying more product doesn't mean you'll achieve better results,' she said. 'In fact, applying too much product could overload and irritate the skin, particularly around the sensitive eye area. Apply less product and pay more attention to the way you apply it (many brands will provide a step-by-step specialised application method), and you'll glean greater results.' USE THE RIGHT TECHNIQUES TO APPLY YOUR EYE CREAM . Cammie Cannella, Kiehl\u2019s Vice President of Global Education and Customer Relations, explains another important tip: to be sure that you don\u2019t use too much of any type of product in the eye area, to avoid overwhelming the skin there and potentially exacerbating any puffiness. 'For best results, dispense a very small amount - about the size of a pea - onto your fingertips and dot the product around the orbital bone first, then go back and lightly pat or press the formula into your skin (ideally using the ring finger, which is weakest and therefore the least likely to unnecessarily pull or stretch the delicate skin around the eyes),' she said.",

Warren Sapp made many highlight-reel plays during the course of his Hall of Fame career, but the former NFL star might be better remembered for his off-field exploits thanks to a new video. Sapp was arrested the night after the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona, on a prostitution charge after an\u00a0alleged incident involving two women. In a police video released on Monday, Sapp, 42, cries, cackles and confesses about what exactly went down back on February 2 in the Renaissance Hotel. In the video\u00a0obtained by TMZ, Sapp admits he paid for oral sex and that 'everyone got naked' after he 'put $600 on the table' in his hotel room. The two women who were arrested along with Sapp were Britney Osbourne, 23, and 34-year-old Quying Boyd. Sapp continued: 'We're in the bed and I start taking pictures of the two ladies naked and doing what they're doing. 'So I'm taking pictures because I'm silly like that sometimes.' Scroll down for video \u00a0(WARNING: Graphic and sexually-explicit content) In a police video released on Monday, Sapp, cries, cackles and confesses during his prostitution arrest . Britney Osbourne, 23 (left), and\u00a0Quying Boyd, 34 (right), were both arrested in Phoenix along with Sapp . The incident allegedly took place very early on February 2 at the Renaissance Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona . He told police one of them began performing oral sex on him - they stayed safe and used a condom - but the other annoyed him by chatting. When it became too much, Sapp told her: 'Why don't you use your mouth on me, instead of using it. 'Just go. Just move. Your girl\u2019s doing a good job. I\u2019ll be done with her in a minute.\u2019 After Sapp asked to have sex, the woman who was performing oral sex asked for a tip. That request apparently prompted an argument and the first video of the interview ended. In surveillance video that was taken in the hotel lobby, Sapp (left) can be seen walking and talking with a man . In the second clip, Sapp is informed he will be going to jail and then left alone in the room. He began repeating, 'Oh my God. Oh my God' before asking: 'Are you kidding me?' In between cackles and sobs, Sapp added: 'I'm going to be booked as a John. 'I gotta go to jail?' Police became involved after a female contacted them and said she had been assaulted. Both women had minor injuries that were consistent with a struggle, but Sapp denied he assaulted them. Sapp was fired from his job at the NFL network and could get six months in jail and three years probation if he is convicted. He was charged with soliciting prostitution and two counts of assault. Sapp\u00a0was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. He is 42 . Osbourne is facing a prostitution charge of her own while Boyd was cited for failure to register with the state as an escort. They have both denied the charges. Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. In recent years, Sapp, a divorced father of two, has been struggling with financial problems, which culminated in 2012 when he filed for bankruptcy. In November of that year, the Super Bowl champion was forced to sell his  home in Florida for $2.1million. Months earlier, Sapp auctioned off a 240-pair collection of rare Air Jordan sneakers worth $6,500 to pay his creditors. Sapp has yet to comment on the video.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nManchester United have been brilliant in the second half of the season but the defeat at Everton was a timely reminder that they still have a long way to go. United played like Sunderland on a bad day \u2013 they were that horrendous. Recently I wrote about what United need to take them back to a proper challenge for domestic and European glory. Now it's time to name names. Teams will have bad days, of course. It's no surprise to those of us who can see his quality and importance to United, but without Michael Carrick they look far more beatable. I can't see how Everton score that first goal if Carrick is on the pitch. Louis van Gaal needs some big signings in the summer to turn Manchester United into title contenders . Borussia Dortmund's midfield pair of Ilkay Gundogan (left) and Sven Bender (right) fit the bill . Daley Blind is a poverty-stricken pauper's version of Carrick in that position. The Dutchman is a slower version of the Geordie, which is quite an achievement, and so more reinforcements are needed. That's why it would be a good idea for United to raid Borussia Dortmund. Ilkay Gundogan has already been linked with a move to Old Trafford \u2013 it's a no-brainer. This player is physical yet graceful. He can spot a pass and execute it first time. He's dynamic and never hides. Alongside him in that Dortmund midfield is Sven Bender - the German Carrick. These players make relatively few tackles because they anticipate and intercept \u2013 they read the game. Daley Blind struggled to cope in Manchester United's midfield during their 3-0 defeat by Everton . David de Gea, Blind and Ashley Young react after conceding a goal in a big defeat by Everton on Sunday . But when Bender tackles, the opponent knows about it \u2013 he is a beast. Despite his frame (he's 6ft 1in, slightly shorter than Carrick), he is quick to step into a tackle. Opponents think they have a bit of time on the ball but Bender makes up the ground in a flash to rob them. What I'm saying here is that United may need two players to replace Carrick. And those two fit the bill. Both are winners, both have had years in Dortmund playing some magnificent football. And if Louis van Gaal is raiding Dortmund he might as well sign Armenia's finest Henrikh Mkhitaryan. What a playmaker this guy is \u2013 he floats around picking the ball up wherever he can, gets the team into advanced positions and can spot a pass. He can score goals too. Manchester United look far more vulnerable without Michael Carrick in their midfield . Armenian creative threat Henrikh Mkhitaryan has been linked with a move to the Premier League before . Gundogan, like Bender, could be leaving Dortmund this summer along with departing manager Jurgen Klopp . I think he's a more positive version of Juan Mata \u2013 look how often the Spaniard gave the ball away at Goodison on Sunday. There's a lot to admire about Mata's game, but he is one of the guilty ones when you look at the reasons for United being ponderous in their build-up. United also need a centre half and another striker \u2013 it's a work in progress after the post-Fergie collapse. But the Dortmund trio would bring instant reward for Van Gaal. And it's not just plucking names out of nowhere: the timing is right for them to move on just as manager Jurgen Klopp leaves. There is a way any Manchester United team must play \u2013 David Moyes found that out to his cost, and earlier this season Van Gaal listened to the fans' loud and clear disapproval of negative football and passes going backwards too often and changed the way they played. Hoofing it up to Marouane Fellaini has happened \u2013 not as often as the critics make out \u2013 but with certain players out, Van Gaal has felt that tactic is the best way to get results. Van Gaal knows anything less than a top-four finish is failure. Juan Mata was wasteful in possession against Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday . Mkhitaryan (right) challenges Eintracht Frankfurt's Carlos Zambrano during a Bundesliga game . Marouane Fellaini's rebirth has been a big factor in Manchester United's excellent form over the past weeks . So much has been made of Dortmund's poor season, but even during that time they managed to finish top of their Champions League group above Arsenal. And the second half of the campaign has seen a revival that has led them to the top half when before Christmas relegation looked a possibility. These are not bad players just because of half a season. These are players who, if they successfully bring their A game with them from Germany, could improve United's starting XI massively. If United are going to raid a club for good players, there are some rich pickings at Dortmund.\u00a0And I haven't even mentioned Mats Hummels.",

The spectacular isolated fort, one of three guarding the entrance to the Solent, just off the coast of the Isle of Wight, has been turned into a luxury impregnable haven complete with a rooftop hot tub, shops and even its own nightclub, thanks to a multi-million pound revamp. The unique hotel looks like could be a fortress of a James Bond villain and can sleep 44 guests with a capacity of 200 for parties and events. Scroll down for video . For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck for ocean views . The No Man's Fort has been transformed by AmaZing Venues to become a luxury hotel, and is set to open on April 23 . With four floors packed with a variety of entertaining facilities, it\u2019s a unique location that\u2019s sure to leave guests with unforgettable memories . The sea fort is located 2km out at sea, meaning guests have to make an exciting entrance by helicopter or by boat. On arrival at the ocean hotspot, guests can hit up the shops, restaurants, luxury spa, rooftop bar and firepit, cabaret bar, nightclub or LaZer Battle Arena. If water sports are more your style this is the perfect base for enjoying\u00a0RIB rides, jet biking, sea kayaking, or kite surfing. A spokesman for AmaZing Venues said: 'No Man's Fort is an inspiring private island that offers an unrivalled experience. 'It is three times the size of Spitbank Fort and boasts its own lighthouse with spectacular views across the Solent. 'You'd think being a mile offshore is unique enough, but we've crammed every possible space with unusual things to see and experience. Built between 1867 and 1880, No Man's Fort was one of several forts ordered by then-Prime Minister Lord Palmerston to fend off the French Navy. It needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. At the time it cost \u00a3462,500 to build, which with inflation would be equivalent to more than \u00a343million today. It was the first fort in England, and possibly Europe, to use hydraulic power to move the guns in horizontal and vertical planes for targeting and the first to be lighted throughout with electricity. The fort was in active use by the military up to 1957 - housing anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War - and became a scheduled ancient monument in 1967. A developer bought it in 1987 to convert it into a luxury residence but failed to find a millionaire buyer. Birmingham businessman Harmesh Pooni bought it to run as as a corporate hospitality venue but he ran into financial difficulties and had to close down. He eventually barricaded himself inside until he was removed. The fort eventually sold in 2009 for just \u00a3910,000. 'The potential of this magnificent sea fortress is only restrained by your imagination. 'A trip to the fort can be as relaxing or action-packed as you wish. 'For those intent on relaxation, No Man's offers its own spa, a choice of bars and a large sun deck.' Described on the website as '75,000 sq ft of fun,' adventurers can unwind overlooking the spectacular rooftop views, whilst enjoying a BBQ, before retiring to one of the 23 luxury suites which cost \u00a3450 per night. Those who have the means to splash out on the best suite in the fort, the plush lighthouse facilities can cost \u00a31,150 a night during the summer. Bond villain haven! The modern fort has two helipad zones, as well as offering roof top BBQ facilities for an ocean-facing meal . Do not disturb! The fort boasts 23 luxury suites and can sleep 44 guests, with prices ranging from \u00a3450 per night . A room with a view! Not only does this hotel offer one of the most private hotel stays, but also incredible ocean views . The unusual destination boasts a colourful history and was even featured in the 1971 Dr Who episode, The Sea Devils, with Jon Pertwee. Built between 1867 and 1880, it was originally used to defend the coast against French invasion, and was used during both world wars to protect Portsmouth Harbour from attacks. In order to construct the impressive fort, huge blocks of granite were transported by barge to the site, and were lowered onto the seabed for its foundations. Luxury loo! The hotel has been renovated with many modern activities and facilities for guests to have a comfortable and memorable stay . Views above the atrium roof are spectacular, and guests can enjoy a meal on the roof overlooking the beautiful coast off the Isle of Wight . The thick 60ft-high concrete walls mean guests can rest easy knowing the fort can withstand any ocean waves crashing again its sides. While it would have cost about \u00a3462,500 to build when it was first created, inflation would equate to that figure being closer to \u00a343million today. AmaZing Venues forked out \u00a33million in first transforming sister venue, Spitbank Fort, which opened in 2012, with this venture being three times as big. The glass atrium of the sea fort allows light to stream into the remote hotel.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nWashington (CNN)It's the mistake that Hillary Clinton won't make again: ignoring her gender. The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University.  \"People are ready for a woman president.  The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\" According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again . In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough. She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on. The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history. But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics. \"She is the gender card.  She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it. She is the woman candidate. She has shared women's experiences. Being a mom and a grandmother,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.  \"She will just naturally bring it in. If she overplayed it, which she won't, it could backfire.\" Republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the Obama years.  The Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's president, put it this way at the group's recent annual meeting: \"Eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\" Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didn't think it would be Clinton. \"There's a couple of things there. Trust, honesty -- those get in her way,\" Blackburn said. \"As we talk about the polling that is out there, that gets in Hillary's way and she's not authentic.\" In 2014, Democratic candidates such as former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits. Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues. And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans. Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\" \"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. \"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign.  You aren't going to win 100% of women.\" Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men. Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness. \"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said. And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell. But Clinton will have some high-profile champions. Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. \"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I'm ready for Hillary. And America is ready for Hillary. She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\" At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\" In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes. But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.",

But that was just the start for Hillary Clinton's most trusted aide Huma Abedin. And so, relishing her final taste of freedom before the presidential campaign kicks off, the notoriously low-profile staffer enjoyed a family day out in New York - with another Mexican bite. The 38-year-old was spotted with her husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, and two-year-old son Jordan tucking into her second spicy menu of the week on Saturday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Before the campaign heats up: Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin (left) was spotted grabbing a Mexican lunch with husband Anthony Weiner and three-year-old son Jordan at quaint Tortaria in New York on Saturday . Low profile: Weiner (second left) and Adebin wore baseball caps as they enjoyed their lunch with their son. Weiner had swung his cap backwards for the dining portion . Skipping Chipotle: Their restaurant of choice was two doors down from the popular fast food Mexican diner . Abedin and Clinton were seen ordering a burrito bowl and a salad in an Iowa Chipotle this week but came under fire after staff complained Abedin did not put any change in the tip jar. Chipotle does not always have tip jars . The family was pictured inside at a table, where Weiner swung his New York Mets baseball cap backwards while he ate. It is just a few days after Abedin and Clinton were spotted, sunglasses on, in an Iowa branch of fast food favorite Chipotle. Grabbing a burrito bowl and a salad, the pair dashed back out to the 'Scooby Van' - and failed to pay a tip. This time, with her boss out of sight, Abedin side-stepped Chipotle and opted instead for a more upmarket eatery next door: Tortar\u00eda. Weiner and Abedin both wore baseball caps in the restaurant off Union Square, where tortas range from $7.50 to $11. As well as food served at the table, customers can also buyMexican fare to use at home. Weiner, a former congressman, fell from grace after sending explicit images to women over Twitter. He ordered the family's food as his wife sat with headphones in listening to a conference call. Abedin's husband Weiner is the disgraced former congressman who was caught sending explicit images to women over Twitter's private message system. The couple stayed together throughout the saga in 2011 . The family will no doubt have to ride out more storms with fierce Republican campaigns against Hillary . Classy: The restaurant also doubles as a bodega, selling Mexican-inspired pantry staples . Keen to get going: Abedin looks back as Weiener brings up the rear, holding his son's scooter and helmet in one hand . It was a quiet and relaxed day for the family as they embark on a doubtless hectic journey toward the 2016 election. Rand Paul quipped on Saturday that the Clinton campaign will require two planes wherever they go - 'one for her entourage, and one for her baggage'. 'I'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering,' Paul said. Opinions were divided over whether the former Secretary of State nailed her attempt to woo Middle America with her tour of Iowa. Not the only one with a taste for Mexican: Marco Rubio also dipped into Chipotle for lunch the other day . In a bid to win over the everyman, she met with voters and laid out her vision for a campaign to be a champion for the average American. And, of course, visited Chipotle. Clinton is not the only presidential hopeful who has been seen tucking into Mexican fast food on the trail as they each try to court Hispanic and low-income voters. Republican hopeful Marco Rubio has also grabbed a Chipotle lunch. Jeb Bush, however, admits that is not on his to-do list - as he and his Colombian wife cook 'authentic' Mexican food at home.",

Chinese designers have developed an contraption called the Bike Washing Machine that contains a washing machine drum in its front wheel. When ridden, the pedalling motion causes the drum to rotate, churning your clothes inside like a traditional washer. Chinese designers have developed a washing machine so cyclists can clean clothes while exercising (above) A generator inside the bike also creates electricity which can be stored for future use. The designers,  based at Dalian Nationalities University, do not say whether the bike will automatically fill and drain with water too. Instead, the detergent and water may need to be added and then drained before more water being added for a rinse cycle. They say, however, that the device could be a solution for those who want both a washing machine and an exercise bike but cannot find space for both. Alternatively it could also help shave a few pounds off your electricity bill by using pedal power to do the laundry. By changing the front wheel of the exercise bike into a washing machine drum it will spin as the user pedals . A generator attached to the pedals (shown above) also produces electricity which can be stored for later use . The invention could also find use in remote areas where people do not have access to reliable supplies of electricity. Students at the university are now building a prototype of the machine. The group submitted the design onto the website Tuvie,which allows designers to share their ideas. They said: 'Riding a bike is a popular exercise, washing laundry is something that you might do on daily basis or at least once a week, unless you keep buying new clothes and underwear, so why not combine them into a single useful equipment/appliance? The designers say the device is perfect for those struggling to find space for both a washing machine and an exercise bike . 'Bike Washing Machine combines a stationary bicycle and washing machine, you can exercise while at the same time simultaneously washing your clothes. 'When you ride this bike, the pedalling motion causes the drum of the washing machine to rotate, at the same time, the superfluous electricity is generated which can be used to power the display screen or stored for future use.' It is not the first time cycling and the weekly wash have been combined. In 2011 Richard Hewitt, a design student at Sheffield Hallam University, announced he had developed a similar device that washes and dries clothes using pedal power. His Spincycle machine could be attached to the back of a tricycle. Riding the bike for 10 minutes would wash the clothes before the water needed to be drained and refilled before another 10 minute cycle rinsed the clothes. If cycling and doing your washing at the same time does not appeal, then perhaps another device that combines a treadmill with a washing machine. Looking more like a giant hamster wheel, it features a series of wash tubs enclosed within a large rotating wheel. The Wheel washing machine, dreamed up by South Korean designer Si Hyeong Ryu, would also generate electricity that could be used to power other household appliances. Ryu created the concept\u00a0for the 2014 Electrolux Design Lab competition. The Wheel concept features washing balls inside the canisters, designed to save water and improve washing .",

The football purists are foaming at the mouth \u2013 how can this Portuguese pretender dare to win games without wanting the football? Is this the most negative side to ever win the title? Is this the most terrible team to lift the Champions\u2019 crown? Woah there, just hang on a moment. Jose Mourinho has come under fire for Chelsea's lack of possession during their 1-0 win over Man United . Mourinho and his staff and players celebrate the crucial win over United on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . I\u2019m no fan of the kind of football Chelsea played on Saturday to beat Manchester United. But at the end of the season, they are getting the job done, it\u2019s as simple as that. And who can blame Mourinho for being so cautious? Last season they were seven points clear at the top of the table but fell away after losing at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace \u2013 both in the bottom half of the table at the time, and were beaten at home by Sunderland, who were six points adrift in 20th place. And then needing a win to go top of the Premier League with just two games to go, Mourinho watched his side draw 0-0 at home to Norwich, who were about to be relegated. The title that had been in their grasp, was lost. Chelsea\u2019s most impressive result during that run-in was a 2-0 win at Liverpool, a game made famous by Steven Gerrard\u2019s slip. It ended Liverpool\u2019s 16-match unbeaten run and checked their charge to the title. That day Chelsea let Liverpool have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes. Chelsea found a way to win without the ball. And Mourinho did the same on Saturday to an in-form Manchester United, who had 70 per cent possession at Stamford Bridge. It\u2019s not my kind of football \u2013 I like to see what talented professional players can do with the ball. And so does Louis van Gaal. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Steven Gerrard slips against Chelsea at Anfield last season - a game Chelsea won with only 17% possession . Ba scores as Chelsea go on to win at Anfield and effectively end Liverpool's title push last season . The Dutch master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit. All clubs have injuries, but for that massive game on Saturday, United needed key players in the team. It would have been fascinating to see if Van Gaal\u2019s possession philosophy would have won the day, over the Jose way. Chelsea won the game, and they did it in typical Mourinho fashion \u2013 by not wanting possession of the football. Jose has learned a lot from his mistakes of last season. I understand his pragmatism given that Chelsea are so close to sealing the title. But he fell into this negativity way too early in the season, and it led to their abject failure in Europe. Mourinho needs to be more expansive in the Champions League next season \u2013 that\u2019s for sure. Andre Schurrle\u2019s goal against Burnley after a sublime pass from Cesc Fabregas was a highlight of the season . But don\u2019t judge this Chelsea side on the Premier League run-in alone: they may not have been consistently sparkling with their style, but they have had some wonderful moments this season. On day one of the season Cesc Fabregas\u2019 sublime disguised pass for Andre Schurrle\u2019s goal at Burnley had us all out of our seats. It wasn\u2019t his only example of genius since August. When fit, Diego Costa\u2019s strength, movement and finishing have been a joy to watch. And then there\u2019s Eden Hazard. The player Mesut Ozil, Angel di Maria, Samir Nasri and Raheem Sterling and others all dream of being. Yes some of those others have medals, but they haven\u2019t shown the same amazing ability as the Chelsea number 10. His balance, his control, his passing and finishing have all been superb all season. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Manchester Untied's Wayne Rooney (right) Oscar (second left) scores against Swansea as Chelsea run riot at the Liberty Stadium in January . And during this period when Jose Mourinho is being over-cautious, making sure they secure the title they let slip last season, Hazard has lifted the team from a blue sea of negative mediocrity, to one capable of star quality. And back in January, Chelsea gave arguably the best footballing display of the season in the Premier League when they went to Swansea and won 5-0. The one-touch football was special, and the way the three behind Costa drifted around was reminiscent of the total football played by sides born out of Rinus Michels\u2019 Ajax and Holland sides of the 1970s. Chelsea were 4-0 in front at the break, by which time Willian had also hit the bar twice. Jose\u2019s side completely outplayed and outpassed one of the better footballing sides in the division. So don\u2019t be too harsh on Chelsea, on their way to the title it\u2019s hell to watch them right now. But Mourinho\u2019s men have taken us to heaven enough times this season to keep the critics off their backs.",

Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club\u2019s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury . Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season . Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked \u2018absolutely sensational\u2019 after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. One thing Liverpool\u2019s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas . Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year\u2019s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. \u2018It\u2019s a long time out,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018When you\u2019re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. \u2018The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he\u2019ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.\u2019 Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday . Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off . Rodgers added: \u2018Every player is different. With Daniel there\u2019s been a number of injuries that he\u2019s had and that\u2019s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. \u2018He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn\u2019t all down to you \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s about luck as well.\u2019",

Now, the tiny settlement of Tristan da Cunha is seeking the help of architects and designers the world over to secure its future well into the 21st century. With the help of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the UK overseas territory is holding an international competition to improve aging infrastructure and make the island self-sustainable as it approaches the 200th anniversary of its settlement. As a sign of just how removed Tristan da Cunha is from the rest of the world, there are only seven family names on the islands. Those who live there are mainly the descendants of Dutch, American and Italian sailors as well as 19th century British explorers. There are also a handful of expatriate Brits. But watching hit TV series \"Lost\"or reading up on William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\" won't be required research for competition entrants. Instead, those with experience of renewable energy in remote regions, modern housing and developing cost-effective agrarian systems are encouraged to apply. \"The competition is looking at enhancing the built environment on the island (and) making all structures more energy efficient,\" the island's administrator, Alex Mitcham told CNN when visiting the UK recently. Mitcham explained that most existing homes and public buildings on Tristan da Cunha are small, bungalow-type structures made from made from a mix of concrete and local volcanic rock. Few have simple insulation that can lead to energy savings while the infrastructure for things like renewable power generation and internet provision remain limited. The island is also only accessible by sea 60-days-a-year through a small port in its only town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. According to James Porter of RIBA Competitions, contestants will have to factor in irregular design questions such as \"how can we get the material ashore and how can we actually think of ways that we can put things together once there?\" \"There are limitations on the amount of cargo that can be trans-shipped,\" he added. In total, Tristan da Cunha is made up of four islands. Tristan is the largest land mass and the only one to house people. Two more unpopulated islands, Nightingale and Inaccessible, lie close by. A third, Gough, is situated roughly 230 miles away. Both Gough and Inaccessible are UNESCO World Heritage sites. The closest mainland port is Cape Town, South Africa, some seven days sailing time and 1,750 miles north-east. Tristan already has a pub, shop, cafe, dance hall, museum, catholic church and swimming pool. There are also two expatriate doctors, two Tristanian nurses and school teachers with some 30 students of varying ages. The island's main industry is lobster fishing, with exports reaching as far afield as the U.S., Australia, Japan and the EU thanks to a fishing company that has exclusive rights to fish in the surrounding waters. Tristan earns additional income from the sale of unique stamps, coins and handicraft souvenirs, Mitcham explained. Modest revenue also flows from tourism and visitor accommodation. \"As it is the remotest inhabited island in the world, the Tristanians are already very self sufficient, being able to produce many of their own foodstuffs (like fish, livestock and potatoes),\" Mitcham said. However, the cost of living has increased in recent years, he added. With limited transport and communication links, the islanders are also keen to see how they can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, improve the energy efficiency of properties and reduce imports. \"We are slowly updating 40-year old infrastructure,\" Mitcham said of the last time the island experienced a major redesign. That modernization happened roughly a decade after the island was evacuated temporarily due to ongoing volcanic activity. Before that period, the main way for the islanders to communicate with the outside world was by Morse code. Things have already changed a lot since then, however. \"A new water system, electrical system and waste water system have just been completed,\" Mitcham said. \"And with the 200th Anniversary of the founding of Tristan (2016) almost upon us it is an appropriate time to look at new initiatives that may be able to help the future viability of the community.\" Interested architects have until mid-June to submit their initial ideas. The best will be whittled down to an initial 20 and then five after further analysis between June and September. Porter and Mitcham say the islanders will have to apply to the UK and possibly the EU for grants to fund the project. The winner is penciled in to be announced in June 2016. The most important aspect for applicants is to \"identify cost-effective and practical solutions to improve the energy efficiency (through renewable energy sources) of properties,\" Mitcham said \"as well as modernizing ... government structures.\"",

The enormous lump, which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes, was so heavy that it caused the 1940s sewer in Chelsea to break. Utility companies, including Thames Water, discovered the fatberg when local residents and businesses on Draycott Avenue and Walton Street started to complain about the rancid smell coming from the sewer. Scroll down for video . The 10 tonne fatberg, which was discovered beneath one of Chelsea's most exclusive streets after residents complained of a rancid smell . So far the waste removed from the sewer is the equivalent weight of about five Porsche 911s, which weigh 1.9 tonnes each. Now a \u00a3400,000 repair is being carried out to repair the broken sewer and already 22 metres of new piping has been replaced with another 17 metres left to go. Stephen Hunt, project manager for Thames Water said: 'The amount of fat we've had to remove has been staggering. 'Cheslea has done itself proud here - we see blockages all the time on household sewer pipes, which are about big enough for a cricket ball to pass through - but to have this much damage on a sewer almost a metre in diameter is mind-boggling. Thames Water, have now been forced to repair the old brick sewer, left, at a cost of \u00a3400,000 after it became damaged due to the fatberg . 'The original sewer has been so badly abused by fat being chucked down the plughole we've had to opt for the time consuming and disruptive option of replacing many metres of pipe. 'I'd urge the residents of Chelsea to consider what lurks beneath their feet - and when it comes to getting rid of fat - bin it, don't block it. Fatbergs \u2013 congealed fat which clumps together with other waste products to form concrete-style blocks \u2013 are becoming increasingly problematic for the capital's sewers. The enormous lump, which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes, was found beneath Draycott Avenue and Walton Street in West London, pictured . London's largest ever recorded fatberg, weighing in at 15 tonnes, was found in Kingston in August 2013. And last year workers spent four days removing a fatberg the length of a jumbo jet from a sewer in Shepherd's Bush. Among the most common causes of drain blockages are make-up and nappy wipes, fat and grease, chewing gum, dental floss, plasters and building debris. Staff from Thames Water usually use powerful suction equipment to break down the blockages and then high-powered water jets to clear the tunnels.",

Peter Hiett, a decorated former prison guard at Feltham Young Offenders Institution, said staff would put inmates in a cell padded with mattresses and leave them to fight out any differences. The 49-year-old, who worked at the jail for eight years and was commended for bravery, said some workers would even stay and watch the battle unfold, while others 'turned a blind eye to it'. He also said gangs controlled entire wings at the jail in Hounslow, south west\u00a0London, leaving staff afraid to visit some areas of the prison for fear of being attacked. Scroll down for video . Peter Hiett, a decorated former prison guard at Feltham Young Offenders Institution in Hounslow (pictured), claims staff\u00a0regularly arrange brutal fights between rival criminals behind bars at Britain's toughest jail . The claims echo scenes from 1999 film Fight Club starring Brad Pitt, in which gangsters organise mass brawls in underground 'fight clubs'. Mr Hiett told\u00a0The Sunday People: 'It was like a sport for them. If two inmates had a grudge they'd put them together in a room to sort it out. 'They only stopped when one was knocked out or couldn't defend themselves any more.' His revelations come after he left the prison in January last year, amid claims he was forced out for trying to lift the lid on the goings-on. He claims the in-fighting was often kept hidden from the overriding authorities, with the prison's management setting up a Behaviour Management Group to 'fiddle the assault figures'. He said common tactics were to treat group attacks as just one assault and to encourage inmates to admit to the lesser charge of health and safety over assault. The former officer said: 'There would be 15 or 20 lads from the same gang on the same wing. They would protect each other, deal drugs. 'And if they saw another gang member all hell broke loose \u2013 their wars don't stop when they're behind bars. 'But if an inmate assaulted someone, the governor didn't want it written down like that. Staff would advise prisoners to admit a lesser charge.' There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution last year , a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons found (file picture) Claims from former prison officer Peter Hiett about Feltham echo that of scenes in 1999 film Fight Club (above) Earlier this year, it was revealed that inmates at Feltham represent 48 different gangs, fuelling a 'constant juggling' by prison officers to keep the boys apart. A report found there were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at the young offenders' institution, a significant amount of which was gang-related. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said. Former Feltham prison officer Emma Beard pictured outside court ahead of being jailed . Former prison offer Peter Hiett was also among the guards who reported fellow worker Emma Beard for performing sex acts on an inmate in his cell. Beard, a married mother-of-four, had sex with teenage murderer Danny McLean, then aged 18, at Feltham Young Offenders Institution and even wrote love letters to him, which included intimate photographs. Beard, then aged 31, pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office and was jailed for 12 months at Isleworth Crown Court in 2010. Jailing her, Judge Oliver told her: 'You put the security of yourself and the other officers at the young offenders' institution at risk and that is a serious matter. 'It has to be prison for you, you cannot in your role, break the law and expect to get away with it.' The number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous HMIP inspection, but remained 'too high' with 262 incidents between July 2014 and January this year, including 79 assaults on staff. Some incidents were deemed 'very serious' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a 'very determined way'. Feltham is divided into two sites, with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site A, and 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site B. Mr Hiett said he tried to raise his concerns several times internally before he eventually approached Jeremy Wright \u2013 who was the Minister for Prisons at the time. Mr Wright ordered an inspection of the prison in March 2013 and called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run. Inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted. Despite calls for an overhaul, Feltham was named last year as the most violent prison in England and Wales by the Howard League for Penal Reform. But the authorities believe improvements are underway and it is simply taking time to see the changes because of the 'multiple challenges that need to be addressed'. Following the publication of January's report, Lin Hinnigan, the chief executive of the Youth Justice Board, said: 'It is clear from the report that, since the last inspection in 2013, improvements to Feltham A have been made; and we are grateful to the inspection team for recognising the dedication of the staff who work there. 'However, and as the report also acknowledges, the young people placed in Feltham are some of the most challenging of the cohort we have across the youth secure estate. 'Improving Feltham A is very much a work in progress, and will take time because of the multiple challenges that need to be addressed.' In response to Mr Hietts' claims, a spokesman for HM Prison Service told MailOnline: 'These inflammatory and damaging allegations are completely untrue and do a huge disservice to the hard working staff at YOI Feltham. 'It is totally untrue to claim that staff have been complicit in any acts of violence, or that there are \"no-go\" areas within the establishment. 'It is also absolutely wrong to say that figures relating to incidents at Feltham have been in any way altered.'",

Current and former female agents spoke out to the New York Times on Sunday to renounce depictions of CIA women on TV shows and in movies. The group of women say they are nothing like the honey-pots on these shows who use their sexuality to ensnare terrorists and drown PTSD with booze and pills. Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes, 69, who helped expose her colleague Aldrich Ames as a Russian double agent, says she sees nothing of herself in the characters at the center of shows like State of Affairs and Homeland. 'I wish they wouldn\u2019t use centerfold models in tight clothes. We don\u2019t look that way. And we don\u2019t act that way,' Grimes told the Times. Scroll down for video . That's not me: Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes (pictured above in January 2013) \u00a0is one of many former and current women at the agency speaking out about depictions of female spies on TV and in movies . Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett, one of the 'Band of Sisters' who helped track down Osama bin Laden, has the most trouble with how her fallen co-worker Jennifer Matthews was portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty. In the scenes before her death in a terrorist attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, actress Jennifer Ehle plays Matthews as a 'giddy' agent, excitedly baking a Jordanian source a cake for their meeting on his birthday. As in real life, Matthews dies as the agent gets out of his car and detonates a suicide vest. 'The problem is that they portray most women in such a one-dimensional way; whatever the character flaw is, that\u2019s all they are,' Bennett said.\u00a0'It can leave a very distinct understanding of women at the agency - how we function, how we relate to men, how we engage in national security - that is pretty off.' One of the fictional CIA agents currently on screen is Charlie Tucker on NBC's State of Affairs. Played by Katherine Heigl, Charlie is a character who in the first episode gets drunk at a bar, sleeps with a stranger and lashes out at her psychiatrist. Another example is Homeland's Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Danes) - a bi-polar spy who gives up nearly all responsibility for her child (the product of a secret relationship with a double agent) and spends most of her time controlling sources with sex. A retired covert officer identified as Meredith says sex isn't a major part of the spy game. Offensive: Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett says she was upset with the 'giddy' portrayal of her friend Jennifer Matthews (left) in the movie Zero Dark Thirty (played by Jennifer Ehle, right). Matthews, in real life as in the movie, was killed by a suicide bomber at an Afghanistan military base in 2009 . 'Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. For me, working in the Middle East, there\u2019s a lot of attraction for Middle Eastern men for Western women. I don\u2019t mean necessarily sexually...but curiosity, if nothing else. And we certainly have played that.' However, Meredith says she more often has to put men in their place while doing her work. 'You need to remove [sex] off the table very quickly and clearly. Sometimes it\u2019s \"Get your hands off my knee or I\u2019m going to break it,\" or you put as many people into the room as you can,' she said. While the trials and tribulations of female agents on screen are wildly exaggerated, the women interviewed said they do similarly struggle to maintain the balance between their work and private lives. It's not about sex: The real women of the CIA say they are not all honey-pots who use their sexuality to control sources (like Carrie Mathison on Showtime's Homeland, played by Claire Danes above) Sending the wrong message: The women also take issue with NBC show State of Affairs, which features Katherine Heigl (above) as a troubled CIA analyst . 'I briefed Condoleezza Rice while in labor. I\u2019d tell her about the global jihad and then I would turn away and breathe. When these two worlds clash, they clash really hard,' Bennett said. Bennett says that the concerns of her job are so important, that it's hard to come home and sympathize with the minor dramas ruling her teenager's life. 'I deal with people who are trying to kill lots of people in horrendous, painful ways. So I have a wall; it\u2019s really tall. Unfortunately, though, what happens with time is you can\u2019t click it on or off. You just block the sensation of feeling,' Bennett said. 'I\u2019m no longer married because of my wall. So I have five kids whose parents aren\u2019t together because I constructed that wall over time and didn\u2019t know how to get through it,' Bennett added. Many of the women though said they enjoyed working for the agency, which is becoming more and more female friendly with a day care center in Langley and flexible time off. Which is good because Bennett thinks women naturally make great agents. 'Women don\u2019t think more intuitively than men, but we tend to trust our own gut less. We are not going to put all our money in one basket,' she said.",

A Romanian woman who believed she was pregnant was devastated to be told she actually had an 11lb tumour inside her uterus. Madalina Neagu, 42, arrived at a hospital in with severe pain in her abdomen and told doctors she believed she was in labour. As a result, medics at Botosani County Hospital prepared to operate to deliver the child. But after carrying out tests, they were shocked to discover she wasn't pregnant at all. Instead, she was actually carrying a 11lbs (5kg) tumour inside her uterus. One of the doctors treating her, Dr Dorin Scladan, 47, said: 'As the woman told us she was pregnant, we initially expected pregnancy complications. 'In fact, the size of her belly was quite similar to that of a nine-month pregnant woman, so we didn't have any reason to doubt what she told us.' Dr Sclandan and his colleage Dr Camelia Todica, 43, carried out an operation to remove the tumour. The patient was then transferred to intensive care - and doctors say she will recover. Dr Scladan said: 'We don't often see a tumour of this size and in this location.' The news comes after last year MailOnline reported on the story of Lorna Fulton, 44, who desperately wanted a family and believed she was pregnant when her stomach began to swell. She had ballooned to a size 26 and her waistline had been expanding despite months of dieting. But while she hoped this was a sign she was expecting, specialists discovered a huge ovarian cyst. Mrs Fulton was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach. It was revealed she had been carrying around a 5st cyst, a sac of fluid that forms on the ovary, for months. She recovered after the operation, and although she now cannot have children, says she feels 'lucky to be alive'. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to remove the tumour from the woman's uterus, and she was transferred to intensive care . And in 2012, MailOnline reported on the story of Kayleigh Terry, 21, who believed she was pregnant with her first child after gaining weight. But she was terrified to discover she actually had cancer. An ultrasound scan revealed she had a large cancerous growth which covered an area from her breast to her lower abdomen. She was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma and had emergency chemotherapy to shrink the potentially deadly tumour.

Not just for the best view in the house and the chance that your neighbour might be a celebrity or Anna Wintour... but for the goodie bag. Stars, buyers and fashion editors in the 'FROW' are often showered with gift bags stuffed with treats from the show sponsors. The Maticevski show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia on Tuesday went above and beyond to impress guests, with front row attendees given a personalised tablet. But a few of the highly-prized gifts went missing when someone with sticky fingers - perhaps a disgruntled second row guest - decided to snap them up for themselves. Scroll down for video . Sticky fingers: Singer Jessica Mauboy was among the front row attendees at the Maticevski show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia who had her gifted tablet stolen from her seat . We cleaned up! Zac (left) and Jordan Stenmark and Lindy Klim looked thrilled with their customised tablets . All mine: Nadia Bartel also got her hands on a coveted tablet thanks to her front row position . Jessica Mauboy, model Maddison Brow, and GQ editor Nick Smith were among those who had their Lenovo tablets stolen from their seats. It should be easy to spot the culprits though, as each of the tablets had been customised with wallpaper bearing their name. Celebrities including Lindy Klim, and Jordan and Zac Stenmark were pictured fawning over their personalised Lenovo tablets before the show started. Not a bad goodie bag: Each front row guest was given an $899 Lenovo tablet with their gift bag at the show . Perks of the job: Fashion editors including Elle editor Justine Cullen were among the lucky recipients, and were quick to share their haul on social media . Show organisers had a few back-ups of the $899 tablet on hand that were not customised to give to the theft victims. Despite the drama, the show was a spectacular success, with an A-list turn-out and dazzling creations gracing the catwalk. Toni Maticevski, whose designs are beloved by Jennifer Hawkins, Abbie Cornish and Jess Hart, presented a glimmering display complete with gold, glitter, mesh and tulle. High tech: Models on the catwalk also carried the tablets, which displayed a live stream of the show . Neckless: Models were seen to be keeping necks hidden in Maticevski's neutral couture  dress line . Soft summer: Models wear a pastel palette with soft, summery tulles, transparent fabrics and flowing designs . Maticevski, who began his career with bridal gowns, stuck to his signature wrap look but branched out this season with new metallic and pastel palettes and a mix of bold and conservative cuts. The star of the couture collection though was the glittery, gold metallic\u00a0asymmetrical\u00a0dress that not only brightened up the dull  warehouse backdrop but wowed the audience with it's high cut, off the shoulder metallic design. Also featured alongside the  asymmetrical number was a opalescent mesh two piece top and skirt with a gold, triangular panel starring centre front. Maticevski's got the Midas Touch: \u00a0A gold, glittery asymmetrical dress steals the show at Toni Maticevski . The right mesh: A pearlescent mesh two piece also featured in the gold range as shown at Toni Maticevski . Showcasing also in the metallic range was glimmering opaque black maxi skirts, coats and pants. The designs all featured stiff black fabric and wrap designs, with skirts featuring tulle underlays and models wearing transparent black bows in their hair. In addition to the metallic line, Maticevski also created a playful, light, pastel collection for Spring/Summer that features transparent white and lilac overlays, apricot tulle and pretty pink prints. Models in the pastel collection replaced bows with flowers but keeping to their slick buns as seen throughout. 50 shades of grey: Maticevski's classic couture range had models wearing long, \u00a0grey coats and dresses . Black tie: Models match with bold black outfits, heels, bows and furrowed brows . The last range in the collection featured classic, neutral couture pieces with signature folds, asymmetrical lines and frills in abundance. The main colours of the monochrome collection were gunmetal, white and  black and models were seen carrying  transparent domes with flowers inside or wearing clear ball-shaped necklaces to tie in with the pastel, summery collection. Shapes also varied in the final line, with a mix of conservative long trench coats and ankle-length dresses and high-cut, daring just above knee styles.",

Eric Carter and Stephanie McCassin, both of Manchester, were arrested on warrants Thursday, four months after the child's grandmother and primary caretaker, Mary MacDonald, reported finding the child in the tub, with the parents passed out on Dec. 4. Overdose: Eric Carter, 21 (right), and Stephanie McCassin, 24 (left), of New Hampshire, have been charged with endangering the welfare of a child after allegedly overdosing on heroin while giving their 3-year-old son a bath . Passed Out: The child's grandmother told authorities that she went to check on the parents (photographed) and the child in the bathroom and found the two passed out on the bathroom floor while the child remained in the tub . The child was not hurt. MacDonald told Fox Boston\u00a0that she saw the parents in the bathroom with the boy but grew suspicious when the three became quiet in the room. She went to check on them, she said, and found the parents passed out on the bathroom floor as the child remained in the tub, seeming oblivious to the situation. MacDonald contacted authorities and removed the 3-year-old from the tub, according to the Boston Globe. Caretaker: The child's grandmother told authorities that she lives with her son, Carter (left), and is the primary caretaker of the three-year-old because of Carter's history with drugs . Twenty-one-year-old Carter and 24-year-old McCassin were taken to a hospital, where they were treated for an apparent heroin overdose. MacDonald told police that she is the child's primary caretaker because of her son's, Carter's, past drug problems. It was the Department of Child and Family Services that issued the warrant for for the two holding that the parents put the child at risk, Manchester police said in a statement. Treated: Twenty-one-year-old Carter and 24-year-old McCassin (photographed) were taken to a hospital, where they were treated for an apparent heroin overdose . Both have been released on personal recognizance bail. McCassin is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday. Carter is scheduled to appear May 22. A message left at a phone number for McCassin was not immediately returned. No phone listing for Carter could be found.",

The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside\u00a0Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate\u00a0as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.",

Gulam Chowdhury, 24, quoted verses from the Quran before stabbing Mohammed Yasser Afzal 20 times in the east London mini cab office where his victim worked. The court heard that Nargis Riaz, 22, was terrified that Mr Afzal would show intimate photographs to her father who was a strict Imam. Gulam Chowdhury, left, stabbed his love rival Mohammed Afzal, right, 20 times at an east London cab office . The Old Bailey heard that Mr Afzal had threatened to show intimate pictures of Nargis Riaz, to her Imam father . The Old Bailey heard that Ms Riaz had been involved in a relationship with Chowdhury and Mr Riaz for several weeks before the murder on March 24, 2014. Her parents were unaware she was friendly with either man. Chowdhury told Ms Riaz, a second year law student at City University, the attack was justified in Islam claiming: 'Cut the neck of the man who eyed up his wife.' Later he reassured her: 'Don't worry little angel, it's me who's a psycho not you.' Chowdhury showed no emotion today as a jury of seven men and five women found him guilty of the murder of Mr Afzal, 22, on March 24 last year. Riaz, who was also standing trial for murder, faces a retrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict after 21 hours and 37 minutes\u2019 deliberation. Co-defendant Muhammed Khan, 23, was acquitted of assisting an offender. The court heard Ms Riaz had been dating both Chowdhury and Mr Afzal in the weeks before the murder, but kept both relationships from her strict parents. Dramatic CCTV footage showed masked Chowdhury storm the E20 minicab company in Stratford Broadway, east London on March 24 last year. Muhammad Khan, pictured, was acquitted of assisting an offender at the Old Bailey . He vaulted the counter armed with a carving knife as Riaz was stood outside during the frenzied attack. Detectives investigating the murder found a series of texts from Chowdhury to her in the weeks leading up to the attack. In one message, Chowdhury repeatedly asked Riaz if she wanted his rival dead and told her: \u2018No one hurts Nargis and lives\u2019. Having converted to a strict form of Islam while held in an immigration detention centre, Chowdhury regularly quoted the Quran in his messages to Riaz. He told her: \u2018I\u2019m going to sort this out and sort it proper, I will use the flame from my ancestors to burn the world of this scum.\u2019 He also wrote in another message that his ancestors were \u2018fearless lions that would kill for honour\u2019. Chowdhury claimed killing was justified by Islam and included a passage from the Quran which said: \u2018Cut the neck of the man who eyed up his wife\u2019. In another text he wrote: \u2018I need to kill someone\u2019. Prosecutor Sandip Patel QC said Riaz was treated \u2018like a Queen\u2019 by Mr Afzal, but had threatened to show intimate pictures to her parents during a \u2018difficult phase\u2019 in their relationship. \u2018They had known each other before and had been boyfriend and girlfriend in the past but Mr Afzal was unaware Miss Riaz was at that time seeing Mr Chowdhury,\u2019 he said. Riaz, who also worked at Primark in Hackney, claimed she did not believe Chowdhury would carry out his threats. Chowdhury, from Barking, denied, but was convicted of murder. He was held at Broadmoor secure hospital prior to the trial, and was initially deemed unfit to plead due to mental health problems. Riaz, also from Barking, denied murder. Khan, from Dagenham, Essex, denied assisting an offender between March 24 and March 26, 2014 and was acquitted. Speaking outside the court, Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve of the Homicide and Major Command said: 'Gulam Chowdhury carried out a ferocious assault on Mohammed Afzal. The level of violence used was shocking and ensured that Mohammed would not survive the attack. 'Whatever Mohammed's motives were for the actions he took in attempting to maintain his relationship with a woman, he did not deserve to be murdered. 'It is thanks to the thorough and meticulous work of my officers who have worked tirelessly since Mohammed's murder that we have managed to prove Chowdhury planned, and then executed, this vicious assault which ended in the savage murder of a young man.' Eyewitnesses described how Chowdhury was wearing a distinctive 'JD Sports' shoulder bag shortly before the murder. Officers then were able to place him at the scene using CCTV footage and mobile phone cell data analysis. Chowdhury is due to be sentenced on May 1.

Or of course, you may know her as Sean Penn's ex-wife. They met in 1989 just year after he split with Madonna, had their first child two years later, and spent the best part of two decades in perceived marital bliss. But by personal choice, Robin's acting career is one that dwindled rapidly after her Golden Globe nominated performance in the film which cemented the mega-star career of her co-star Hanks.

Last night the Golden Globes kicked off the seemingly never ending round of red carpet events that will keep us entertained for the next two months. And one our favourite actresses stayed on theme for the night in a golden dress. Robin Wright, who won the Best Actress award for her role in House of Cards, wore a slinky dress from Reem Acra's Fall 2013 collection and looked stunning in it. The halter neck showed off her toned shoulders while the sparkly sheen worked beautifully against her skin tone and blonde crop. Reem Acra is a red carpet favourite and often chosen by the A-list for their big nights. Olivia Wilde, Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Zooey Deschanel all love her feminine designs that effortlessly mix colour and a striking silhouette.

It's a well documented case, Robin's eschewing of fame to raise to her children instead. But does she have any regrets? Now that she's had another taste of on-screen success thanks to her role as power-hungry First Lady\u00a0Claire Underwood, does she wish she hadn't given it all up so easily twenty years ago? Nope, not at all, the actress has revealed in an interview with Giles Hattersley for the The Sunday Times Style magazine. Talking about choosing between fame and family, when big movie offers were reportedly pouring in off the back of Forest Gump's success, Robin has said that it was an easy decision to make. 'I don't look back and think, 'F***, I missed putting my kids to bed for four straight years because I was in the theatre.' Playing First Lady\u00a0Claire Underwood in hit American TV series House of Cards, Robin has found acting success for the second time, already winning a Golden Globe for Best TV Actress . Sean Penn and Charlize Theron made their relationship public last summer, and are now rumoured to be engaged. It'll be Penn's third marriage, following his divorces from Madonna in 1989 and Robin Wright in 2010 . Making reference to her famous decline of a big interview with Vanity Fair, along with starring roles in Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves alongside Kevin Costner, and Batman Forever with Val Kilmer, Robin says she was never even interested. 'I didn't want to work four movies in a year and be on every magazine cover. Six months away? Bullshit. Don't have kids!' The actress, who did make an arguably notable appearance in another of Costner's movies, Message In A Bottle, instead says the time she spent at home with her two children, daughter Dylan, now 24, and son Hopper, now 21, was a gift in itself. Robin Wright and Sean Penn's daughter Dylan is an aspiring actress and fashion model, enjoying her first taste of success with a recent campaign for Italian fashion designer\u00a0Ermanno Scervino . 1994 tear-jerker Forest Gump earned Robin a Golden Globe nomination and a fistful of major movie role offers, but she turned her back on a high profile Hollywood career after discovering she was pregnant . Now that her full-time mothering is done and the kids have flown the nest however, it appears Robin is back with a power dressing bang. Her role as Kevin Spacey's on-screen wife has already won her a Golden Globe for Best TV Actress, and her House Of Cards wardrobe has inspired millions of women around the globe.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Robert Bates, 73, shot and killed a man while playing cops and robbers with real police. Bates was a reserve deputy sheriff, which allowed him to \"work full time jobs in the community and volunteer ... time in a myriad of events such as the Special Olympics and Tulsa State Fair,\" according to the Tulsa County Sheriff Office's website. But Bates wasn't limited to crowd control at sporting events for the disabled. He had taken part in more than 100 operations with the violent crimes task force, according to his lawyer.  On April 2, Bates thought he was going to use a Taser on Eric Harris, who deputies had just tackled after he sold an undercover officer a Lugar pistol and then took off running. But Bates wasn't holding a Taser. He was holding his gun. He fired one shot and killed Harris. From a policing perspective, there wasn't even good reason to use a Taser against Harris. Cops were on scene. Harris wasn't getting the upper hand. He wasn't going anywhere. And despite what Bates would later claim, Harris was not running like a man with a gun. In fact, Harris was running fast and his arms were pumping very much like a man who is not protecting a gun in his waistband. What was Bates, an insurance company CEO, doing there in the first place? It certainly looks like Bates was given special access to \"real\" policing. Harris had given $2,500 to Sheriff Stanley Glanz's re-election campaign. He donated cars to the department. He gave equipment. So it would be noteworthy if Bates ends up being convicted based on evidence provided by \"sunglass cameras\" that he may have purchased for the department. A Tulsa police official said the agency has 130 reserve deputies, many of them wealthy people who make donations to the police. \"That's not unusual at all,\" he told the Tulsa World. Maybe Bates could have been a reserve deputy without donating anything. But I doubt there are many volunteer septuagenarians working with the violent crimes task force. He was too old to be policing the streets. Tulsa police said that Bates had served a year in 1964 as a police officer. Most police departments have mandatory retirement ages. Federal law-enforcement officers, for instance, retire at 57. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? Police officers generally look with a skeptical eye toward volunteers. For one thing, it makes it tougher to push for a pay raise when people are offering to do your job for free. But departments also know that you get what you pay for. What is the point of background checks, psychological tests and the professional training police undergo if a person can donate a few grand and go out on patrol? Some people are a little too eager to be police officers. These people perhaps buy a police-like car for their personal car. Maybe they put in a police light or two. Some have actually made car stops. Police departments hate cop impersonators (it's illegal, by the way) and try and weed them during the hiring process. You want workers who like the job, but not too much; there's a fine line between passion and fanaticism. That said, there are good volunteer police officers. New York City, for example, has auxiliary police. These officers received more limited training and they help with neighborhood events and other nonenforcement activities. They wear an NYPD uniform but do not carry a gun. Auxiliary police and similar programs reinforce the notion that the police are the public and the public are the police. Volunteers remind us all that policing is a noble public calling, and most police work does not have to be done by overly militarized SWAT officers. An auxiliary program also allows young recruits a way to dip their foot into the police world before taking the plunge. It can be a great benefit to everybody when potential officers discover the job isn't for them before they are locked into a 20-year commitment. What happened in Tulsa County is a disgrace to police professionalism, and the fallout from this disaster may push police departments to end these kinds of programs. That would be a mistake. Police departments should encourage more productive interactions between police and the public. But a line does need to be drawn.",

United will be looking to end a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats on Sunday when City make the short trip across town. Van Gaal lost his first encounter with United's closest rivals last November, when Sergio Aguero struck the only goal in a 1-0 win for the Blues. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing Man City . Van Gaal, pictured with Juan Mata on Friday, believes Man City will not be as defensive-minded as Aston Villa . Manchester United are currently one point ahead of local rivals Manchester City . But Van Gaal is confident of victory this weekend, stating that he thinks City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favour. Van Gaal believes teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat. Van Gaal is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about Sunday's opposition than he did last week when relegation-threatened Villa came to Old Trafford. 'I had more fear of Aston Villa than Manchester City,' the United manager said, before adding: 'Aston Villa was more defensive. 'I don't expect Manchester City shall play so defensive as Aston Villa. Then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence. 'A long ball is very difficult to defend. But (against) Manchester City, I don't expect very much long balls. 'It's another game and that's why I have less fear against Manchester City in spite of losing 1-0 against them in the last game.' Ander Herrera scored two goals as Manchester United picked up all three points against Aston Villa . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the match during this season's previous Manchester derby . That is not to say he would not cherish his first win over City. 'I dream of it, every player shall dream of the victory,' the United boss said. During his nine months in charge, assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club chef Mike Donnelly have taught the Dutchman about United's rivalries. But if he needed a reminder of the enmity between City and United, he got it this week from his wife Truus, whose hairdresser is a blue. 'I'm not so often in the city, but when I am there, the people are talking about the derby and even when I come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'My wife's hairdresser is a Manchester City fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women. 'I like it. You play football for the fans and I hope we can give our fans the victory.' Bragging rights are not the only thing at stake. Victory would strengthen United's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their 'noisy neighbours'. A third-placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the Champions League and that is what Van Gaal is aiming for. 'When you win, third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that, besides me, of course,' Van Gaal said. 'Third is good because you are certainly qualified for the Champions League and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season.' Chris Smalling was sent off during his side's defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in November . Smalling is heckled by Manchester City supporters as he makes his way off the field . The fact that United and City are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been. But Van Gaal has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year, after making a few additions to his squad. 'I want to improve my selection for the next season. Then we can make a bigger step,' he said. 'Sir Alex Ferguson has done it before. Jose Mourinho is doing it now. 'Last season he didn't win anything. Now he is winning the title, now I try to do that also.' United's run of five straight league victories has moved them above City, who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions. The fact that City have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the Dutchman though. 'That's not my history,' he said. 'The last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history.' Chris Smalling was the man who was dismissed at the Etihad Stadium. The defender earned his first booking for blocking Joe Hart as he went to kick the ball out of his hands, and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down James Milner. Van Gaal will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend. He said: 'In such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then, so I hope we have learned from that moment. 'We have had five red cards this year. It's a record in my career as a manager and that's not good.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nArsenal are the form team in Europe at present, winning 10 games out of their last 11, including seven in a row. Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley . Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track . For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track . Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''",

But the gas station owner never made it on a flight back to his home Hayward, California. Family members have identified him as a victim killed in mortar strike last week in the southern Yemeni city of Aden. He is believed to be the first U.S. citizen killed in the current violence in Yemen. Early Tuesday evening, the 45-year-old al-Labani was on his way back from mosque prayers when he was hit in the back by shrapnel from a mortar shell, his family said. He died minutes later. Violence quickly escalated in Yemen soon afer al-Labani arrived in February. \"When he got (to Aden), after a few weeks he noticed things were starting to get bad and then the (U.S.) Embassy closed,\" his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told CNN. For the past three weeks, al-Labani had told family members he was concerned about not being able to evacuate as the situation deteriorated in the country, according to his cousin. More than 200 people have been killed in Aden in the past 11 days, according to Naef Al Bakri, Aden's deputy governor. Two days before al-Labani was killed, he told his family the last option was to try to cross the border into Oman and fly to Egypt, but he never made it. \"The airports got closed and things got worse and worse,\" Alazzani told CNN by phone. \"People were hoping things would get better, but they only got worse and worse.\" Yemen has been rocked by violence and political turmoil for months. Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, placing him under house arrest and taking over Sanaa, the country's capital. Hadi escaped in February, fled to the southern city of Aden and said he remained President. He fled to Saudi Arabia last month as the rebels and their military allies advanced on Aden. Now the violence is intensifying as Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations target the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. Yemeni-Americans are trapped in the conflict, but haven't gotten enough help from the U.S. government, the Council on American-Islamic Relations told CNN Sunday. Zahra Billoo, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group, said it's helping al-Labani's family and the families of other Yemeni-Americans. \"All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp,\" Billoo said. Responding to the criticism, the U.S. State Department told CNN that there are no current plans to evacuate private U.S. citizens from Yemen. \"We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. U.S. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available,\" a spokesman for the State Department told CNN in a statement. \"Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.\" Yemeni-American advocates think more could be done. \"There have been travel warnings to Yemen for a few years now. What's not clear is, are they saying 'Be cautious' or 'Don't go at all'?\" Billoo asked. \"It still it doesn't sit well with many of us civil rights lawyers who believe that U.S. citizenship should be the ultimate protection.\" Fierce fighting continued across Yemen on Sunday amid an electrical blackout in parts of the country and political moves that could further fracture the already divided military. Intense airstrikes hit Sanaa overnight. Senior security officials in the Yemeni capital said the airstrikes targeted the military intelligence headquarters and the Defense Ministry's central command, military bases and missile depots. The blasts at the military compounds, which are inside the city, shattered the windows of many homes nearby. Meanwhile, some 16 million Yemenis living in provinces under control of Houthi rebels, including Sanaa, remained without power after an electrical blackout that began Saturday night. In the country's south, the Houthis remain in control of Aden's port and other strategic holdings, including the state broadcaster. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Sunday that Saudi Arabia has signed off on the delivery of medical supplies and personnel to Yemen, where the organization had warned that time was running out to save those wounded in airstrikes and ground fighting.

They become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they're paintings, and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them. Patrick Kramer is a 33-year-old artist hailing from Springville, Utah, who specialises in remarkably hyper-realistic paintings. Scroll down for video . Action shot: The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it's impossible to tell apart from a photo. In this image, he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits, including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called Matt . The paintings, including this of a sleeping young girl called Anna, take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . It's almost impossible to tell that Kramer's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity. His portrayals vary between vivid city scenes, still-life objects, portraits and breathtaking motion-shots. As well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings, he also constructs more surreal variations on still life, involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background. One of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician Drake's 2013 album, Nothing Was the Same. Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots, which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . His technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . The US artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas. This allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing, which appear almost three-dimensional in the pieces of artwork. Kramer has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours (one to six weeks) to complete. The length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail.\u00a0The 33-year-old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality. Kramer also constructs more surreal imagery of insects, which all still have the same high level of detail - including (left) a dragonfly on an intricate background, and (right)\u00a0Kramer's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters . Cracks in the surface: The artist, from Utah, specialises in creating exceptionally-realistic works of art. In this case, it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint . Kramer said: 'Being a perfectionist, I have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality. The artist's background and education was also important in honing his interests. 'I studied painting in college, and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft. 'I never intended to pursue the style, but found it hard to give up, as it suited my nature.' Kramer's artwork - including this painting of half-filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity . Glass half full or half empty? This painting is incredibly detailed, from the fine fish fins to the bubble floating at the top of the glass . Kramer's paintings can vary between still-life of subjects such as paint-brushes (left) and detailed portrayals, such as this harbour (right) Nothing Was the Same: This painting imitates the album cover art for Drake's 2013 album, but swaps Drake for a female model .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)On April 20, 2010, a final cement seal of an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico failed, causing what has been called the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history and taking the lives of 11 rig workers. For 87 straight days, oil and methane gas spewed from an uncapped wellhead, 1 mile below the surface of the ocean. The federal government estimated 4.2 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf, but BP argued in court that it was much lower. A judge ruled BP was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels. Imagining Daddy: A rig worker's daughter and her dreams . There were dire predictions of what would follow. Environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale. Scientists continue to study environmental impacts, but five years after the spill, the long-term negative effects remain unclear and are, in many cases, highly disputed. BP, the company that caused the spill, is eager to point out it appears the Gulf of Mexico is healing itself. BP's vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, said there is no doubt birds, fish, turtles, sub-sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. \"There's no question about that,\" Morrell said. \"But they have also, according to the data, bounced back and are recovering strongly.\" \"And there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\" While BP's assessment has not been disproven, the government suggests it's too soon to make long-term conclusions about the rebounding health of the Gulf. Shortly after BP released its own five-year report that concluded the Gulf has largely recovered, the trustees of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment called BP's report \"inappropriate as well as premature.\" The trustees, a collection of government agencies tasked with determining the extent of the damage from the Macondo spill, released a statement, saying, \"We know that the environmental effects of this spill are likely to last for generations.\" One government official familiar with the trustee's assessment accused BP of having \"cherry-picked\" positive results while ignoring others, something BP denies. Most long-term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed. Studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill, but others show some of those species are bouncing back. Fish landings in the Gulf, the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry, have returned. Oysters are also recovering in many areas. And according to the Food and Drug Administration, tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region's food supply. The spill's effects on other species are less clear. Dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the Gulf Coast, and even more so in Louisiana where the oil hit the hardest. But the dolphin \"mortality event,\" as the government calls it, began months before the spill. Studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like Barataria Bay, Louisiana, could be caused by oil exposure, but direct links to the 2010 Macondo spill have not been proven. Seaside sparrows in the Gulf are also showing signs of strain, and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance. While aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters, government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long-term effects on sea turtle populations. But perhaps the greatest unknown is what, if anything, millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the Gulf itself. Oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the Macondo well as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean. Mandy Joye, an oceanographer with the University of Georgia, has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled. Her research and other studies show BP's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor. According to Joye's study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others. Joye is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor -- estimated to be about 10 million gallons -- affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean. \"That stuff's not going to stay put. It's going to move around, \" Joye said. She said that right now, there is just no way to tell if it will have an impact. \"There's so much that we don't know,\" Joye said. BP doesn't accept the results of Joye's work. The company said its oil is all accounted for and only exists in two places: within a 2 kilometer area around the wellhead and in tar mats and tar balls that have yet to be cleaned up on the beach. And according to BP's Morrell, the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful. \"So much time has passed that it no longer has any toxicity and is therefore not a threat to humans or aquatic life,\" Morrell said. Ocean conservationist Philippe Cousteau witnessed much of the spill's aftermath in 2010, but when he returned to the Gulf to dive near an oil rig last month, he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks, hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw. During the same trip, however, Cousteau spotted a mother dolphin trying to revive a dead calf. It is unknown if its death had anything to do with the oil. Cousteau commended the progress community groups and restoration projects have made since the spill, but he said he believes it's far too early to say the Gulf is back and the oil is gone. \"It is still in many cases in the sand, along the shoreline, in the marshes,\" Cousteau said, \"and existing on a microscopic scale that we may not be able to see with the naked eye.\" CNN's David Matthews contributed to this report.",

But that was just the start for Hillary Clinton's most trusted aide Huma Abedin. And so, relishing her final taste of freedom before the presidential campaign kicks off, the notoriously low-profile staffer enjoyed a family day out in New York - with another Mexican bite. The 38-year-old was spotted with her husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, and two-year-old son Jordan tucking into her second spicy menu of the week on Saturday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Before the campaign heats up: Hillary Clinton's aide Huma Abedin (left) was spotted grabbing a Mexican lunch with husband Anthony Weiner and three-year-old son Jordan at quaint Tortaria in New York on Saturday . Low profile: Weiner (second left) and Adebin wore baseball caps as they enjoyed their lunch with their son. Weiner had swung his cap backwards for the dining portion . Skipping Chipotle: Their restaurant of choice was two doors down from the popular fast food Mexican diner . Abedin and Clinton were seen ordering a burrito bowl and a salad in an Iowa Chipotle this week but came under fire after staff complained Abedin did not put any change in the tip jar. Chipotle does not always have tip jars . The family was pictured inside at a table, where Weiner swung his New York Mets baseball cap backwards while he ate. It is just a few days after Abedin and Clinton were spotted, sunglasses on, in an Iowa branch of fast food favorite Chipotle. Grabbing a burrito bowl and a salad, the pair dashed back out to the 'Scooby Van' - and failed to pay a tip. This time, with her boss out of sight, Abedin side-stepped Chipotle and opted instead for a more upmarket eatery next door: Tortar\u00eda. Weiner and Abedin both wore baseball caps in the restaurant off Union Square, where tortas range from $7.50 to $11. As well as food served at the table, customers can also buyMexican fare to use at home. Weiner, a former congressman, fell from grace after sending explicit images to women over Twitter.

It is the furthest outreach of the Masurian Lakes (Poland\u2019s Lake District), and the most sparsely populated. Our base is an unassuming but pristine hotel right on the Wigry lakeshore. The National Park snuggles around it, a mass of primeval forest and waterways that are home to otter and beaver, wolf and elk. The area is unspoiled, but it is also exceedingly well set-up for outdoorsy pursuits. The hotel rents mountain bikes and Nordic walking poles, and you could cycle or hike for days around the well-marked trails.

Ask the wrong question and you find your interviewee walking out on you mid sentence. Which is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter\u00a0Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past. After questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life . In the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room. The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat . But Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning. Naomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives. Justin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake. And Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life.

The model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been given . NAOMI CAMPBELL . In April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way. The reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor. Naomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.' The interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off. In court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him. Robert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart . ROBERT PATTINSON . When Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest. Ryan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart. Ryan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host. Rob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off. As Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension. Justin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum . JUSTIN BIEBER . In 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning. The host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake. Justin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.' He then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles. The presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...' The radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back. Peter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears . PETER ANDRE . In 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid. In particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married. Which lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day. During the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact. An understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son. Kay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated. Rihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love life . RIHANNA . Rihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise. During an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them. To which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.' She went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview. It wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR . S CLUB 7 . In one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR. It was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money. It had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money. Claudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..' The bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.' The Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short . BEE GEES . It's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees. Clive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'

The U.S. spends $4billion (\u00a32.7billion) a year on unnecessary medical costs due to mammograms generating false alarms and on treatment for breast tumors unlikely to cause problems, a new report has revealed. The study, published in the Health Affairs journal on Monday, has estimated the figure for women aged 40 to 59. It is made up of $2.8bn resulting from false-positive mammograms and another $1.2bn attributed to breast cancer overdiagnosis -treatment of tumors that grow slowly or not at all and are unlikely to develop into life-threatening disease. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer among American women, claiming nearly 41,000 lives a year. Annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care, because cancer is easier to treat if detected early. But recently there has been disagreement about regular screening for women in their 40s. Study authors Mei-Sing Ong, a research fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, and Kenneth Mandl, a professor at Harvard Medical School, say their findings indicate that the cost of breast cancer overtreatment appears to be much higher than previously estimated. Their $4bn figure is the midpoint of a range that depends upon assumptions about the rates of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnosis. Apart from the financial cost of screening tests and treatment, false positives and overdiagnosis expose women to risks from additional medical procedures, not to mention psychological distress. It is not uncommon for mammograms to turn up some apparent abnormality that has to be resolved with more imaging tests or a biopsy. 'We're hoping that the financial cost of this problem will help cast into greater relief the human cost,' said  Mandl. 'The two messages together are powerful. The fact that this is not only a problem, but a very costly problem we hope will accelerate the attempts to try to fix the screening practices.' But another expert defended those practices, and called the study one-sided. 'There was no attempt to balance the costs with the benefits,' said Richard Wender, who heads prevention, detection and patient-support efforts at the American Cancer Society. 'I strongly feel that every study that looks at the downsides of any screening test has to be balanced with the benefits.' The American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group - the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force - recommends that regular screening begins at 50. The study found that women aged 40 and 49 were more likely to have a false-positive mammogram, compared to women in their 50s. Early detection: Annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care, because cancer is easier to treat if detected early . The American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group says regular screening should begin at 50 . Wender questioned the assumptions behind the new study, saying that the authors made a 'very selective choice of estimates' for the rates of false positives and overdiagnosis. 'There is no debate about the benefits of mammography,' he said. Mandl responded that the assumptions in his study are supported by other research, and that by definition there is no medical benefit to mammograms that produce false-positive results. The study was based on billing data from a major U.S. insurer, including more than 700,000 women aged between 40 and 59 in all 50 states, from 2011 through 2013. The U.S. spends much more on healthcare than any other country, but lags behind other economically advanced societies on life expectancy and certain other health indicators. That has prompted strong interest among insurers, employers and government officials in comparing the effectiveness of competing treatments, tests and medications. Cancer treatment may end up being one of the most closely followed issues in the broader debate over healthcare costs and benefits. A different study also published in Monday's Health Affairs found that cancer death rates were lower in countries that spent more on cancer care, and that countries that increased spending the most made more progress in reducing death rates.",

Police across Malawi have been ordered to shoot anyone caught attacking albinos, while Tanzania's prime minister has urged citizens to kill anyone found with albino body parts. And in nearby Burundi, albino youngsters from across East Africa are being housed in special accommodation under army protection in a bid to deter attackers. Scroll down for video . Dorothy Mausen, a 22-year-old Malawian albino woman, poses for a photo in the country's Machinga district . Malawian police have been ordered to crack down on those trading in albino body parts, with orders recently given to shoot anyone caught attacking them . The drastic developments come as the United Nations reports at least 15 people with albinism, mostly children, have been killed, wounded, abducted or kidnapped in East Africa in the past six months. Body parts of those with albinism are prized in black magic and witchcraft, as it is believed spells based on their body parts will bring luck, love and wealth. Nearby Burundi has also taken steps to safeguard albinos by accommodating them in housing under protection. The latest order came from Malawi's Inspector General of Police Lexen Kachama who instructed police to shoot any 'dangerous criminals' caught abducting albinos, according to local media reports. 'Shoot every criminal who is violent when caught red-handed abducting people with albinism,' said Kachama, adding that he was ordering police to use weapons in proportion to the crime. 'We cannot just watch while our friends with albinism are being killed like animals every day. 'We do realize that these people are ruthless, have no mercy and therefore they need to be treated just like that.' His comments came just a month after a Malawian man was arrested for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy. Catherine Amidu, 12, sits in her home Malawian home, in a region where six albinos have been killed since December .

Village chief Mariam Witness stands in a graveyard where the grave of an albino person was recently desecrated. Body part traders are known to exhume graves in order to obtain body parts in the cruel trade . A similar remark was made by Tanzania's Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda in 2009 when he urged citizens to kill anyone on the spot if they were found with the limbs or organs of albinos. Albino rights group have called for greater protection of albinos but said killing suspects was not going to deter criminals offered large sums of money for securing body parts as they were likely to still take the risk for the promised reward. Witchdoctors will pay as much as $75,000 for a full set of albino body parts, according to a Red Cross report. Vicky Ntetema, executive director of Under The Same Sun, a Canadian non-profit organization defending albino rights, said campaigners wanted justice for those people kidnapped, mutilated and murdered. 'But we have to remember that all those goons caught red-handed ... are small fish - agents and executors of the big sharks out there,' she said. 'Killing them on the spot is not going to help us catch the inducers, those with money to hire these gangs who continue to terrorize innocent people with albinism and their families.' An albino boy sits between his two parents at their home in Malawi . Ntetema urged police in Tanzania, Malawi and Burundi to quiz suspects to get information about the witchdoctors who use albino body parts and their clients. 'We all need to unite and find the culprits who are hiding behind the killers ... Why would people kill albinos if they were not asked to get their organs by someone?' she said. The plight of people with albinism has worsened in East Africa in recent years, according to U.N. and police figures, with concerns that an election in Tanzania this year will prompt more attacks as politicians seek luck at the ballot box. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Said Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein last month urged African governments to combat impunity for crimes against people with albinism. Albinism is a congenital disorder which affects about one in 20,000 people worldwide, according to medical authorities. It is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and affects about one Tanzanian in 1,400.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nRobbie Neilson insists the likes of captain Danny Wilson will only leave Hearts if he is satisfied it's right for the club. As Sportsmail revealed this week, Celtic have placed former Rangers defender Wilson on a list of potential summer recruits. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Championship clash with the Ibrox club, Neilson admitted external interest in his promoted players is inevitable. Hearts manager Robbie Neilson will not sell his players unless it is the right move for the club . Echoing the view of owner Ann Budge, however, the Tynecastle coach says departures will only happen on his say-so if the price is right. 'If you do really well in the Championship and the players excel then there is going to be interest,' admitted Neilson. 'That is football. 'There has been interest in a lot of my players and we have a few boys out of contract, who we are negotiating with at the moment. 'I would like to try to keep my best players but there is a realisation that bigger clubs can come in and take them. 'What I would say is: I wouldn't expect to lose anyone that I don't want to lose. If there are people I want to keep, I expect to keep them. Hearts have already secured promotion to the Scottish Premiership under Neilson's stewardship . 'If teams come in with an offer that is acceptable to us, then I'll expect to lose them. 'What I don't expect to happen is someone moves on and we are not happy about it. If someone leaves the club then it will be on terms that are acceptable to the club and the player.' Parkhead coach Ronny Deila admitted Wilson, a one-time \u00a32million signing for Liverpool, is on his list of potential replacements for Jason Denayer and Virgil van Dijk, linked with Sunderland and Southampton. With a shrug of resignation, Neilson added: 'People talk about how comments from other managers can unsettle you. I think it gives you a boost, because you realise that teams admire you and are interested in you. 'When no team is interested in you... that is what unsettles you. You start worrying when nobody is talking about you. If there is interest in players then it just shows that they are doing really well. 'Big clubs talk, but I would like to think the majority of players have enjoyed their season here and would like to have a good crack at the top league. This is a great place to play and, if they do leave, then they must be really careful about where they go.' Owner Ann Budge has set Neilson and his players the target of a top-six finish in the top flight next season . Neilson, alongside director of football Craig Levein, is more focused on bringing new players into Hearts than losing the ones he has. Defender Adam Eckersley is out of contract, with talks to keep him ongoing. 'It is a case of getting things ironed out, really,' continued Neilson. 'There are also players I want to bring in who I am in talks with. The squad needs to change. 'I can't keep the same squad and expect to have the same impact at a higher level. Players will come in, players will go out and things will continue to evolve. Hopefully at the end of it we have a better team than we do now.' With six games of the Championship season to go and promotion already secured, Neilson already knows his targets for his second season as a manager. Speaking at the announcement of a ground-breaking sponsorship deal with charity Save the Children, Budge set her sights on a top-six finish in the Premiership. Captain Danny Wilson has been linked with Celtic, but won't be sold unless it is the right move for Hearts . Accepting the challenge, Neilson said: 'That is a target and life is all about setting yourself targets. I think getting into the top six is a reasonable aim. 'We have good players here already and we will be recruiting again over the summer to get better players in again. 'We have bags of confidence and a massive fanbase, which has backed us to the hilt. We have to aim for the top six. 'That is just the nature of the beast as head coach of a big football club - you need to meet the standards. To be honest, a top-six finish for a club like Hearts - if they had not been in the Championship - would be the bare minimum which should be acceptable.' To that end, there has been no let-up since securing promotion. Hearts players were shocked to be saddled with a triple training session this week despite securing their promotion goal with something to spare. The former Rangers defender (right, pictured against his former club) could join Celtic in the summer . Unbeaten away from home this season, Neilson wants that record to continue at Ibrox, where his side laid down a marker on the first day of the season. 'We had a triple session and, although we weren't out for too long, we were working hard for Sunday,' he revealed. 'We can't just think that we can down tools because we have won the league. 'We have six games and you simply have to win games at Hearts. 'We are not going to take our foot off the gas. It would be easy to just play games in training and say: \"Let's have a jolly up for the week\". 'When you do that, you lose focus and lose sight of what a big game Sunday is. It is a chance to go to Ibrox as champions and hopefully get a result.' Ironically, a third victory of the season over a Rangers side showing signs of improvement under Stuart McCall would benefit arch city rivals Hibernian the most. Of the view Hearts must win games for themselves rather than others, however, Neilson insisted: 'We don't owe that to any other teams - we owe it to ourselves and the fans, for our own personal pride. We have sold out our allocation on Sunday and everyone is paying good money to come and watch us. We need to give everything. It is not fair if we don't perform.'",

Poles are waiting to see if Comey would issue an apology \u2014 something that hadn't happened by late Monday. Polish Foreign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna said he expected him to say sorry so the matter can be settled. Comey said last week, 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do. That's what people do. And that should truly frighten us.' FBI director James Comey, pictured at a news conference last month,  has caused huge offense to a U.S. ally by using language to suggest that Poles were accomplices in the Holocaust . Comey's comments are particularly offensive to Poles not only because they had no role in running Auschwitz and other death camps where Jews were murdered during World War II, but because they were themselves victims of the Third Reich. In all, 6 million Polish citizens were killed during the war, about half of them Jewish and the other half Christians, with many Polish priests, members of the intelligentsia and political resistance killed in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Poland also had a committed anti-Nazi resistance movement and Polish fighters fought alongside the Allies throughout the war. Poles see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized, making comments like Comey's hurt even more. Comey originally delivered the remarks on Wednesday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in arguing for the importance of Holocaust education. The speech was adapted for an article published in The Washington Post on Thursday. U.S. Ambassador Stephen Mull attends ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in front of the monument to the Heroes of the Ghetto, in Warsaw, Poland, on Sunday, April 19, 2015 . The Polish reaction was swift. On Sunday, the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Stephen Mull, was called to the Foreign Ministry in a formal act of protest on the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Mull, a well-liked figure in Poland, went into damage-control mode. 'Saying that Poland and any other country other than Nazi Germany were responsible for the Holocaust is a mistake, is harmful and is offensive,' Mull said. 'Director Comey certainly did not mean to suggest that Poland was in any way responsible for those crimes.' In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf later echoed that sentiment, saying that 'Poles certainly bore a huge brunt of the barbarism of Nazi Germany.' 'Director Comey certainly did not intend to suggest otherwise, did not intend to suggest that Poland was in some way responsible for the Holocaust,' she said. The FBI had no immediate comment on the matter. Polish leaders all had something to say about the controversy. 'To those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of World War II,' Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said on Sunday. 'I would expect full historical knowledge from officials who speak on the matter.' Not all Poles behaved heroically during the war. Anti-Semitism was deep in the 1930s and some Poles pointed Jews out to the Nazis, who often could not tell Jew from non-Jew. There were also some cases of Poles murdering Jews during the war. But collaborating was never the official state position, as it was with Vichy France, for instance. In fact, during the war, the Polish underground army had a program to save Jews, called Zegota. And Poles caught denouncing Jews to the Nazis were even killed by the Polish resistance. President Barack Obama caused a similar controversy in 2012 when he used the wording 'Polish death camp.' Poles feel that that wording implies Polish complicity, and Obama later expressed 'regret' for the gaffe. 'In referring to 'a Polish death camp' rather than 'a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland,' I inadvertently used a phrase that has caused many Poles anguish over the years and that Poland has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world,' Obama wrote at the time. 'I regret the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations know the truth.' The entrance to the Auschwitz death camp in Oswiecim, Poland. There was a Polish program to save Jews, called Zegota, and Poles caught denouncing Jews to the Nazis were even killed by the Polish resistance .",

The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side . Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe . Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 . Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone . Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. \u2018I could be nasty about Michael because let\u2019s not forget what happened when he was here,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018But listen, I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. \u2018They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where\u2019s that come from?\u201d.\u2019 He added: \u2018Let\u2019s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven\u2019t. I understand that. \u2018But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. \u2018There are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. \u2018It\u2019s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don\u2019t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don\u2019t see that.\u2019 Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. \u2018I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,\u2019 said United\u2019s head coach. \u2018And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.\u2019 Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea . Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The \u00a36million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game. But Carver said: \u2018You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, \u201cWhat a player he is\u201d. \u2018If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer. We just have to be patient with him.\u2019 Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having \u00a334million in the bank .",

The dish loved by millions of British customers is to get a meat-free makeover that it is claimed will cut carbon emissions by half. The Swedish firm says producing the new version uses far less energy than making the pork and beef variety. Green scheme: IKEA claims it will 'save the planet' with its new vegetarian meatballs as  far less energy is needed both to produce and cook them than the pork and beef variety . Its veggie balls will be rolled out this month, created from a secret recipe of chickpeas, peas, carrots, peppers, corn, kale and seasoning. Ikea is as famous for its meatballs as its cheap self-assembly furniture and UK customers often spend entire days inside its large warehouses eating and shopping. The company now sells a staggering one billion of its regular meatballs every year. In an interview with the Daily Mail, IKEA chief executive, Peter Agnefjall, said: \u2018We are launching a vegetarian meatball. We see a big opportunity. The vegetarian meatball will go global in April and have 50pc less carbon dioxide than a normal meatball. It\u2019s healthier and better for the planet.\u2019 The firm has spent two years developing the veggieball, the first innovation to its meatball since it started selling food to encourage shoppers to stay inside its stores back in 1959. The vegetable-based snack is more environmentally friendly than the meat version, because cows and pigs are responsible for methane emissions. It also takes less energy to cook a veggieball. A spokesman said: \u2018At IKEA we want to offer healthy food choices that are delicious, sustainable and affordable for the many, based on our Swedish identity. \u2018We are currently developing our food range to provide options that meet the different preferences of our customers. \u2018One of the exciting new products is a veggieball which will be launched in our stores from April onwards. \u2018The veggie ball does not have any animal content in the ingredients. We will share more information about our new veggieballs nearer the time of the launch.\u2019 Meatballs are one of Sweden\u2019s national dishes and as iconic as Volvo cars or the pop group Abba.

IKEA sells 5million meatballs in the UK annually and estimates it has sold 11.6billion in the UK since 1987. However a spokesman said last night the veggieball will not be available in the UK until May. Food contributed \u00a31 billion to group sales last year. IKEA has 361 stores worldwide which all sell food \u2013 its meatball even has its own Facebook page. Meatballs are sold in Ikea\u2019s restaurants for \u00a33.80 and customer can also buy a frozen variety in its Swedish Food Market for \u00a34.35 for 1kg. It has not yet revealed the cost of the veggieball. Ikea was caught up in the international food fraud scandal in 2013 when it emerged there was more than just beef and pork in its meatballs. Tests showed that there was also a significant amount of pony and horse. The business was started by billionaire Ingvar Kamprad, 88, who started selling matches in the 1920s. The IKEA name comes from his initials along with the name of the family farm Elmtaryd which was located in the local village of Agunnaryd. His third store in Stockholm was designed to be round so customers did not cut corners whilst walking around. The flat packed idea came while shipping a table by rail. It had been damaged in transit so the idea to separate the legs was hatched to protect it. Shipping it flat was also cheaper.",

Web users suggested the fence was put up by school authorities to prevent more pupils from jumping off the building, the People's Daily Online\u00a0reports. Hengshui No 2 Middle School is an 'exemplary school' in Hebei Province in central China. With nearly 10,000 pupils and more than 500 teachers, the boarding school is well-known for its outstanding academic achievement. Behind bars: Hengshui No.2 Middle school is accused of making itself look like a prison in order to prevent students from committing suicide . A large number of the school's pupils are admitted by top universities every year, which inspires parents from across the country to send their children to study there in order to have a 'bright future'. Two pupils from the school plunged to death, one in October and one in March. Both were reported to be third-grade pupils, who were at their final year at Hengshui before taking the university entrance examination. Pictures of the school's new balcony fence first appeared last week on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. A Weibo user named 'Nicky Wu from the East' posted this set of images on April 16th. 'In order to prevent pupils from jumping off the building, Hengshui Middle School has spent a fortune,' wrote the user. Tragic:\u00a0Two pupils from the school have plunged to death since last October, causing public outcry . Another user named Mr Chen Zonghe commented: 'This is indeed a school, but in order to stop pupils from taking their lives, it has made itself look like a prison.' Causes of the two suicides were not officially reported by Chinese media, but many suspect they were linked to the aggressive teaching style the school is famous for. The campus is run with a military-style management. All students must get up at 5:30 and study 10 hours a day. All meals must be finished within 15 minutes and toilet breaks are less than three minutes, according to Xinhua News Agency. Students are given one holiday every three weeks. Stressful: Banners are hung throughout the campus to impress pupils that only success is allowed . Various videos online also show how the school trains pupils like exam machines. Banners are hung throughout the campus, bearing inspiring slogans such as 'key to the success of the university entrance examination is to succeed in every day, every subject and every question'. In an 'oath-taking ceremony' held for the third-grade, thousands of pupils are seen standing on the playground wearing uniforms yelling 'I must succeed' unanimously and repeatedly. The education authority of Hengshui told Chinese media they have noticed the pictures of the so called 'anti-suicide bars' in No 2 Middle School  and they are currently investigating the case.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nOfficially it's known as a 'forward three-and-a-half somersaults with one twist pike' but unofficially it's the 'firework' and Tom Daley hopes it's the dive that turns London bronze into Rio gold. The former world champion knows he needs to push the boundaries of his sport and spent most of last year battling to master his 'demon' dive, a dizzying combination of somersaults and twists he had hoped would prove the difference. However, along with new coach Jane Figueiredo he spent the winter modifying a new plunge, something that has never been attempted before. Daley spent long hours on the trampoline perfecting technique before building the dive in stages from different heights. Tom Daley hopes his new 'firework' dive can help win Olympic gold at the 2016 Rio de Janiero Games . It was painstaking and detailed work but the dive finally got its premiere at the British Championships and was part of Daley's repertoire when he won silver, with a personal best score, at the recent World Diving Series in Dubai. 'There was a sense of relief when we decided to bin the old dive but the pressure was on to come up with something,' admitted Daley. 'The old dive did terrify me and while I did conquer my demons with it, it's a weight off my shoulders that I've moved on because it was a bad dive for me. 'We wanted to do the least twist possible because I hate the twisting part. We've only got one twist in this dive so we had to decide whether we were going to do it at the beginning or at the end because you can do that dive three different ways. 'We tried doing it at the beginning but it made the dive really hard because the G-force getting into your pike shape is really difficult. 'We go through 20 Gs of force as we're spinning around so at the end we decided to do it on the way out. So you spin as fast as you can and then you come out at the end, do one twist then land in the water.' Daley (right) has spent\u00a0the winter modifying the plunge with his\u00a0new coach Jane Figueiredo . It's six years since Daley won his breakthrough world title in Rome, one year after making his Olympic debut as a 14-year old in Beijing. Last year there were inaccurate reports that Daley was to call time on his diving career but he insists he's enjoying the sport more than ever, following the decision to relocate from Plymouth to London. His home pool is now the Olympic pool, a place with happy memories, and he'll be the star attraction at next month's FINA Diving World Series, 1-3 May in his newly-adopted hometown. But Daley is no longer the sole standard bearer for British diving, Jack Laugher became the first non-Chinese diver to win on the World Series this year in Dubai and Tonia Couch and synchro partner Sarah Barrow are also established among the world's elite. 'I have never loved diving as much as I do now and I want to stay in diving for as long as I possibly can,' added Daley. The 20-year-old says he is enjoying diving more than ever after relocating from Plymouth to London . 'With the move to London it has become exciting again. Especially with the new dive, there are new challenges and new obstacles to overcome. 'It's been great having Jane on board, we've had a year and three months working together now. 'There's little things that we've changed \u2013 the strength and conditioning, the way that we work in the pool, the way we work in the gym but it's really working out. 'British diving is the strongest it's ever been and we are all really excited about coming back to London and competing in our own pool. 'We know in London that we always get a crowd that's loud. It's normally a sell-out and the atmosphere is a bit more electric than anyone else, it gives you that extra adrenaline rush and, in theory, it should get us to dive a little bit better.' And Daley hopes his new dive will bring victory at next month's FINA Diving World Series in London . But Daley's key ambition for the season in this summer's World Championships in Kazan. Since striking gold in Rome, he has settled for a fifth and sixth at the event, a record he concedes must change. His rivals will be the normal suspects, reigning champion Qiu Bo, Olympic champion David Boudia and Germany's Sascha Klein. 'The build up to Rio is going pretty well,' he added. 'It's got a lot of competitions leading up to it and the worlds will be our first chance to qualify. 'London is one of the key parts of the diving calendar this year because it's the middle part of the World Series. So it's a really good marker to see how the new dive's going and how all of that is piecing together and it's exactly the half-way mark competition wise so I'm really looking forward to it.'

Julia Ware, who was 15 at the time of the accident, appeared at Wayne County Court in Honesdale, Pennslyvania, on Wednesday. The families of Shamus Digney, Cullen Keffer and Ryan Lesher \u00a0- who were all 15 - watched her admit to five of the 12 counts she was charged with by prosecutors. After the hearing was over, a grieving father branded Ware, of Pleasantville, New York, a murderer. Scroll down for video . Julia Ware (center)\u00a0accepted responsibility for three homicide by vehicle felony counts in a Pennsylvania court . Shamus Digney (left), Cullen Keffer (center) and Ryan Lesher (right), all 15, were killed during the accident . Lisa Lesher held a picture of her son Ryan as she entered the Wayne County Courthouse on Wednesday . The tenth grader accepted responsibility for three felony counts of homicide by vehicle and  two misdemeanor counts of accident involving death or injury. She struggled with her emotions throughout the proceedings and tried to avoid eye contact. Her father, Michael Ware, is awaiting trial on three counts of involuntary manslaughter, endangering the welfare of children and other charges for allegedly allowing Ware to drive, the Bucks County Courier Times\u00a0reported. A written statement from Ware claimed the man gave her permission to drive so she could go pick up breakfast, according to the Times-Tribune. No trial date is set for the 53-year-old. Ware will be back in court within a month for the juvenile equivalent of sentencing and there are some who feel she should be treated as an adult. Ware was speeding when she lost control and her SUV rolled over\u00a0in Paupack Township back in August . The father of one of the dead boys, Ed Lesher, said: 'She knew she was wrong. 'She knew she shouldn't have been driving. She knew she was going fast. 'The boys were telling her to slow down. She didn't slow down. 'She thought it was funny to go faster. She murdered three boys, one of them my son Ryan. 'She should be punished like her father.' The dead boys' loved ones wore shirts that had CRS written on the back in honor of Cullen, Ryan and Shamus . Family and friends of the three dead Council Rock High School South students carried signs and photos . Ware, who is now 16, will be back in court within a month or so for the juvenile equivalent of sentencing . Family and friends of the three dead Council Rock High School South students showed up at court wearing identical shirts and carrying signs and photos in honor of their loved ones. The shirts had CRS written on the back in honor of Cullen, Ryan and\u00a0Shamus. One sign read: 'Be a parent to your child before being a friend.' Another said: 'Charge Julia Ware as an Adult.' During the crash, which occurred over Labor Day weekend in Paupack Township, two other passengers in Ware's 2001\u00a0Chevrolet Suburban were injured,\u00a0WNEP\u00a0reported. Police think the unlicensed driver was speeding when she lost control of the SUV. It rolled over several times during the deadly accident. John Stieh, who represented Ware, said: '[The Ware family has] done nothing but express the deepest of sorrows since this happened. 'You saw the torment that girl had today. You saw the upset.' The seven other offenses Ware was originally charged with were dropped after her admissions.",

Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma to the head in August 2013 following a savage attack on a reservation in Saskatchewan. A 10-year-old boy, identified in court documents as L.T., reportedly admitted to killing Lee Bonneau and crushing his head after initially blaming a stranger for the slaying. Slain: Lee Allan Bonneau was 6 years old when in August 2013 he was attacked by a 10-year-old boy and beaten to death with a rock and a stick . Brief life: Lee was pronounced dead from severe head injuries four hours after he went missing in Saskatchewan, Canada, while in the care of his foster mother . Tribute: A collage created by Lee's biological family celebrating his short, troubled life . On Thursday, a coroner's jury in Regina heard how the underage suspect ran to his friends after the attack on Bonneau telling them he had witnessed a murder, reported National Post. The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also excited, telling his friends how a 'big guy' had struck Lee with a stick three times, pushed him down an embankment and then bashed him with a rock. L.T. then changed his story, according to Thursday's hearing, saying the he was the one who killed the 6-year-old. He then pleaded with his pals, 'Don't tell on me,' because he was afraid of being jailed. During an interview with investigators a day after Lee Bonneau's slaying August 21, 2013, L.T. reverted back to his original version of events, telling Royal Canadian Mounted Police that a 'big person' committed the crime. The 10-year-old named the purported killer and told law enforcement officials that he even walked up to the man and asked him what he was doing. 'I'm just killing a little boy,' L.T. quoted the man as saying. Police later questioned the person identified by L.T. and cleared him of any wrongdoing. On the evening of August 21, 2013, Lee Bonneau accompanied his foster mother, Mary Ramstead, to a bingo game at the Kahkewistahaw First Nation hall. At around 8pm, Lee stepped outside the bingo venue to buy snacks and never returned. He was last seen playing with some dogs and walking in the company of an older boy, later identified as 10-year-old L.T. More than two hours after his disappearance, Lee was found critically injured in a remote field more than half a mile from the bingo hall. A coroner's inquest has heard how a 10-year-old boy named L.T. attacked the younger child, pictured here as an infant on the evening of August 21, 2013 on a reservation . Family troubles: Lee was removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk (pictured) just two and a half months before his murder . Lee is pictured here with his birth father, Dave Bonneau. Child servers reportedly refused to release the 6-year-old into his parent's care . The 6-year-old was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries at around midnight. Forensic pathologist Dr Shaun Ladhman determined that Lee died from blunt force trauma to the left side of the head after suffering multiple skull fractures. In his testimony at the coroner's inquest Thursday, Ladhman compared the boy's injuries to those seen in high-speed car collisions or a three-story fall. Bonneau also had bite marks on his body. Because of his young age, 10-year-old L.T. has not been charged with Lee Bonneau's murder. Global News reported that Saskatchewan\u2019s children\u2019s advocate determined the underage killer had severe behavioral issues and likely required constant supervision. RCMP Cpl. Donna Zawislak testified court that when officers came to the child's house and said that Lee Bonneau has died, the 10-year-old did not react. The following day, L.T. sat down for a forensic interview, saying he had been a witness to the killing, not the perpetrator. When asked about the blood stains on his clothes and shoes, the 10-year-old blamed it on a nosebleed. The child had a history of troubling behavior, including a break-in where he killed a pregnant dog and her puppies, which had been cut out of the animal's body. Lee had been removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk, just two and a half months before his death citing concerns related to his verbal skills and behavioral problems. Violent end: A pathologist testified that 6-year-old Lee suffered injuries often observed in high-speed car collisions. He had multiple skull fractures and bite marks on his body . Lies:\u00a0The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also, telling his friends after the killing how a 'big guy' had struck Lee . Unpunished:\u00a0L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age . During the coroner\u2019s inquest, Ms Merk testified that a social worker became alarmed when she confided in her that she has been struggling with depression and had suicidal thoughts. On August 1, child services placed Lee with Mary Ramstead's family on a temporary basis. Three weeks later, the 6-year-old was murdered while in the care of his foster mother. L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age. The goal of the coroner's inquest is to determine the circumstances of the murder and make recommendations to prevent similar tragedies going forward.",

The figure, which equates to \u00a3183 an hour, was paid by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. It represents double the rate for a neurologist and was revealed following a Freedom of Information request. It also emerged there were 47 agency nurses working at the trust in December last year. The trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, has been criticised for wasting taxpayers' money. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust paid \u00a32,200 to a temporary nurse for one 12-hour shift to help amid a shortage of trained nurses, a Freedom of Information request revealed (file picture) Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be aghast at the cost of just one shift. 'Agency nurses are far more expensive than their regular counterparts and we have to minimise the number used. 'You can't open a newspaper without hearing how tight finances are in the NHS, but the service has to become far more efficient with the money it already has.' Edmund Stubbs, from independent think tank Civitas, added: 'It is evident that a lack of staff is leading to excessive spending on agency staff, locums and overseas recruitment.' A spokesman for the trust said the \u00a32,200 figure includes VAT, adding that the true figure paid to the nurse, including travel expenses, was \u00a31,864. The shift covered was one in specialist Intensive Therapy Unit on a Bank Holiday. Defending their spending, Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She highlighted their situation is one shared by many hospitals across the UK. She added: 'We have said consistently that we want to recruit more nurses to reduce our reliance on agency and temporary staff and this has been widely publicised with a number of recruitment events taking place recently to attract new staff. 'We have recruited, or made offers to, more than 150 staff nurses and health care assistants in recent months as part of our efforts to recruit more nursing staff to support our wards and departments. Defending the spend\u00a0Sarah Bloomfield, director of nursing at the trust, said\u00a0temporary staff had to be used to cover a shortfall in trained nurses. She said in recent months the hospitals have recruited more than 150 nurses and healthcare assistants . 'These new recruits have included a number who have been offered positions through a successful nursing recruitment event at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital just last week, which we will repeat again on Thursday. 'We\u2019ll continue our efforts to ensure that over the coming months we will see fewer agency nurses on our wards as our new starters get settled in, which will mean better continuity of care and more support for ward teams.' Figures obtained by the Nursing and Midwifery Council also revealed nearly a third of nursing recruits in the UK had to be sought abroad last year. NHS spending on temporary staff has rocketed to a staggering \u00a32.5 billion a year because of a chronic shortage of British nurses. The number of foreign nurses and midwives registered in the past 12 months grew to 8,200, up from just 6,200 a year earlier. Around 7,500 came from the EU - particularly Spain, Italy and Portugal - with others came from further afield, including the Philippines. It also emerged that 29 per cent of new nurses were recruited from abroad in the past 12 months, compared to 11 per cent five years ago.",

Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards . After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game . Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down . Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final . The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff. Spahic is seen breaking away from the clutches of two stewards to assist his friends in the melee . Footage shows Spahic seeming to throw his hands into the faces of some of the yellow-jacketed staff . After breaking free, the 34-year-old joins the melee and appears to throw his hands into the faces of multiple stewards before aiming a headbutt at another even when the brawl dies down. Spahic is expected to miss his side's trip to face Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday through injury but he could be in line for a longer spell on the sidelines if action is taken after the incident on Wednesday night. Bayer are fourth in the Bundesliga, two points behind Borussia Monchengladbach in the race for a Champions League place and trailing runaway leaders Bayern by 19 points. Spahic tackles Muller on Wednesday, and he has been one of Bayer's star performers so far this season . The Bosnian midfielder also appeared for his country during the recently international break against Austria .",

Now 87 years old, he was a 16-year-old Jewish recruit when he fought in the Soviet Red Army. As he fought the Nazis in World War II, his family fled. \"I did not show that I was Jewish,\" Margolin says. \"But it did not matter because people were being killed left and right. All around me.\" This year, in Ukraine, he found himself again surrounded by war. Margolin was a sniper who rose to be a commander in the army. His old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military. His granddaughter Liora still marvels at his stories from the war. She is amazed that he managed to survive. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative condition that impairs memory, he struggles to remember his own life sometimes, but he remembers the horrors of war. His eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word. Or perhaps the right memory. His hands shake ever so slightly. It seems he knows he has lived a life. He is just trying to remember all the details. \"People were hiding in shelters under the ground,\" Liora says of the stories Margolin once told. \"They were being shot at point blank range. It was terrible.\" \"[The Nazis] would have erased us from the Earth,\" Margolin remembers. \"They attacked us and we fought back.\" After the war, Margolin settled in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine. His family grew. He built a life. Then, decades later, he found himself in the middle of a war once again. \"A missile fell and the house was destroyed. We were attacked,\" Margolin says. \"A missile fell. I remember.\" Margolin's family lived in a neighborhood next to the Donetsk airport, near some of the most intense fighting in Eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists battled the Ukrainian army. Margolin, who had survived one war, was able to survive another, even as the stray missile hit his house on February 10. It spared him, but it killed his daughter Ira. \"The moment it happened, we decided that's it. Here and now, we're moving to Israel,\" says Liora. \"This is the safest place.\" Margolin arrived in Israel on March 24. Asked why the family waited to leave the war-torn region of Eastern Ukraine, Liora says they felt they would be fine in Donetsk, while Liora prayed for their safety from Israel. \"No matter how much we're afraid of the next war here and as much as it's not quiet here, it is the quietest place.\" Margolin came over in a wave of Ukrainian Jewish immigration to Israel that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in Eastern Ukraine. The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for Israel, has brought 600 Jews to Israel since December, Margolin among them. Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the fellowship's founder, says, \"We set up a refugee center. It's the first time since the Holocaust that the Jewish world has had to set up a refugee center for these Jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go.\" Among the Ukrainian Jews moving to Israel, Eckstein says they have worked with approximately a dozen Holocaust survivors. On Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day that commemorates the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews, these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy. Jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now. \"Most of the [Jewish] people in the Ukraine are Holocaust survivors or children of Holocaust survivors. These are the people who made it, who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the Holocaust.\" Margolin was one of these people, able to survive the Holocaust as a soldier in the Soviet Army. His story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes, but it is impossible for his family to forget. The voices of Auschwitz .",

That's the mayor's response to an artist's apology and offer to cover the cost of fixing the \"Scary Lucy\" statue that has put the New York town of Celoron in the spotlight this week. The bronze figure of comedian and area native Lucille Ball has elicited comparisons to a \"Walking Dead\" zombie and inspired the Facebook campaign \"We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue.\" The sculpture, a gift to the town from its original owners, has been on display since 2009. Artist Dave Poulin has \"had plenty of opportunity to step forward, and our last conversation he wanted $8,000 to $10,000,\" Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost said. \"And then he stated that if we didn't have the funds and we didn't like the statue, we should take it down and put it in storage.\" After the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend, Poulin publicly apologized Monday for his \"most unsettling sculpture\" in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter. \"I take full responsibility for 'Scary Lucy,' though by no means was that my intent or did I wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic Lucy image,\" Poulin wrote in the letter (PDF). \"From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy's beauty or my ability as a sculptor.\" Poulin said he has been talking to Celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture. It seems that cost has been the chief barrier. \"It puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community, they accept it, and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense.\" Poulin wrote in the letter. But the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind. \"I am willing to put my time and money into redoing the Lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years I can do a much better job,\" Poulin wrote. No thanks, Schrecengost said. He said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue. \"It would be reworked from the shoulders up -- the entire head, neck and shoulders, not just the face,\" Schrecengost said in a news release Tuesday. The town has set up a post office box for donations, which can also be made through Kickstarter. But the controversy may not be over. It seems that nearby Jamestown, New York, also has ties to Lucille Ball's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend. Schrecengost's Tuesday statement referred to an anonymous Facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising Jamestown's Lucille Ball profile at the expense of the Celoron statue. \"The best place for a life size statue of Lucy is right where it is now -- in Lucille Ball Memorial Park in her hometown, in the Village of Celoron, NY,\" he said.

Lorraine Valentine suffers from the rare disease erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight or UV light. A holiday abroad left the 42-year-old in hospital for six days, as the heat caused her entire body to swell. Her sun allergy means she has to keep herself completely covered, as even a small dose of sun on her skin leaves her in pain. In summer, everyday tasks like picking her children up from school or going to buy some milk become extremely difficult. Lorraine Valentine, 42,\u00a0calls herself the 'real life vampire' as she has a rare medical condition meaning she is allergic to the sun . Miss Valentine suffers from\u00a0erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight . Now, as temperatures in the UK are set to soar, she is desperate for a drug that can help her. Miss Valentine, of Bournemouth, said: 'It's always worst when the sun first comes out because I have no time to adjust. 'I have to pull the curtains closed and have to have a fan on, as any heat is painful.' She was first diagnosed with EPP, a rare blood condition which attacks the liver, when she was nine. The condition \u2013 which is incurable - is caused by a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and it can also cause the tissues to swell up. For Miss Valentine, even tasks like going to the supermarket are painful, as UV light reflects up from the floor, burning her skin. EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As . blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy . from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly . damage surrounding tissues.

'From March to November I completely cover up when I'm going to pick up the kids,' she said. 'When it's boiling hot and I'm wearing boots, jeans, a big cardigan, scarf and hat, I do get funny looks off the parents. 'They think I'm a bit strange. 'I try and do normal things and not let it affect me.' Her children. Chloe, 18, Elisha 14, Ben, 12 and Josh, 10, are understanding, but the family lives very close to the beach and so Miss Valentine feels guilty she cannot join them when the weather is good. She said: 'It was difficult for them growing up. 'When I was crying because I was in so much pain, they couldn't even hold my hand. 'The slightest touch puts me in agony.' 'They're understanding, but the beach is just ten minutes away. I should be on the beach with the kids, but I can't. 'I'm just trying not to get sunned on. 'Even driving somewhere, my arm is in pain from the sun coming through the window. 'I don't know what I'll do when it gets even hotter.' In June last year, Miss Valentine decided to take her children on a summer holiday to Lanzarote, as she didn't want them to miss out on this right of passage. She bought special UV protection socks to block out sunlight, and booked an expensive apartment right near the pool. She hoped this would mean she could stay indoors if she needed, but could watch her children enjoy swimming. She found the only way she could enjoy the holiday was to stay indoors, emerging at night to go to the beach and explore the town in the dark. 'We went in June because I thought it would be less hot, but how wrong I was,' she said. Last June, Miss Valentine went on a holiday to Lanzarote but was hospitalised for six days afterwards, as the sun irritated her skin. She must wait until the sun sets before going to the beach near her home (pictured) Miss Valentine, pictured on holiday with her 10-year-old son Josh, said her children are 'understanding' but when she is crying in pain they are unable to hold her hand, as any touch puts her in agony . 'Even though I stayed in the shade, I ended up being covered up and in pain wherever I went. 'I had to borrow a fan to sleep and spent most of the evenings in the toilets of the entertainment area putting cold water on my burning feet. 'The kids would give me the ice from their drinks to put on my feet.' When they flew back a week later, her ordeal wasn't over. She said: 'On the plane I cried, trying to sit there for four hours with the pain of the burns. I was in agony. 'I had the air hostesses get me ice in the end. I was in such pain, I was crying and so upset. 'I went through security and left the kids while I raced to get some cold water and some paper towels to try and ease the pain. Miss Valentine, pictured (left to right) with daughter Chloe, 18, Ben, 12, Josh, 10 and Elisha, 14, is now fundraising for other sufferers of the disease . Five hours later, when the family landed in the UK, Miss Valentine was admitted to hospital. She was kept in for six days as her liver wasn't functioning properly; the condition can cause liver damage in severe cases. Now, she is running the London Marathon for British Porphyria Association to help raise funds for other sufferers of the disease. She is hoping an experimental drug called Scenesse will bring hope for her and other sufferers. The drug acts as an anti-oxidant and activates melanin in skin, providing a barrier between the skin and wavelengths of light that trigger the burning and itching. 'I'll battle for this,' she said. 'I've suffered for so long and been through so much. There needs to be treatment available.'",

A married father-of-two is set to leave his home in Devon to fight against ISIS in Iraq because jihadis 'need to be put down like rabid dogs'. Steven Christopher Costa, 31, plans to head out to the Middle East next month to join the war against the terrorists, leaving his wife and young children behind. Mr Costa, who spent six years in the Navy, will make the 4,000-mile trip after raising the cash to pay for flights. He said: 'When you have a rabid dog, you take it to the vet and put it down. 'Lots of people have said it's an admirable thing I am doing. I think it's a necessary thing.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists. The former seaman was recruited through the Foreign Fighters Against ISIS Facebook group, who help ex-military personnel make the journey to ISIS-controlled territory. He has applied for a visa and plans to fly to northern Iraq via Jordan. Mr Costa said he will take his own life if he is ever captured by the terrorists because he does not want his children to see him being executed in a Jihadi John-style video. 'I will be saving a bullet or keeping a grenade strapped to my chest,' he said. 'If I get captured, I will pull the pin and take my life so there will be nothing for them to parade in any propaganda videos. 'I won't be burnt alive and I certainly won't be beheaded. I don't want my kids to see that in 10 years' time on the internet, because it will still be there. 'I am not going to lie, I am frightened. And anyone who says they are not is lying.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists (file picture) Previous attempts by people to go out to fight ISIS have led to them being arrested for terror offences, but Mr Costa says this will not happen to him. He said: 'I'm going to join the Kurdish Peshmerga - not a terror group - who some European countries are funding and sending weapons to. 'There are a few groups of former soldiers out there so I'll be fine. I'm going as a volunteer, not a mercenary, so I don't think I'll be stopped. I'm not being paid.' The former military man added:\u00a0'Not seeing my kids is my biggest fear before death. 'People are going to have to give their lives to stop ISIS and if one of them has to be me, then so be it. Mr Costa (pictured) will leave his wife and children behind to fight against ISIS for three months . 'I am not doing it for any monetary gain and I am not doing it for fame. 'My wife was not impressed when I told her, but she understands. 'The war that's happening over there will happen over here. It's just a matter of how long it will be before it comes here.' Steven said he aims to fight against the extremists for three months before returning to his family. 'If I have committed to something, I have to see it through,' he said. Otherwise it would bug me for the rest of my life.' Terror police warned Mr Costa against the trip but do not have the power to stop him leaving unless they suspect of him of carrying out an offence. Detective Sergeant Martin Lakey from the South West Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit, said: 'Whilst it is not illegal to travel to countries such as Syria and Iraq, if your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on return to the UK. 'Where there is a creditable likelihood of any British national travelling to high-risk area including Syria and Iraq, we will try to work with that person to ensure that they are fully aware of the risks, including highlighting the threat of kidnapping, and the effect of their travelling to fight could have on friends and family back in the UK. 'Our security advice is always in line with guidance given out by the Home Office in relation to foreign travel advice to high-risk areas.' Sir Edward Garnier QC, the former Solicitor General, warned last year that Britons who fight against terrorists in the Middle East would be interviewed by the police on their return. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are in a terrible grey area, not least because we don\u2019t know enough about what they are doing. 'The United Kingdom is trying to defeat Isil. But freelancers are not acting on behalf of the United Kingdom. They may well be guilty of murder, or other sorts of crimes, or they might not be guilty of anything. 'It goes to the general story who go abroad to fight in other people\u2019s wars place themselves not only in physical danger, but in that legal limbo land where they could, if they get on the wrong side of this almost invisible line, into trouble when they get home.'",

The Gloucester No 8 has not played since breaking his left leg during an Aviva Premiership game against Saracens in early January. But the signs suggest he is on course to play a part during England's World Cup warm-up period ahead of the tournament kicking off in mid-September. Ben Morgan is hopeful of featuring for England at the forthcoming World Cup despite his long-term injury . Morgan last featured for England when he scored two tries during their victory over Australia five months ago. Injury then struck, and he missed the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign as a result. The 26-year-old, though, remains an integral part of England boss Stuart Lancaster's World Cup plans, and the current prognosis is a good one after Morgan recently underwent final surgery to remove a pin from his leg. 'To be honest, I have not found this difficult at all,' said 27 times-capped Morgan, after watching his Gloucester colleagues continue their preparations for Friday night's European Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. 'I am really positive and using this as a great experience to make myself better for when I come back. Who else gets six months off to rest up and train hard? 'Yes, I will be at a disadvantage in terms of the fact I haven't played any rugby. 'But looking at the World Cup in particular, there will be lads who wouldn't have played for probably two and a bit months going into the first (warm-up) game, so everyone is going to be on an equal playing field. 'Things are going well at the moment. I am just trying to make sure I get back healthy when I come back. Gloucester No 8 Morgan broke his left leg playing against Saracens in the Aviva Premiership in January . 'I have a lot of strengthening to do around my legs - in the early stages you don't want to rush that. When things strengthen up, that's when I can start chucking some serious tin around. 'I had an operation last week. It is a case of seeing if things affect my ankle, and if they don't, then I can do them again. 'It is very reactive. I just have to take it day by day. It could be a couple of weeks down the line or a couple of months down the line when I run again, but there is no point rushing this sort of thing.' Lancaster is due to name a 45-man World Cup training squad next month, followed by his final 31-man group for the tournament in late August. England's World Cup preparations, meanwhile, also feature home and away games against France in August, plus a September appointment with reigning Six Nations champions Ireland at Twickenham. Morgan last played for England during his side's victory against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . Reflecting on the injury, Morgan added: 'It was tough, but it was one of those things. It happens - deal with it. 'If I start thinking about what I missed out on, I'm just going to become negative. I have this mindset going forward about living the law of attraction. 'It is basically positivity breeds positivity. If you get that positive mindset, you attract everything into your life that is positive. I'm thinking of this as a positive experience. 'I can get bigger, better, faster, stronger and improve myself as a player before I come back. I can use this to my advantage. Otherwise I could sit there and fester and get fat, lazy and never come back. 'I sat in the hospital and thought to myself 'okay, it's done. How long is it going to take me to get back?'' 'Ideally, I would like to be back playing in those warm-up games because that gives me a shot of getting in the squad. 'There are so many variables about what can happen, though. 'I might get a couple of months down the line and think that realistically I'm not going to get back, so think about next season instead. I have to look after myself. 'Yes, I desperately want to get back and put myself in contention, but I'm not going to do anything that is detrimental to my health. 'Right at this moment, I am in a great place.'",

Flight VS44 should have left  McCarran airport at 4.30pm local time on Easter Monday. But a series of delays meant the 403 passengers did not get away on their flight to Gatwick until early on Wednesday. The long delays were too much for some passengers who took to the airport floor to rest . A catalogue of events took place that saw passengers bound for London from Las Vegas delayed by over 33 hours . This shot was snapped by passenger Paul Glogiewicz; the passengers were eventually told there was a problem with the plane's rudder . And now, some passengers are considering legal action against Virgin. Jennifer Glogiewicz, who was travelling with husband Paul and celebrating her 40th birthday, told MailOnline Travel that they were shunted back and forth from the airport to the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel, only to find out each time that there were more delays. 'They just kept telling us the air con wasn't working and plane to warm to board. Then  later they said there was also a rudder issue,' said the mother of two from Bromley. 'The part needed was in the UK and that it would be flown in on tomorrow's inbound Vegas flight, then it would fitted and we would be flown home.' After being seated for two hours on the runway at the culmination of the 33-hour delays, the plane finally set off to the UK at 4am local time. 'We were very worried the entire flight hoping it had been fixed properly. 'Luckily it was a pleasant flight. Every announcement on board began with 'again we apologise'. 'We Landed at Gatwick and were given two letters and \u00a320 per person to spend in M&S; a bit late if you ask me. 'The main point of all our complaints was the lack of communication and awful customer skills of the Virgin Vegas ground staff. The lack of proper communication made the whole thing an absolute nightmare.' Unbelievably some passengers remained in good spirits despite being forced to an unscheduled check-in at the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel . Passenger Charlie Nolan captured this photo of the plane after repairs had been halted because of the winds . Another passenger, Charlie Nolan, claimed that a Virgin employee who was updating the passengers over the tannoy lost his cool when the 400 passengers sarcastically clapped and whooped at the news that the engineers had decided to move the plane to a sheltered area to repair. The wind at the airport had meant the repairs could not be carried out quickly . Nolan told MailOnline Travel that 'another Virgin employee at the gate almost broke down in tears over the tannoy and that 'she claimed she had been working for 48 hours and wanted to go home to her children.' Banker Michael Jazanovich, 30, from Crouch End, north London, who was returning from a stag do, told London's Evening Standard: 'It was an absolute nightmare for everyone involved. The delays were unacceptable and excruciating as they were pushed back and back and people had to sleep in the airport. 'We are expecting a lot more (than \u20ac600). We have lost our time and had an awful experience. 'We deserve a lot more and, by taking a group action, we can work together to get this. We could share a lawyer, we are willing to take it as far as we need to.' They were given hotel accommodation on Monday evening but spent Tuesday night in the airport terminal. Mrs Glogiewicz added: 'I do feel Virgin should just refund everyone their flight cost and be done, not make us all claim. 'This ending has tarnished a great time away with my husband and made me wary of future travel.' Passengers were taken to the Tropicana Las Vegas on numerous times during the long flight delay . Stranded passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations over the eventual 33-hour delay . Virgin has said that eligible passengers would be getting EU compensation of \u20ac600 (circa \u00a3434) plus out-of-pocket expenses, but some are demanding much more. A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said: 'We always try our best to get things right for our customers and we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by the delay of flight VS44 from Las Vegas to London Gatwick on April 6. 'On this occasion, the initial delay was caused by a technical fault with the aircraft and the delay was then extended because of strong winds around the McCarran airport area which hampered our engineers carrying out the repairs. Over 400 passengers endured a nightmare delay to their journey back to the UK from the US . The Virgin Atlantic flight eventually took flight some 33 hours behind schedule after technical problems (file photo) Passengers explained how they had been shipped back and forth to the airport with no solution . 'All of our customers were provided with hotel accommodation and meals while they waited, and we will reimburse them for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 'In addition, we will be providing eligible customers with EU compensation to the equivalent of \u20ac600 per person. 'Customers should visit www.virginatlantic.com/euclaimapplication for advice, details of the claims process and to download an application form. 'Once we\u2019ve received the completed claim form a dedicated customer relations team will issue payment as a priority.'",

Yesterday, as commemorations were held all over the world to mark the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, the Royal Family led tributes to those who fought and fell in the ill-fated offensive. The day began in London with a dawn ceremony at Wellington Arch on Hyde Park Corner, attended by Princess Anne. Later the Queen, joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince William and political leaders, led the nation during a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, while Prince Charles was in Turkey with Prince Harry.

The national flags of Australia, New Zealand, Turkey and the UK were carried through the Abbey and placed close to the high altar as a sign of reconciliation between old enemies. Earlier, Charles and Harry joined more than 10,000 people in a dawn pilgrimage at Gallipoli to honour the bravery of the Allied troops who stormed the peninsula's beaches in 1915. The landings were supposed to be a decisive blow that would knock the Turks out of the war. But eight months of bloody fighting later, after an estimated 145,000 lives on both sides had been lost, the Allies pulled out, having failed in their objective. Around 58,000 Allied troops were killed, many from Australia and New Zealand. Almost 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen are buried or commemorated on Gallipoli. Prince Charles gave a moving reading about troops weeping as they left their dead comrades behind when they left Gallipoli. He read the words of a soldier, who wrote: 'The hardest feature of the evacuation was in leaving those dead comrades behind. They had bequeathed us a sacred trust.'

Opening in 2018, the gigantic Terminal 1 will cover 700,000 square metres, and is set to handle 45million passengers a year. Renown British-Iraqi architect, Zaha Hadid, has collaborated with airport developers ADPI to create a six-tier concept which aims to decrease customer walking distances, and increase connectivity. Scroll down for video . Terminal 1 at\u00a0Beijing International Airport is set to the largest in the world, in order to cope with the surge in tourist numbers . Aiming to be the perfect welcome to Beijing, the designs focus on creating a feeling of space and openness, which is reflected in the flowing lines of the roof, and the lack of pillars inside. All the passenger pathways will convene in a central multi-layered courtyard, which will be a meeting place for passengers who have travelled from around the globe. Zaha Hadid's website states that the structure of Terminal 1 will guide users seamlessly and harmoniously through the building by public spaces that flow into each other, reflecting the harmony and balance between Chinese landscape and culture. It is hoped to combine the rich Chinese culture, with its impressive future on the worldwide stage. The huge terminal will focus on wide open spaces, made possible by the lack of pillars and flowing roof design . The international airport, which also goes by the name of Daxing Airport, is the second busiest in the world, after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport which saw 96 million passengers pass through it last year. London Heathrow was the third busiest in the world with over 73 million passengers. The new terminal reflects research by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch which found that there were 109 million Chinese tourists in 2014, who spent $164 billion. These figures are a dramatic increase from the 10 million outbound tourists in 2000. Opening in 2018, the gigantic Terminal 1 will cover 700,000 square metres, and is set to handle 45 million passengers a year .",

But talented Marcel Hirscher added a little extra flare to his downhill slalom run by bringing the pistes alive with a colourful display. The skier teamed up with The Red Bull Media House and Starelation to create the unusual stunt, using coloured powder packed into the poles he swerved around. Rainbow run! Marcel Hirscher performs during the project 'Marcel Hirscher Colours' at Reiteralm near Schladming . Blue eruption! The coloured powder was flung across the slopes as the talented skier went passed . 'It was a surreal experience \u2013 simply amazing!' said the four times World Champion skier, Marcel Hirscher . 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website' The process involved 11 cameras, a specially-enhanced slope, and three days to set up before creating the incredible video in one take with the 26-year-old Austrian. Marcel Hirscher slalomed in and out of poles filled to the brim with coloured, biodegradable powder, which erupted upon contact. Six GoPros, and a range of other cameras, including a hand held one by the skier captured the dazzling rainbow effect, which surrounded him at every turn. As the run required more ice than snow, a section of the Reiteralm slopes in Austria had to be watered, so that it could freeze over night in preparation. The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run in one take from a number of angles, before the ice melted. The most difficult part of the incredible video as filming it from all angles, without getting another cameraman in the shot. 'We wanted to bring a new, cool element into skiing,' Hirscher said on the Red Bull website, 'and create unforgettable images. And I think we succeeded!' 'It was a surreal experience \u2013 simply amazing! I couldn't ski with the speed I normally do in races, even though the course was very steep in the first part, up to 75 percent incline,' he explains. 'At each gate I was blinded for a split second because I had to ski through a cloud of yellow and blue.' The team had to get up at 4am to set up the cameras to capture the rainbow run from a number of angles, before the ice melted during the day . The biodegradable powder was placed in slalom poles along the course, and multiple cameras were set up to capture the effect from different angles . Rainbow powder!\u00a0After winning the overall World Cup title four years in a row, alpine skier Marcel Hirscher took a day off and had some fun at his local resort with his race skiis and some crazy colors, resulting in one of the most vibrant ski runs to date . Talented! This year the skier became the first men's skier ever to clinch a fourth straight World Cup overall title . Respect for the environment was a priority from the beginning of this project! The team has assured that the plants and wildlife have neither been damaged nor disturbed at any time during the project . Marcel's explosive slalom run is a Red Bull Media House production realised by Starelation . Record achievement! This year Hirscher became the first male alpine skier to win the overall World Cup title four times in a row . Respect for the environment was a priority from the beginning of this project! The team has assured that the plants and wildlife have neither been damaged nor disturbed at any time during the project . Now your usual slope! The team picked vibrant colours which would contrast heavily with the crisp white snow . The team wanted to get as close as they could to the skier but without any cameramen appearing in any shots . One chance! The team knew they had one attempt to get the shot, as once the powder had been released it would ruin any other shots . Born in Annaberg-Lung\u00f6tz, Salzburg, Hirscher made his World Cup debut in March 2007 . Marcel's father Ferdinand Hirscher said on his website: 'Marcel and I have been travelling to various races since his childhood. I contribute with my experience from this. I make sure that we \u2013 together with the coaches and the service crew \u2013 get to the maximum as a team.' The talented skier has 30 pairs of ski boots and 100 pairs of Atomic Redster racing skies prepared for use before every season . Impressive feat! The team took three days to prepare, shoot and edit the colourful video . Success!

The journalist who wrote Rolling Stone's flawed account of a campus rape is set to apologize Sunday night, when the Columbia Journalism School publishes a review of what went wrong with her reporting. Sabrina Rubin Erdely has been silent since December, when the magazine was forced to issue an apology in the wake of several factual errors highlighted in the piece about a University of Virginia student named Jackie. In the story, titled 'A Rape on Campus', Jackie claims to have been gang raped by seven men at campus fraternity Phi Kappa Psi two years ago. But a recent investigation by the Charlottesville Police found no evidence to support her story- including the fact that the man who brought her to the fraternity the night of the alleged incident doesn't seem to exist. The Columbia Graduate School of Journalism will release their review of the botched Rolling Stone investigation at 8pm on Sunday. Following that, sources tell CNN\u00a0that Erdely will release an apologetic statement and Rolling Stone will take the story down from their website. While the article initially sparked protests on campus, Erdely's reporting quickly began to fall apart as the Washington Post and  local outlets started following up on the allegations. One mistake of Erdely's previously highlighted, was the fact she agreed not to contact Jackie's alleged attackers. Scroll down for video . Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named \u00a0Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Three of Jackie's friends also denied Erdely's assertion that they discouraged the alleged victim from reporting the assault. By December 5, Rolling Stone acknowledged that there appeared 'to be discrepancies in Jackie's account.' The magazine asked for the independent review, which was conducted by the dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. The fraternity has called the article defamatory and said it was exploring its legal options. 'These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault,' said Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, after the Charlottesville police suspended their investigation. Despite its flaws, the article heightened scrutiny of campus sexual assaults amid a campaign by President Barack Obama. The University of Virginia had already been on the Department of Education's list of 55 colleges under investigation for their handling of sex assault violations. The article also prompted UVA President Teresa Sullivan to temporarily suspend Greek social events. Fraternities later agreed to ban kegs, hire security workers and keep at least three fraternity members sober at each event.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nTony Blair has been dragged into a bitter row in Mongolia over plans for gold mining in a region where the elaborate ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors are located. The former premier made an unannounced visit to Ulaanbataar last month in his capacity as a consultant to the cash-strapped government, which is dogged by allegations of endemic corruption. He met new Mongolian prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg but the secrecy surrounding his trip stoked fears from ecologists and the opposition that he is being deployed to encourage Western investment to the country to massively increase gold, copper and coal mining, despite acute environmental worries. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair with a Mongolian dignitary on his recent visit. The former British premier has been dragged into a row over gold mining plans which could destroy the ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors . A silver plate from the Noyon Uul burials, where some of the ancestors of Attila the Hun (right) are buried . An excavation at Noyon Uul. Ecologists fear a mining boom in the region could destroy sacred treasures . Specifically, there is concern over plans for development of the sacred pine-covered Noyon Uul region around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar which has \u00a31.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation, dating back to the first century BC. 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn, citing official sources. The news outlet - which claimed Blair had flown 'secretly' to Mongolia last week - also speculated he was advising on another controversial project, involving expansion of multinational Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert, and a possible bailout from the IMF. Atilla was a feared fifth century barbarian warrior who ruled the Hunnic Empire from the Urals to the Rhine. He was born in modern-day Hungary, but his fearsome forebears are seen as originating much further east, in Mongolia. Activists from ecological pressure groups including Save Noyon Uul have protested to the government that plans for a foreign mining company to exploit gold reserves 'will destroy the historical monuments of the Mongols and their ancestors. 'Driven to despair, they promised that if the Mongolian government allows mining in the sacred land of the Mongols, its defenders are ready to give their lives to save Noyon Uul', said one report last week. Mr Blair's visit to\u00a0Ulaanbataar was not noted on his website. His office said he makes regular Mongolia trips . Noyon Uul is around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar and has \u00a31.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation dating back to the first century BC . 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn . Silver decorations for a harness recovered from the burial site. It has up to 200 burial mounds . The Mongolian premier - who recruited Blair to Mongolia two years ago when he held the position of cabinet minister - is seen as the leading advocate of the plan to boost mining in several regions, including Noyon Uul, where Canadian company Centerra Gold may be given the go-ahead to exploit significant reserves. He lunched with the former Labour Party leader after he held a 'text message referendum', dismissed as a cheap gimmick by foes, aimed at garnering support for new mining to boost the flagging economy. The country's president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has 'a strong stance against mining of Noyen Uul and wants to leave the cultural heritage site intact', evidently contrary to the position of his prime minister, it was reported. There was no mention of the Mongolian trip on the official website of The Office of Tony Blair, nor any comment from the Ulaanbaatar government on whether his work includes advice on exploiting 50 tons of gold reserves. But Mongolia is under severe pressure to raise revenue from mining to head off an economic crisis after foreign investment slumped 74 per cent last year, with speculation also centering on Tavan Tolgoi, one of the world's largest untapped coal deposits in the South Gobi Desert. Tony Blair Associates one year ago hired Anand Pillai, formerly an adviser to Rio Tinto in Mongolia. Noted Russian scientist Natalia Polosmak - who has made sensational archeological discoveries at Noyon Uul - said: 'This was the burial ground of the Hun elite. Tony Blair takes part in discussions during his visit. He was recruited to work with Mongolia two years ago . Among the precious finds at the Noyon Uul site are these elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords . Unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold and carvings of fantastical creatures have also been found .

'The collection of fabrics that we found there is unique.' Among the precious finds were elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords, unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold, and carvings of fantastical creatures. A spokesperson from Mr Blair's office said: 'Tony Blair regularly visits Mongolia as part of his project there - which is already in the public domain - and has a full time team working on helping the government with its reform programme. 'He has nothing whatever to do with any gold mining business or other mining there so we don't know what is being referred to.' A spokesman for Centerra Gold, referring to the company's Gatsuurt mine in the\u00a0Noyon Uul region, said: 'Our Gatsuurt property has been designated as a deposit of strategic importance. 'We are continuing to work with the government to determine the level of Mongolian ownership in the project and before Gatsuurt can proceed. We need a deposit development agreement and the necessary permits, approvals and regulatory commissioning. 'We are aware of Mr Blair but not the details of his involvement with the government.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nDriving around in their mother's consular BMW in Miami to shoot up homes and steal hordes of marijuana: this was the indulgent life of two wealthy teenage sons of a Canadian diplomat. But the antics of 15-year-old Marc and 17-year-old Jean Wabafiyebazu were brought to a sudden halt on March 30 when a drugs raid went wrong and the older brother was shot dead. Marc is waiting to discover if he will be charged with his murder. Now, as the details of that night unfold, investigators are learning more about the gangster lifestyle they led - despite attending top private schools bankrolled by their mother Roxanne Dube, Canada's Consul General in Miami. Indulgent life: Jean Wabafiyebazu, 17, (left) and his 15-year-old brother Marc (right) drove around Canada raiding homes and buying drugs, the younger boy has told investigators . Bloody aftermath: The boys and a friend had driven to a house, pictured here with blood on the floor, to reportedly purchase two pounds of marijuana for $5,000. In the shooting, Jean was shot dead . The boys had recently moved to live with their mother in a gated community at the heart of the affluent Coral Way district. Court documents read by the National Post revealed Marc boasted to investigators that this raid was not their first. 'Defendant continued to state that he was from Canada and they had done the same type of thing in Canada and had also done other drug rip-offs in Miami,' the affidavit states. Indeed, Macleans reports that the pair would miss school to drive around with their loaded guns in the back seat. Marc and Jean, who both attended Ottawa's private Lycee Claudel school, were enrolled at different institutions when they got to the U.S.: Jean at $31,000-a-year Gulliver Preparatory School, Marc at the public Palmetto School. According to Macleans, both harbored a reputation for drug abuse - something the boys were already deeply immersed in. It has been widely reported that Jean had a substance abuse problem, tweeting about 'weed' and 'startin off the day wit mah blunt o herb'. Even his father told Global News he 'could tell' Jean was into drugs. But Marc, he insists, was the perfect child. Back story: Details are now emerging about the lifestyle of the boys, privately-educated sons of a Canadian diplomat. When they moved to Miami, Jean (left) was enrolled at a $31,000-a-year school . In court: Roxanne Dube, mother of the boys, is pictured arriving in court before her son's first hearing . High-ranking official: Dube, a one-time Fulbright scholar, was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. She was previously the envoy in Zimbabwe . However, in the wake of his brother's death, the younger brother defended their antics and proudly declared to investigators that they cavorted around Ottawa together. On the night of Jean's death they are said to have driven to a house to buy marijuana on Monday March 30 with their friend Jean met at a dance festival, 17-year-old Joshua White. As Marc sat in the car, Jean and Joshua went inside. Minutes later, they were dead and the alleged drug dealer inside, 19-year-old Anthony Rodriguez, was shot in the arm. A grand jury will decide whether to bring murder charges against Marc. Under Florida law, people can be charged with felony murder if they were involved in a crime that leads to a killing \u2014 even if a person didn't participate directly in the killing. Police also say Marc Wabafiyebazu threatened to shoot a detective in the head after his arrest, which would be another felony count. Assistant State Attorney Marie Mato said after a brief hearing that the grand jury could decide to charge 15-year-old Marc Wabafiyebazu as an adult. His attorney, Curt Obront, said Wabafiyebazu will plead not guilty to any charges that are filed. 'We will be defending these charges,' Obront told reporters. Dube attended the hearing Wednesday but did not speak with reporters. Marc Wabafiyebazu spoke only to answer a few questions from Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Angelica Zayas, who set an April 20 hearing on the results of the grand jury's work. 'How are you doing this morning?' Zayas asked the boy at one point. 'I'm doing fine,' he responded. 'Don't say anything to anybody about this case,' the judge warned. According to police reports, the Wabafiyebazu brothers \u2014 who had only recently relocated from their father's home in Ottawa, Canada, to South Florida to be with their mother \u2014 took their mother's personal vehicle to the alleged drug meeting. The personal vehicle carries diplomatic plates, but authorities say Marc Wabafiyebazu is not protected by diplomatic immunity. Crime scene: In this photo taken on Monday, March 30, 2015, Miami-Dade police detectives work at a crime scene in Miami, involving the two teenage sons of Roxanne Dube, Canada's counsel general in Maimi . Gunfire erupted soon after they entered, though Marc was in the car at the time . Police say Rodriguez brought the marijuana \u2014 worth less than $5,000 \u2014 and negotiations began. Marc Wabafiyebazu said he was waiting outside in his mother's car while his older brother went inside 'to conduct the rip-off,' according to a police report. 'In the process of that rip-off, several shots were fired inside the residence,' killing Jean Wabafiyebazu and Wright. Rodriguez was wounded along with a fourth person, 21-year-old Johan Ruiz, who was shot in the abdomen and is recovering. Police say Marc Wabafiyebazu rushed into the house after hearing the gunshots, but exactly what he did after that is not clear. Police have also said the two dead teenagers apparently shot each other. Authorities have not said where Jean Wabafiyebazu obtained a weapon or weapons they believe he brought to the residence. Anthony Rodriguez (above) was arrested on charges of felony murder and drug possession . Obront said Marc Wabafiyebazu has no prior criminal record. 'This is a tragic situation,' Obront said. 'Our heart goes out to all of the families.' Germano Wabafiyebazu said his sons borrowed their mother's personal car, which has diplomatic license plates, to drive to the house but told their mother they were just going for a drive. He said he was told that Marc rushed into the house after hearing a gunshot. Authorities say Marc will not be protected by diplomatic immunity. Dube and her family, meanwhile, expressed condolences to the family of Joshua Wright, the other deceased victim, and said they just want to be there for the younger son. 'Your grief is our grief,' she said. 'We can only hope that, in time, we will find common purpose towards diminishing the causes of such violent crimes. For now, we just want to be there for Marc, our incredibly caring son who loved his brother very much, and to say goodbye, ever so tenderly and quietly to Jean, our love.' Dube, a one-time Fulbright scholar, was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February. She was previously Canada's ambassador to Zimbabwe from 2005 to 2008 and also served as a staff member for a Canadian Liberal cabinet minister for more than a decade. John Babcock, a spokesman for Canada's foreign department, said Louise Leger has been named acting Head of Mission on an interim basis. The boys' father, Germano Wabafiyebazu,\u00a0said he and Dube were divorced a few years ago and that their son Jean struggled with substance abuse. He previously told Global News that he does not think Marc had anything to do with this tragedy, and that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life. 'My wife told me they didn't go out,' he said. 'They went to school, went home, went to school.'",

Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships . Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore. Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died .

'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away.

Summer, pictured as a youngster at school, left, and celebrating her birthday. Her family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to her . And while they are heartbroken over their daughter's death, her parents say they take great comfort from the fact that she died doing something she loved. Her mother said: 'It has motivated us to want to do something positive in her memory. 'We've decided to take a leaf out of Summer's book, and not take life so seriously. 'Now I don't mind so much if the phone doesn't work. There's more to life than worrying about work and paying the mortgage. 'That's only stuff, as Summer would say.' The family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to Miss Robertson. It came after \u00a31,500 was donated to the appeal through a collection at her funeral. It is hoped they can raise \u00a310,000, which would allow them to name a guide dog puppy after Miss Robertson.

This season, for the second time in three years, there were no English clubs in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, while none of our clubs have reached the last eight in the Europa League either. And with Italian and German clubs performing significantly better this season, England could slip from their current ranking of second to a lowly fourth by the end of next season. Chelsea look dejected as they exited the Champions League in the last 16 against PSG last month . Arsenal's Olivier Giroud punches the ground in frustration as his side suffered a defeat to Monaco . Germany will begin next season with a higher ranking than England, once 2010/11 points are discounted. If Juventus, Napoli and Fiorentina win all their remaining games possible, Italy will go into next season within 0.1 points of England. Even if Italian clubs fail to reach finals, a repeat of this season would see them overtake England in third place next season. Germany is guaranteed to move ahead of England at the end of this season, while if Italian clubs continue to perform well this season and English clubs fail to reverse their slump, the Premier League could end next season out of Europe's elite. That would see England reduced to three Champions League places for the 2017/18 season, with Serie A taking the extra place from the Premier League. UEFA's country coefficient rankings take into account the previous five seasons' performance by teams from each association, which means England are set to lose a huge chunk of their total at the start of next season. Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain celebrates as the Italians all but booked their place in the Europa League semis . Arsene Wenger cannot hide his disappointment as Arsenal were eliminated in the last 16 yet again . David Luiz celebrates scoring at Stamford Bridge as PSG knocked Chelsea out oEurope . The 2010/11 season saw Tottenham and Chelsea reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, while Manchester United lost in the final. Coupled with Liverpool and Manchester City reaching the last 16 of the Europa League, that earned England a massive 18.357 points, which will be knocked off the total at the start of next season. Italy and Germany will lose a significantly smaller number of points (11.571 and 15.666 respectively) meaning that by the beginning of next season, England will have slumped to third, and be in danger of falling further. Gianluigi Buffon celebrates as Juventus took a big step towards the last four by beating Monaco in Turin . Mohamed Salah runs at the Dynamo Kiev defence as they scored late to stay in with a chance of progress . The Premier League will still be defending a lead from Serie A going into the 2015/16 campaign, although how big that is remains to be seen. Each season every association gets points depending on how well their teams do. These are then divided by the number of teams that country provided for European competition. The previous five seasons make up a country's coefficient. How do the points work? Each team gets two points for a win and one point for a draw, with half-points for qualifiers. Teams get a bonus point for every round they reach in the knock-out stages of the Champions League, or every round after the quarter-finals of the Europa League. Qualifying for the Champions League group stages gets you a further four bonus points, as does reaching the last 16. With Juventus in pole position to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, Napoli all but into the last four of the Europa League, and Fiorentina in with a chance of joining them, Italy are likely to out-score England by at least four points this season, and that margin would grow if all three Italian clubs reach the final of their respective competitions. If all three teams were to win all of their remaining games - with the exception of an all-Italian Europa League final - Italy would pick up another five points for their coefficient, narrowing the gap to just 0.095 points. With Real Madrid and Barcelona still in the Champions League that may not be very likely, but any more Italian success will narrow the gap - and if the difference is less than four points, the English clubs will be nervously looking over their shoulders. A repeat next year would then certainly result in falling behind Serie A for the first time since 2006. And even if next season doesn't see England slump to fourth, without a significant reversal in the fortunes of Premier League and Serie A clubs in the next two years, the season afterwards would see England in major trouble. So if the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool think fighting over the top four is a struggle, they need to start winning in Europe - or it could be down to a top three. England are set to lose their points from the 2010/11 season, when Tottenham reached the quarter finals .",

This after authorities searched the residences following an incident on Saturday night in which Brennan accidentally blew up his car while smoking a cigarette and police discovered 'various bomb-making components.' Scroll down for video . Joseph T. Brennan Jr. (above) of Norwell, Massachusetts was found with a home full of bomb-making materials . Police searched the home after an incident Saturday night where Brennan blew up his car (above) while smoking a cigarette near gun powder . 'I\u2019m an idiot. I lit a cigarette with the gunpowder in the front seat,' Brennan said in the police report according to the Boston Herald. The blast left the man with minor injuries and he was admitted to\u00a0Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. Brennan, with singed eyebrows and bandaged hands, said he did not want to be on \"TV\" as he was being arraigned Monday afternoon, trying to hide his face and singed eyebrows with a towel. In addition to Brennan's home in Norwell, the condo of Benjamin Young in Hingham was also found to be full of bomb-making devices. Police have not revealed at this time the relationship between the two men. Hazardous materials team responded to both locations and were able to remove and safely detonate some of the materials. Authorities do not believe the two men had any ties to terrorism. Brennan, who called himself an 'idiot' after blowing up his car, was arraigned from his hospital bed on Monday . Police searched the car Saturday night and seized 14 different substances .

He wrote; 'When people say it's not rocket science I get disappointed here's a variation of solid rocket propellant used in the retired space shuttles solid rocket boosters I think I'm in the wrong profession.' A witness to Saturday's car accident told police they heard a loud explosion and saw Brennan laying on the road as his car rolled towards a guardrail. Brennan then got up and gathered some materials and put them in his trunk according to the witness.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)She could stand on a strand of human hair, with room to spare. The microscopic polymer statue by South African sculptor Jonty Hurwitz, entitled Trust, measured just 1/100th of a centimeter and had been called the \"smallest sculpture ever made.\" But the world's tiniest woman suddenly disappeared to an unknown location, likely never to be seen again. While she was being photographed through an electron microscope -- the only way to view the minute creation -- Trust vanished, with only a smudged fingerprint left behind by her photographer as a clue. After an hour long search, Hurwitz and the photographer gave in: \"It was horror. I remember saying to him: 'You just destroyed or lost the smallest human form that was ever created in history,' said Hurwitz to CNN Ones to Watch. \"It was gone.\" But was it, really? Hurwitz is an entrepreneur-turned-artist who has applied the same tech wizardry to sculpture that he put into coding a finance site valued at over $500 million. The 45-year-old's \"Nano-sculptures\" are made from a mysterious resin -- \"a big scientific secret\", says Hurwitz -- and created through a process called \"two-photon lithography.\" Hurwitz works with a team of nanotechnology engineers at Karlsruhe University, who focus beams of ultraviolet light to \"zap\" solid the liquid resin, one 3D pixel at a time. The resulting sculptures -- he has also created a statue depicting the classical myth of Cupid and Psyche -- can lie on an ant's head. Put one into the eye of a needle, and it will barely occupy one corner. The \"Nano\" project is just one of Hurwitz' science-inspired sculptural experiments. Another one explores the properties of the mathematical constant Pi, presenting an indecipherable, \"anamorphic\" physical sculpture, whose hidden form becomes clear only when reflected in a cylindrical mirror. And he hints that a forthcoming project will also be influenced by his love of the natural world, but will sit at the opposite end of the scale to his nano-models. Hurwitz, who first made his name as the UK-based co-founder of controversial \"payday\" loans business Wonga, says he makes visual art with a team, as in traditionally collaborative art forms, such as cinema. He discusses accumulating collaborators as an aggressive start-up accumulates new talent: . \"I spent a huge amount of time scouring the world for amazing achievements of humanity and contact these people to work with them. For me the creation of an artwork these days is analogous to the creation of a film: for each piece there may 20 people involved, each one brilliant in their field.\" Hurwitz makes no secret of his desire to bring together contemporary science and art -- delighting in the fact that his nano-scale and 3D printed pieces depend on cutting edge technology, and would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago. Online, fans response has been overwhelming, he says, and the internet has become his exhibition space. It provides an \"epic scale\" that brick-and-mortar galleries can't match, he says, and estimates 13 million people have seen his sculptures since they hit the web in November last year. \"I love the buzz. I love the buzz when I launch a piece on the Internet and on Google Analytics, you suddenly see society engaging... millions and millions of people engaging.\" \"You put a few images on the internet and just watch society consume, engage and think. With comments and blogs and people saying 'It's not art' and people working out the science behind it and people complaining... I just love that buzz! I love influencing society.\" There's also another side -- what Hurwitz calls \"the traditional side of the geeky art world\" -- accusing him of being just an engineer rather than an artist. But he's unapologetic: . \"A lot of the artistic expression that I bring to the world represents the absolute current moment in human development. Whether it's 3D printing, technology or science, I love to represent the now.\" Hurwitz says the creation of the physical artwork is \"just the beginning of its lifecycle.\" So what about the missing woman, whose lifecycle has tragically been cut short? She came back to life during the filming of CNN Ones to Watch (in the video above) -- Trust v.2, her new name, has taken the absent dancer's place. Even still, there are some who think neither dancer was ever there. Invisible to the naked eye, how can we trust this sculpture ever existed beyond the computer screen? For Hurwitz, this mystery gets right to the heart of nano-scale's appeal: . \"You've got this 'emperor's new clothes' element to this end of the scale spectrum, because you look at these nano-sculptures and there's nothing there, there's an element of me going: 'this sculpture... believe me, it's there.' \"At that scale, the sculpture doesn't really exist, or our perception doesn't allow us to perceive its existence. \"In a way, it challenges the whole idea of contemporary art, by asking: 'Hang on, a piece of art you can't really see, is it really a piece of art?'\"",

Kim disbanded the group of hand-picked teenagers shortly after the death of his father in the North Korean capital Pyongyang in December 2011. But now that the country's official three-year mourning period for Kim Jong-il has concluded, the eccentric autocrat has demanded his advisers find suitable new women for the role, as the previous members retired  and were married off to military generals\u00a0when they hit their early 20s.

Happily married:\u00a0Kim Jong-un is photographed with his wife Ri Sol-ju in Pyongyang in July 2012 . News that\u00a0Kim Jong-un is re-establishing the so-called 'pleasure troupe' was reported by South Korea's Chosun Ilbo. The tradition was established by the dictator's grandfather Kim Il-sung - who is considered the founder of North Korea and still holds the title of Eternal President despite dying in 1994. North Korean officials have traditionally scoured the countryside for pretty teenagers, sometimes as young as 13-years-old, who are then taken to Pyongyang to work as dancers, singers or servants for the country's leaders. Often the most attractive girls are forcibly married off to powerful military generals as a way of rewarding the men for their all-important loyalty to the regime. As part of the handover of power following the death of\u00a0Kim Il-sung in 2011, the entire troop was dismantled and sent off to marry members of the North Korean establishment. But now that three years have passed it is thought acceptable for Kim to restart the tradition by finding his own girls. Inspection: Kim Jong-un is photographed at a machine plant yesterday in images released by state media . Giving orders:\u00a0Kim Jong-Un inspects a machine plant at an undisclosed location in North Korea yesterday . Kim Il-sung's personal 'pleasure troupe' were given\u00a0$4,000 pay-offs upon his death as a reward for their service to the regime, according to the Telegraph. As teenagers most were simply taken out of school and moved from their hometowns without the consent of their parents, who were no doubt terrified at what could happen to them if they resisted. The girls reportedly lived in the senior officials' houses and were traditionally allowed to marry their employers and 'retire' from service by the time they reached their early 20s. The three-year absence of the 'pleasure troupe' was due to a complete overhaul of the North Korean establishment by Kim Jong-un following his father's death. The dictator moved swiftly to remove the most powerful figures from his father's regime - having many of them executed - and replaced them with his own group of spineless bureaucrats.",

UK passengers faced more holiday chaos than during the same period last year, according to analysis from flight data specialist EUclaim. In the first four months of the year, there have so far been 5,080 flight cancellations, compared to the 4,239 cancellations during the same period in 2014. According to flight data specialist EUclaim, cancellations and delays are on the rise so far this year over last . The number of delays also increased to 2,427 from 2,260 in 2014. It's low-cost carrier Monarch that has seen the greatest increase in delays so far, with passengers suffering 64 incidents compared to 47 during the same period of time last year. That's an increase of 30 per cent. And EasyJet hasn't fared much better, experiencing a 19 per cent increase in delays. During last year's first quarter, there were a reported 206 hold-ups, while this year has already seen 245. However, airlines are refuting the figures. A spokesperson fro Monarch said: 'The recent media report in regards to the on time performance during the first quarter of this year is incorrect and misleading. 'For clarity, during the first quarter of 2015 we experienced winter weather across Europe which has been far worse than the same period last year, which particularly affected our operation to and from France, as well as the recent the French ATC strike which affected many carriers across Europe. It should be noted that during this time frame Monarch Airlines\u2019 did not cancel any flights. 'In the event of strikes or weather disruption, the business model of many other airline carriers is to cancel services; which will protect their on-time performance, but of course have a negative impact on their customers. 'Monarch Airlines will only cancel flights if there is absolutely no viable way of operating that flight thus placing the highest value on getting customers to their destination as opposed to protecting our on-time performance by tactically cancelling our flights.' Low-cost carrier Monarch has fared the worst so far in 2015, experiencing a 30% increase in delays . Despite all the hold ups, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced its delays by 37% . But it may not be entirely the fault of the airlines. Monarch - 39% increase . EasyJet - 19% increase . Jet2 - 17% increase . Virgin - 7% increase . Thomson - 6% increase . Ryanair - 6% increase . British Airways - 11% decrease . Thomas Cook - 37% decrease . Winter weather across Europe this year has been far worse than the same period last year and has particularly affected Jet2, easyJet and Monarch's routes to Chambery and Grenoble in France. Similarly, delays and cancellations could also be attributed to a number of strikes on the continent. The four-day Lufthansa strike in March resulted in some 116 cancellations of flights to the UK. Strikes by Italian Air Traffic Controllers and security staff in Germany also compounded such a problem. Still, despite the external factors, it's been a good year for Thomas Cook, which has reduced delays by 37 per cent, and British Airways also saw an 11 per cent reduction in stoppages. Monarch Airlines contests the EUclaim figures, however, telling MailOnline Travel that 'their source of information is questionable. 'They claim that their data comes directly from the aircrafts on board ACARS and ADS-B systems, but Monarch Airlines use neither of these. 'The reason that our OTP figures appear higher than other airlines is due to the fact that we have not cancelled any flights. 'We put our customers before our OTP and would rather operate with a delay than not at all.'",

Right in the ear: Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Chinese Grand Prix by spraying the hostess in the face with champagne . Not impressed: The hostess looks less than impressed as she is sprayed with champagne on the podium in Shanghai on Sunday . Trademark move: It's not the first time the racing ace has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . Caught by surprise: The hostess's colleagues laugh in the background as she gets a soaking from the champion British racing driver . Drenched: Hamilton\u00a0controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship . Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object, a campaign on media sexism and 'sex object culture', said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future.\u00a0For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'.\u00a0Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and\u00a0the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. Sprayed: He's made it a signature move, here Hamilton sprays a hostess at Montmelo at the Spanish Grand Prix\u00a0at Circuit de Catalunya . But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday. But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference. His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that \u2018Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.\u2019 Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' Soaked: It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference . Smiles: The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning the Chinese Formula One on Sunday . A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.

Interviewer Diane Sawyer looked shocked when he made the revelation on her ABC 20/20 special last night. Jenner said 'I've always been on the more conservative side' when he was asked about LGBT issues - and replied 'yes' when asked if he was a Republican. Sawyer had mentioned President's decision to identify trans citizens in his most recent State of The Union address. Jenner said:\u00a0\u201cHe actually was the first one to say the actual word transgender, I will certainly give him credit for that.' 'But not to get political, I\u2019ve just never been a big fan \u2014 I\u2019m kind of more on the conservative side.' Scroll down for video . Republican: Bruce Jenner told Diane Sawyer he is a Republican as he announced his transition to a woman on Friday night . Jenner added that neither the Republicans nor Democrats had a 'monopoly on understanding' and said he would lobby the GOP over LGBT rights. 'I would do that, yeah, in a heartbeat,' he said. He also said in the interview that he still considers himself a heterosexual, discussed his faith and said he was a Christian. 'I would sit in church and always wonder, \"In God\u2019s eyes, how does he see me?\"' he said. 'Maybe this is my cause in life.' His remarks came in the Friday night interview in which Jenner  revealed that he identifies as a woman - his 'true self' and a childhood dream - in an explosive ABC interview with Diane Sawyer. The 65-year-old Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star sparked rumors about his gender identity last year after visibly altering his appearance. And last night, he confirmed that he is reinventing himself physically in a bid to transition from male to female in the highly-anticipated, intimate sit-down. Speaking in front of millions of viewers, including Kim Kardashian and her family, Bruce tearfully revealed: 'For all intents and purposes, I am a woman. Christian: Jenner also said that he is a Christian and wondered whether transitioning to a woman was his cause in life . 'My brain is much more female than it is male. That's what my soul is. Bruce lives a lie. She is not a lie.' He firmly added: 'I can't do it anymore.' During the interview, Bruce also admitted that he has been regularly taking female hormones - and plans to completely transform into a woman. But he said he was still attracted to females. 'I was never attracted to the guys,' he told Diane, explaining how he has always enjoyed a good sex life. And he denied that his revelations were for publicity purposes. Instead, he made them due to his inability to continue to 'pull the curtain', he said. Indeed, hiding his identity was so painful for Bruce that it once left him contemplating suicide to escape from the never-ending scrutiny, he revealed. Many viewers and celebrities were taking to social media last night to congratulate Bruce on making a giant leap for the transgender community. Lady Gaga tweeted: '#BruceJennerABC Now that is bravery', before telling her fans to 'empower people like Bruce' globally by 'being loving & not mean'. Meanwhile, Bruce's 17-year-old daughter, Kylie Jenner, tweeted an emotional message to her father. 'Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave. My beautiful Hero,' she wrote.",

One-year-old Anna and six-year-old Indi have been thrilling crowds at surfing competitions for dogs after taking to the sport like a duck to water. With the help of their owner, Zane Jones, the four-legged surfers use their low centre of gravity to keep them stable while hanging ten off the coast of Queensland, Australia.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)The best part of the Supreme Court oral arguments about marriage equality was when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alluded to S&M. OK, she didn't actually mention S&M, but Ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago, when it was \"a dominant and a subordinate relationship.\" \"Yes, it was marriage between a man and a woman, but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled,\" said Ginsburg.  \"It was her obligation to follow him.\" Mary Bonauto, the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the Supreme Court, said in response:  \"That's correct. ... For centuries we had and Europe had this coverture system where a woman's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles.  And again, because of equality and changing social circumstances, all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated.\" Once upon a time, wives were the legal property of their husbands and \"marital rape\" was not only not a crime but not even a concept.  To argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully na\u00efve. Justice Anthony Kennedy, widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines, at one point referred to \"the nobility and the sacredness of marriage.\" Which is true, if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present.  If anything, the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people.  One downside to arguing that marriage has \"always been\" between a man and a woman is that, therefore, any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples, too. The one justice who didn't ask a question is Clarence Thomas, who, with one slight exception, has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench.  It should be carefully noted here that Thomas is a black man married to a white woman.  Anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in Maryland.  That means that by 1967, when the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of such laws, bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the American \"definition\" of marriage for over 300 years.  Just 20 years after the Supreme Court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states, Clarence Thomas and his wife, Virginia, were married. James Braxton Peterson, director of Africana Studies at Lehigh University, has written, \"The fact that the Thomas' marriage required progressive Supreme Court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment.\"  Or maybe not.  Clarence Thomas didn't say one way or the other, though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he's firmly opposed to the Supreme Court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own. But perhaps the example of Clarence Thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases, namely that just as with the rest of America, the Supreme Court seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics. Perhaps this was always the case, justices hiding their personal beliefs behind legal rationales. Still, the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law.  On the one hand, pulling pages right from Republican presidential candidates, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts suggested the court shouldn't intervene in a state-driven social debate.  Aping conservative religious activists, Justice Samuel Alito asked whether four people could then get married. On the other hand, Justice Stephen Breyer talked about marriage as a fundamental liberty while Justice Elena Kagan pushed back on whether legalizing same-sex marriage would really harm or take anything away from opposite-sex couples.  Both arguments, and the moral force beneath them, seemed to echo gay rights messaging. Still, the highly political and momentous decision in Loving vs. Virginia was unanimous.  Whichever way the court rules on same-sex marriage, it appears unlikely the ruling will be unanimous. So, while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved, a fact hopefully the Supreme Court will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality, what's also clear is that the court has evolved. Blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up America in general, the Supreme Court is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics. The question remains not what is fundamentally the right decision \u2014 I think both law and morality are clear in favor of equal treatment.  The question is simply which side of the court will dominate the other.",

The London Mayor, who appeared alongside Mr Miliband on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match. But Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, ended up laughing off the attack, responding: 'Come on Boris, you're better than that.' Animated: Boris Johnson wags a finger at Miliband, who appears to have a clenched fist, on the Andrew Marr Show this morning. The rivals' encounter quickly descended into a slanging match . No let-up: The Tory and Labour politicians go at it hammer and tongs in front of their TV audience . The heated exchange ends with presenter Andrew Marr (right) injecting and the men trying to laugh about it . Mr Johnson's verbal mauling of the Labour leader comes after the Tories were accused of 'descending into the gutter' for claiming that Mr Miliband may 'stab the country in the back' by doing a deal with the SNP to get into power. But today, Mr Johnson insisted that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP, and claimed the prospect was 'actually deeply alarming'. He said Mr Miliband would have to take help from the Scottish party 'crouching on his back like a monkey' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole UK. The London Mayor added: I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back... [but] he [Ed Miliband] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother, and that is the key point.' Verbal onslaught: Mr Johnson said that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP . Time to go: Mr Johnson and Mr Miliband leave the politics programme after their massive on-air argument . Mr Miliband arrived at the BBC studios in Central London by car, while Mr Johnson cycled there . Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership in September 2010 by narrowly beating his brother David, who had been the runaway favourite for the top job. The younger sibling won the ballot by just over 1 per cent after the second, third and fourth preference votes came into play. David had garnered the majority of support from Labour MPs and party members - but Ed was ahead with the trade-union members. He hugged David after the result was announced - but later admitted the decision to stand against him caused deep division between the brothers. David stayed on as an MP until 2013, then announced he was quitting Parliament to become head of the giant New York-based charity International Rescue Committee. Mr Miliband hit out at the Conservatives for their campaign, saying: 'They are so desperate they are reduced to trying to set one part of the country against another.' Mr Johnson insisted the Conservative attacks on the SNP were not risking the union. 'I'm so proud and so positive about what's happening in this country at the moment, and I just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this Labour-SNP condominium,' he said. 'So the answer would be, no I don't think we are in any way imperiling the union. The people who would imperil the union, because that's what their party is called, is the Scottish Nationalist Party. 'And I imagine their strategy - like the parable, or the fable, of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting... [he is cut off]' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly insisted that he will not make any 'deals' with the SNP to become Prime Minister. And he told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' Asked explicitly whether he was ruling out a confidence-and-supply agreement, he replied: 'No deals.' Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson livened up the election campaign this morning when they went head-to-head on live TV. After being interviewed separately by presenter Andrew Marr, the pair of would-be Prime Ministers were brought together to challenge each other directly. Mr Miliband kicked off the heated exchange by demanding to know if Mr Johnson backed rules that allow wealthy foreigners living in Britain to avoid tax on their overseas earnings. He said: \u2018Are you for keeping non-dom status? You\u2019re defending those people who come here, they live here for 30 years, they are permanently here and they don\u2019t pay taxes here.\u2019 Mr Johnson responded: \u2018Hang on, is this the Ed Miliband who was in the Treasury with Gordon Brown for about ten years? Are you the same creature? I mean, is there some sort of doppelganger going on?\u2019 The Labour leader hit back, saying: \u2018Don\u2019t get rattled, come on now. Andrew Marr interjected to ask the London Mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused Mr Miliband of being a back stabber. He said: \u2018You attacked Ed Miliband very forcibly today, Boris, for backstabbing. Do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election? Before Mr Johnson could speak, Mr Miliband said: \u2018He doesn\u2019t believe it. Come on, Boris, you are better than that.\u2019 But the London Mayor replied: \u2018I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back.\u00a0But he would do more damage to this country than to his brother - and that is the key point.\u2019",

Late goals from Robert Huth and Jamie Vardy sealed a dramatic 3-2 victory against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, a week after Andy King's late goal secured a 2-1 win against West Ham United. The Foxes had look buried two weeks ago, seven points adrift of the relative safety of 17th place, but are now just three points behind Hull City, the side immediately above the relegation trapdoor. Jamie Vardy scored an late winner against West Brom on Saturday to improve Leicester's chances of survival . Vardy struck past West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill during the closing stages of the game at The Hawthorns . Robert Huth nodded home with 10 minutes left on the clock to help his side launch an emphatic comeback . Foxes boss Nigel Pearson (left) believes Premier League survival is still firmly placed in his side's hands . Crucially Leicester, who have discovered an attacking potency with eight goals in three games, have a game in hand over their survival rivals and play five of their final seven fixtures at home. 'One thing we've spoken about recently is we want to keep (our fate) in our own hands for as long as possible,' Pearson told the BBC. 'While it's in our own hands you know that the responsibility is solely with ourselves. In many ways that's the driving force for us but we've still got an awful lot to do. 'It's more congested (at the bottom of the table) but because of the gap there has been for such a long time we don't have any chances of getting away with a disappointing result. Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso opened the scoring against West Ham with a spectacular effort last Saturday . However the Foxes were instantly punished when West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate netted immediately . But Andy King (left) was the hero as the Premier League strugglers struck late on at the King Power Stadium . 'We've got to try and force the issue between now and the end of the season.' Leicester have been rooted to the foot of the table since November but are slowly building much-needed momentum as the battle to avoid the drop intensifies. 'I hope (we've got momentum). Back-to-back wins are difficult to achieve, especially for a side like ourselves who have been struggling for vast parts of the season in terms of results,' he said. 'It's going to be tough but we'll give it a good shot.' Leicester have a relatively manageable run-in and play host to Swansea City in their next game on Saturday.",

The 43-year-old entrepreneur bought the three-bedroom property in the Park Circus area of Glasgow for \u00a3780,700 after she split from her former husband Michael in December 2011. She spent months renovating the period two-storey townhouse, described by estate agents as an 'outstanding interior designed luxury home' \u00a0which has been 'impeccably refurbished'. Scroll down for video . On the market: Michelle Mone has put her luxury Glasgow townhouse up for sale so she can buy her husband out of their 'dream' mansion . Luxury: The \u00a31million property in the exclusive area of the city comes complete with ornate high ceilings and large windows in the living room . Trendy: The fully-integrated kitchen has been fitted with modern, top of the range appliances and features a white gloss central island . Tycoon: Michelle Mone set up Ultimo underwear business with her husband Michael (right) in 1996, but they split in December 2011 . It features a grand staircase and magnificent reception hall leading to a modern fully integrated kitchen and drawing room complete with a marble fireplace and a living flame fire. The views expand over the residents central gardens in the exclusive part of the city and the master suite comes with it's own wet room. Each of the three high-ceilings bedrooms have been kitted out with lavish headboards, sparkling chandeliers and luxurious curtains. Interior photographs show the living room with a baby grand piano in it and a painting of a sleeping blonde woman above the fireplace. Grand: Ms Mone didn't move into the townhouse straightaway after spending months having it renovated, including this spectacular staircase . Magnificent: The large hallway leads to the staircase in the two-storey property, which comes complete with three bedrooms . Impressive: Ms Mone bought the property for \u00a3780,000 after splitting from her then husband. The large hallway comes with a massive mirror . It is being marketed by estate agents Corum for offers over \u00a3875,000, which means the Ultimo founder will profit from at least \u00a3100,00 if it sells. Once the sale is completed she plans to move back into her family home, a five-bedroom mansion in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire, after agreeing a deal with her ex-husband to buy it . Mone, who also owns a \u00a32million flat in Mayfair, London, said she would change her old mansion to rid it of 'bad memories' when she revealed her property plans last week. The mother-of-three said: 'I'm selling my home here in Glasgow but I also own the big house with my ex-husband. For two years I've been trying to buy him out of it and he only agreed just the other day - which is fantastic. 'I'm over the moon. I'll always have a base here in Glasgow but I've moved in to my London home as well. So, that means I'll have just the one home here rather than one and a half.' She said that although she has not lived in the Thorntonhall home for two years, she 'loves' the property, which she bought with her then husband, Mr Mone, in 2008. They demolished the original building, and built 'Telperion', a home six times the size of the average British house. Comfy: The bay windows stream light into the living room of the property, in an exclusive area of Glasgow, which has been fully re-decorated . Elegant: One of the bedrooms in the property has been decorated with a cerise and beige velvet accessories and features a large window seat . Sparkling: The master suite includes a wet room, kitted out in a gold-theme, while the house also has another shower room and laundry room . 'I designed it, I built it, I love it,' she said. 'But I'm going to change it all so that it doesn't have any of the bad memories from when I lived there. That said, I haven't been spending a whole lot of time in the town house since I've been promoting my book in America.' In 2010, Ms Mone was at the centre of a row with neighbours over plans to add a sauna, gym and bar to the home. Five residents objected to her proposals and one said the development would 'completely dwarf' the rest of the street. But it was still given the go-ahead by planners. The couple created lingerie brand Ultimo together in 1996, split in 2011 after she believed Michael had had an affair with bra designer, Samantha Bunn, with whom he has set up a rival lingerie firm. Writing on Twitter earlier this month, Ms Mone said: 'Sad to be selling my stunning townhouse in Scotland. Brilliant news is after trying for two years I'm buying my ex out of my dream home.' The couple continued to live in the family home for some time after their acrimonious separation. In her recently published autobiography, Mone admitted she put laxatives in her husband's coffee, let down his tyres and cut holes in his boxer shorts. She also said that on one occasion while they were still sharing the marital home, she poured cold water on his side of the bed. Ms Mone said later: 'I am sorry for that. Sorry for that woman I became. It wasn't nice at all.' After she moved into the townhouse in Park Circus, she opened the doors of the home for a photoshoot with Hello! magazine, describing the property as her 'new beginning'.

But it seems the message hasn't got through to the majority of us. Research has revealed that three out of four people have little or no knowledge about the Battle of Waterloo. Only just over half (53 per cent) know the Duke of Wellington led the British forces, while one in seven believe that it was the French who were victorious in 1815. Veeker's rendering of the battle between\u00a0Wellington's Anglo-Dutch army and the French:\u00a0Forty-seven per cent of 2,070 adults polled said they didn't know who led British forces against France in the battle . The survey, by the National Army Museum ahead of the 200th anniversary on June 18, also showed that young people are more likely to associate Waterloo with the London railway station or the Abba song than the actual battle \u2013 with one in eight of those aged 18-24 saying they'd never heard of it. Forty-seven per cent of 2,070 adults polled said they didn't know, or they thought the man in charge was either Sir Francis Drake, Sir Winston Churchill, King Arthur or even Harry Potter's wizardry mentor Albus Dumbledore. More than a quarter of all the people polled (28 per cent) have no idea who won the Battle of Waterloo, while one in seven (14 per cent) wrongly believe the French were victorious over the British. Two-thirds (67 per cent) are unaware that June 18th this year is the bicentenary of Waterloo. Now the National Army Museum, together with Waterloo 200 - the organisation approved by the government to support the anniversary - and other cultural organisations, are planning a series of events to bring Waterloo to life . Janice Murray, Director-General at the National Army Museum, said: 'Despite the Battle of Waterloo being an iconic moment in British history, UK public awareness is dramatically low. 'The National Army Museum is seeking to bridge this knowledge gap through the creation of a series of innovative pop-up events and regional exhibitions around the country making the dramatic story of the battle accessible for all.' Abba at the 1974 Eurovision song contest: Young people are more likely to associate Waterloo the Abba song than the actual battle . Young people were also likely to associate the battle with the London Station,\u00a0with one in eight of those aged 18-24 saying they'd never heard of the battle . The Battle of Waterloo took place on June 18th, 1815, when British and Prussian forces, under the command of Duke of Wellington, halted the advance of French Army in Belgium. The bloody battle claimed the lives of 65,000 of the 200,000 men that took part, and saw the defeat of Napoleon, ending his reign as Emperor of France and ushering in a period of peace following years of war in Europe. The National Army Museum, based in Chelsea, west London, is currently closed for redevelopment. It is due to reopen next year .",

But he is reluctant to leave. Most of the rest of his party have gone but he lingers as the final minutes are played out, with the score 0-0. It has been a frustrating night for Salford City, the club Scholes co-owns with former Manchester United team-mates Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. A draw here at Prescot Cables means automatic promotion will become only an outside possibility. Gary Neville and Paul Scholes attending the Salford City game at home to Clitheroe Town on Saturday . (Left to right) Scholes, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs co-own the club with Gary Neville (not pictured) Salford are attacking the far end of the ground and the view is obscured but, with 90 seconds remaining, the ball breaks for substitute Gareth Seddon about 10 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. And even from Scholes\u2019s long-distance view the ripple of net is immediately visible as the ball beats the keeper and Seddon turns away to celebrate. Scholes, too, punches the air, his face beaming as it once did when he scored a last-minute goal against Manchester City in April 2010. \u2018We had to win,\u2019 he says, a look of real relief in his eyes. This must compare to watching United in a title run-in. \u2018It\u2019s the same,\u2019 he replies nonplussed, before reconsidering. \u2018Tonight it has been worse.\u2019 Seddon\u2019s late goal set the wheels in motion for a fantastic run that has seen Salford win six on the bounce, their latest victory away at Burscough on Saturday. It takes them five points clear of Darlington, who have a game in hand, at the top of the Evo-Stik League First Division North (four tiers below the Football League). With one week to go promotion is well and truly in their hands. Win at home to Ossett Town on Saturday and they are up. Remarkably, Salford City are the team who have happened upon five of the biggest names in English football as owners. The former United players, otherwise known as the Class of \u201992, are products of the Premier League era which has propelled the game into a celebrity culture. Here, though, they seem in their element and none more so than Scholes. Earlier Phil Neville was with him. \u2018This is going to ruin my week, this is,\u2019 he mutters as another chance is wasted. This is near the base of the football pyramid: clearly the players are a lot better than Sunday League footballers but the culture is closer to Hackney Marshes than Old Trafford. Scholes sits in one corner with a friend, while Phil Neville, across the table with his father, Neville, informs him that they will be pairing up with One Direction at a forthcoming Pro-Am Golf Day so Scholes might need a stylist to keep up appearances. Scholes pulls a face while the rest of the group laughs at his expense. Meanwhile, the Prescot committee members quietly discuss a promising first half. The Salford owners are scarcely given a second glance, though there is the occasional photo to pose for. A queue of fans wait for food duing the Evo-Stick League Northern Premier match . Jimmy Birtwhistle, pictured with his grandsons, is a committee member and has looked after the turnstile for the past six years . Although yesterday\u2019s 2-1 win at Burscough extended Salford\u2019s lead at the top, the season has been anything but a smooth ride. The original manager Phil Power was sacked in January and left complaining that the decision was delivered by chairman Karen Baird, with the owners failing to contact him. Both Gary and Phil Neville say they did contact him to talk through their reasons but the offer was refused. \u2018That was a low moment and not something we want to do often because there are good people at this level and you don\u2019t want them to lose their job,\u2019 said Phil Neville. \u2018This season has been a massive learning curve. The biggest lesson we have learnt is we have to take a step away from the playing and coaching side. Let the managers manage and players play. At this level, they are the experts, not us.\u2019 The club are now managed by the duo of Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley, who won promotion from this league last season with Ramsbottom United. When Power was in charge, Scholes and Phil Neville attended training and helped out with sessions but, under the new managers, that has come to an end. \u2018We had become the meddling owners, everything we didn\u2019t want to be,\u2019 said Phil Neville. Gary Neville takes up the story. \u2018Phil and Paul became quite involved in the first three or four months and we found that what might have been seen as a positive didn\u2019t work out that way,\u2019 he said. \u2018The players would hear different voices \u2014 one week they would be there, the next they\u2019re not there. With coaching, it\u2019s about consistency and repetition. What was seen as being assistance for the previous manager and creating a buzz just didn\u2019t work. \u2018The sadness of it all is that we did lose a manager and it was not something we wanted to do. It was not something that we felt good about.\u2019 There have been other adjustments to the non-League level. \u2018You never win away games at night in midweek,\u2019 said Phil Neville. \u2018Players are tired after a day\u2019s work; often they\u2019ve rushed to the ground sometimes without eating properly; naturally they fade late on.\u2019 Former Manchester United striker Danny Webber now plays for Salford City . Salford City's game against Clitheroe Town on Saturday was free admission for fans . Captain Christopher Lynch works a night shift loading gas bottles, physically demanding work, and usually has to come off after 70 minutes in evening games to go to work. The owners have tried to address the fatigue problem, with the team meeting in a hotel for salad, pasta, chicken and salmon a few hours before their matches. \u2018At the start of the season we had a perfect vision that we\u2019ll have the manager now for the next 20 years and we\u2019ll have a set of young players and they\u2019ll see us all the way to the Football League,\u2019 said Phil Neville. \u2018But as time has gone on, we\u2019ve learnt from speaking to teams that have come through the divisions, like Fleetwood, Fylde and AFC Wimbledon, that you have to be ruthless.\u2019 If there has been a loss of innocence, there is at least a better understanding of an owner\u2019s lot. \u2018You can understand how, when emotions are running high, owners can make bad emotional decisions like bringing players in on big money and putting yourself under financial pressure,\u2019 said Phil Neville. \u2018I can see how it runs away with you. When you lose a couple of games you think: \u201cOh, we need a new player. Let\u2019s just push the budget out a little bit and we\u2019ll make it back here.\u201d But you never make it back.\u2019 LEFT TO RIGHT TOP ROW - Phil Neville, Robbie, Savage, Raimond Van Der Gouw, John O'Kane, Mikael Silvestre, Quinton Fortune . LEFT TO RIGHT BOTTOM ROW - Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Raphael Burke, Ryan Giggs Paul Scholes line up for a Class of '92 v Salford City match last August . Gary Neville added: \u2018When we jumped into this we thought this is going to be a big challenge and a lot of people are going to be looking at how this goes. But actually, no matter what happens, if we\u2019re still watching this level of football in five years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll be disappointed because we won\u2019t have progressed, but we\u2019ll still be happy every week. \u2018It brings us back down to earth.We might be coaching with England or United or doing a Premier League game or Champions League game in Barcelona. Then three days later you\u2019re at Brighouse away or Ossett Town and there\u2019s a tea lady at half-time saying: \u201cDo you want a cup of tea, love?\u201d It\u2019s just real. People at this level do it for the passion of their clubs and their communities. And though Giggs and Butt haven\u2019t been able to attend as much, because of their coaching duties at Manchester United, Scholes and Phil Neviile clearly feel the same. \u2018At the start we asked ourselves why we were doing it,\u2019 said Phil Neville. \u2018But when you come down to training, go to matches and mix with the supporters, it just feels real. \u2018There\u2019s a simplicity at this level. It\u2019s exciting to watch. I know we want the game to be played in a beautiful way but there is also something beautiful about the style at this level. The roots of English football are actually in the Evo-Stik League.\u2019",

In line with EU regulations, the first line of treatment for organic fish should be 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution', before . British and Norwegian vets have called the directives 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' 'Risk': Under EU regulations, organic farmers must first use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution' to treat ill fish, which has been criticised by British and Norwegian vets (stock image) The directives, outlined in the 2009 European regulation on organic aquaculture, are set to be brought into national law in non-EU Norway, which has caused vets to see red. Section 7 of the regulations calls for organic farmers to use 'substances from plants, animals or minerals in a homoeopathic dilution', as their first port of call when their fish are ill . After this, the 'veterinary treatments' section outlines that farmers may use  'plants and their extracts not having anaesthetic effects'. As well as the directive to use homeopathic treatments, organic fish farmers are only allowed to resort to mainstream medical treatments a maximum of twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification. This has been criticised by the \u00a0Norwegian Veterinary Association (NVA) as could mean that fish are not getting the correct treatment in time, causing them unnecessary suffering. Danger: British and Norwegian vets have called the EU directives on organic fish treatment 'scientifically illiterate', saying that the use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment' 'We think it's totally unacceptable from a scientific point of view because there's no scientific basis for using homeopathy,' Ellef Blakstad, the head of the Norwegian Veterinary Association, told The Local.no. 'If you start using homeopathy, you prolong the time when the animals are not getting adequate treatment and that's a threat to animal welfare.' Harsh: Farmers are only allowed to use mainstream medical treatments a twice per year, or their fish will lose its organic certification (stock image) The criticism from Norway has been echoed by the British Veterinary Association, saying use of homeopathy could lead to 'serious animal health and welfare detriment.' The British Veterinary Association (BVA) cannot endorse the use of homeopathic remedies, or indeed any products, making therapeutic claims, which have no proven efficacy,' British Veterinary Association President John Blackwell told MailOnline. 'As with any treatment for disease using medicines, BVA believes that veterinary medicinal products must be evidence-based, with any medicinal claims made by a manufacturer supported. 'If homeopathic remedies are used without proven effectiveness on farmed fish across the EU, including the UK, the consequence could be serious animal health and welfare detriment, which would be counterproductive to both animal health and to the farmed fish industry in the UK.' Homepathic treatments are based on the principle that 'like cures like', whereby a highly diluted substance that causes the symptoms  in a healthy person, can also cure similar symptoms in a sick person. A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos, and that the principles on which homeopathy is based are 'scientifically implausible'.",

Unless one of the top four falter dramatically in the final six Premier League games of the season, Liverpool will also miss out on Champions League qualification after only a season back in Europe's elite club competition. Brendan Rodgers undoubtedly needs to reinforce his squad, and Sportsmail assesses Liverpool's chances of landing five of their main targets. DANNY INGS,\u00a0BURNLEY . Danny Ings has impressed at Burnley this season and is set to leave Turf Moor when his contract expires . Mario Balotelli (left) and Rickie Lambert appear set to depart Liverpool at the end of the season . Liverpool have made their play for Ings but his concern has always been that he gets a fair chance of making a starting place his own. The Reds will look to shed Borini, Lambert and Balotelli but Divock Origi arrives from Lille in June too. Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Sociedad remain in the frame for Ings. COST: \u00a0\u00a34million compensation fee . JAMES MILNER,\u00a0MANCHESTER CITY . Has been a little upset by all accounts that his move to Liverpool was reported almost as a done deal. James Milner appears set to depart Manchester City at the end of the season when his contract expires . Milner (right) is also a target for Arsenal and Everton, as well as Serie A sides Roma and Inter Milan . Wants to see what City discuss first and it is all about how many games he plays. Arsenal, Everton, Roma and Inter Milan have also spoken to his representative about a summer deal. COST: Free . PETR CECH,\u00a0CHELSEA . Liverpool have been frustrated in their pursuit of Norberto Neto from Fiorentina, who is destined for Juventus. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech (right) appears likely to depart Stamford Bridge before next season . Cech could be out of reach for Liverpool if Paris Saint-Germain make a move for the goalkeeper . They want Cech but don't have the budget to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, who are confident of signing the experienced Chelsea goalkeeper this summer ahead of Arsenal. COST: \u00a310million . ASIER ILLARRAMENDI,\u00a0REAL MADRID . Stylish young central midfielder who has lost his way among Real Madrid's stars. Asier Illarramendi may depart Real Madrid this summer and his profile matches Liverpool's recruitment policy . Has stated a desire to fight for his place but knows chances are limited. Liverpool like him, as they do Ruben Neves at Porto also, but face competition from Arsenal and Real Sociedad although Arsene Wenger has other targets too for that area. COST: \u00a318million . MEMPHIS DEPAY, PSV EINDHOVEN . Fits the bill for Brendan Rodgers in terms of pace and pressing style and carries a goal threat. PSG have also made enquiries, as have United, who hope Louis Van Gaal's presence can sway the deal their way. Memphis Depay (right) is an ideal signing for Brendan Rodgers, but he must compete with Europe's elite side . If Liverpool fail to qualify for the Champions League it may be another deciding factor for the Holland international winger. COST: \u00a325million .",

Retired chief executive Ren\u00e9 Dee watched as his wife Eileen, 68, slipped away just days after catching the infection and before the couple's son had a chance to say goodbye. The 69-year-old said: 'It was such a shock, one minute everyone was telling her how well she was doing and the next moment I am watching her struggling to breathe. It happened so quickly.' Ren\u00e9 Dee had to watch as his wife Eileen, 68, died just days after catching a lethal infection. She had been battling cancer when she caught the bug while undergoing treatment\u00a0at the Royal Sussex County Hospital . Eileen had received a positive prognosis while being treated for her cancer but died because of an infection\u00a0at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. Several hospital rooms, including Eileen's, were found to have traces of the drug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa in water running from the tap and in the shower drain. Raw sewage was also discovered coming up from the shower drain in the room next door to Eileen. Doctors, concerned for her health, transferred Eileen to another hospital while an exploration of drains and an intensive clean of all side rooms, including the one the retired NHS information manager was in, was carried out. The infection was specifically detected in Eileen's room but there were no notes accompanying her transfer to say that she had been exposed to the potentially lethal infection. She died five days later. The Royal Sussex had put new measures in place after an outbreak of the same infection in 2010, it has also emerged. These included a thorough review of cleaning rounds. But it was revealed following an internal Serious Incident Investigation that only about a third of hospital housekeepers were cleaning to the required standard when Eileen died. Initially, Eileen, who was diagnosed with acute myloid leukaemia, had been intent on just receiving palliative care because she had watched her mother die of cancer. But when she was told she would respond well to chemotherapy and had a good prospect of survival, she changed her mind. Mr Dee said: 'She was very scared and very worried about going through the process of what her mother went through, which was a very long, drawn-out process and very unpleasant. Legal action: Mr Dee is now suing the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust for clinical negligence . \u2018They were just about to introduce her to another lady, of a similar age, who had been through the same condition and had successfully come out the other side. \u2018That was just about to happen and then suddenly she was gone.\u2019 He added: \u2018Eileen has missed out on the prospect of being a grandmother, which is something she would have loved. \u2018One of the most difficult decisions I have had to make was when to get my son, Matthew, home from overseas. But by the time I was very, very sure he should, and phoned him to say \"get over here now\", it was too late.\u2019 Healthy people are rarely affected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common bacteria, but it has become a major cause of healthcare-related infections, especially for those with compromised immune systems like Eileen\u2019s. The 68-year-old died in August 2013. Her cause of death was recorded as pneumonia but the Royal Sussex\u2019s report says the coroner should have been made aware of the infection. Mr Dee is now suing the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust for clinical negligence. Melanie Minter, of Sussex law firm Mayo Wynne Baxter, said: \u201cWe say there were serious errors and gross negligence in respect of cleaning the haematology oncology unit.\u201d Last month, the Trust pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of putting patients at risk over a period of more than six years in relation to a separate outbreak of legionella. A spokesman said the Trust could not comment on Eileen\u2019s case while legal proceedings were ongoing.",

Mr Asbo, the swan believed to be his grandfather, was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 by river authorities after repeatedly attacking rowers. Scroll down for video . Watch out: Savage swan Asbaby has been pecking punters on The Backs area of the river in Cambridge over the Easter weekend . Up close: One resident who lives near the river said Asbaby 'sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers' Theft: Asbaby was seen attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman\u2019s handbag (above) Capturing the moment: Asbaby (pictured) is believed to be the grandson of Mr Asbo, who was moved to a location 60 miles away in 2012 . Pecking at the punters: The swan on the River Cam is said to be even more vicious than his father, Asboy, and grandfather, Asbo . Asbaby was seen at the weekend attacking tourists, eating sandwiches, drinking from water bottles and even trying to steal a woman\u2019s handbag. He is said to have inherited his bad temper from his grandfather, and his father Asboy, who conducted a reign of terror on the river last summer. Harry Crossell, 65, who lives near the river, said: \u2018He is even more vicious than his father and grandfather. '(He) sticks his neck right into the punts and boats to nip passengers. I\u2019ve seen him chasing after punts and taking their picnics. 'Once I even saw him put his beak around a bottle of champagne. \u2018It\u2019s terrifying for river users and it\u2019s making people think twice about going out on the water.\u2019 Another resident, Simon Patterson, 52, said locals were worried Asbaby\u2019s behaviour would get worse as he gets older. \u2018The swan is only young at the moment, we\u2019re concerned he will get stronger and more vicious as he grows bigger,\u2019 he said. Shock: The swan got up close with this woman, whose surprise at what was unfolding in front of her could clearly be seen (right) Making an appearance: The juvenile swan nicknamed Asbaby got far too close for comfort to tourists on the Cam over the Easter weekend . Naughty swan: One resident said locals were worried Asbaby\u2019s behaviour on the River Cam would get worse as he gets older . \u2018He swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way. We thought Mr Asbo and Asboy were bad, but this swan is even worse. \u2018It\u2019s very worrying as the river is starting to get busier now, if he continues someone could get really hurt.\u2019 But Colin Sparkes, navigation officer for Conservators of the River Cam, told MailOnline today: \u2018Most swans get a bit aggressive this time of year. \u2018It's mating season - they protect their territory. As far as I\u2019m aware, it's not causing great problems on the river. \u2018Swans this time of year start to look out for their nest, and indeed when the young and born. \u2018It\u2019s a very tricky one because the more people feed the swans, the more aggressive they tend to become. Close to the camera: Asbaby 'swims up and down the river chasing anything which gets in his way', according to one local resident . Worrying:\u00a0Asbaby's actions are said to be 'terrifying for river users' and are 'making people think twice about going out on the water' Threatening: The behaviour of Mr Asbo (above) before he was moved 60 miles three years ago left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises . No longer there: The Cam Conservators moved Mr Asbo about 60 miles away in 2012. His son Asboy is seen above in this file photograph . 'They get used to swimming up to people expecting to be fed.\u2019 He confirmed that there are no plans to remove Asbaby from the river, adding that the case of Mr Asbo was completely different. Mr Sparkes said: \u2018That swan (Mr Asbo) was extremely aggressive - it's the most aggressive swan I've ever come across. \u2018I believe that was probably down to the way he'd been brought up looking for food from various people.\u2019 The Conservators\u00a0moved Mr Asbo away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises - and a marshal was employed during a university rowing race to stop him injuring students. It has previously been reported how Asboy was seen attacking punters, birds and even a cow. He also injured a canoeist and a swimmer.",

The Reverend Andrew Dotchin, 58, a well-known local character popular with his parishioners, was celebrating the end of Lent when he was refused entry at The Wine Bar in Ipswich. He was told there were health and safety concerns, because a glass could fall on his foot. Rev Dotchin, who preaches at Whitton Parish Church, said: 'I was gobsmacked.

'I don't get served in sandals in golf clubs but women do,' said Andrew, the son of a Royal Navy submariner. It's silly really.' The bizarre run-in sparked a flurry of activity supporting him on Facebook, which he labelled 'hilarious'. Wine bar manager Luke Parkerson defended the decision to bar Mr Dotchin. He said: 'Unfortunately it's because we are a glass-led venue - a lot of venues in Ipswich use glass substitutes now. 'All it would take is someone to drop a glass on an exposed foot - that was our concern. 'It has happened once before and I am very aware of it and don't want anyone to have it again.

'I am infamous for only ever wearing sandals because I find socks devilish! 'I'll go back there again and hopefully they'll let me in next time,' he said.

A jury deliberated about 2\u00bd hours before returning guilty verdicts against Benjamin McNamee, 25; Aaron Golson, 22; and Darryl Cearnel, 28. They will be sentenced June 26, according to Orange County, Florida, online court records. Until then, they'll be held in the county jail.

The initiation required pledges to run down the center of the bus while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. A medical examiner ruled Champion's death a homicide and said he died within an hour of being beaten. Champion suffered multiple blunt trauma blows, the medical examiner said. A total of 15 defendants were charged originally, but most took plea deals, WFTV reported. Last October, Dante Martin stood trial and was convicted of the same charges.

This was a brutal mismatch and a shattering result, not just for the ambitious Saints but for the English game as a whole. Jim Mallinder\u2019s men are imperious in domestic rugby \u2014 leading the league by 10 points \u2014 but they were simply obliterated by the formidable Top 14 giants. Clermont are nigh-on invincible at home and Northampton could do absolutely nothing to even fleetingly threaten their dominance in this raucous arena. Even in the brief moments when the Saints had the temerity to work up a head of steam and go through the phases, they were pounded back in the tackle and turned over time and time again. Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) scores his second try against Northampton . What unfolded was one-way carnage. France wing Noa Nakaitaci scoring two tries before half-time and Nick Abendanon, the ex-Bath and England full-back, capped a masterful display with a break-away try from 90 metres out. All the while, Brock James kept cranking up the points tally with supreme goal-kicking. Aside from the misery of being dumped out of the Champions Cup in such emphatic fashion, the concern for the Saints will be that this grim rout critically damages their confidence at a key stage of the season. For Northampton and England, there may also be worries over two leading forwards, as Courtney Lawes failed to reappear after half-time and Alex Corbisiero went off, apparently suffering pain in his right knee. Nick Abendanon of Clermont dives over to score a try at the Stade Marcel-Michelin . It was over as a contest long before half-time. There was a pronounced intensity deficit between the sides from the off, with Northampton losing the collisions and appearing somewhat sluggish in contrast to their fired up and energetic opponents. The procession began in the fifth minute when the Saints conceded an early scrum penalty. James landed his first shot at goal and the hosts were on their way. There was so much pressure from Clermont that it was just a matter of time before the Northampton defence was breached. Sure enough, the first try came in the 13th minute, as Fritz Lee blasted clear from a lineout on the right and he released Wesley Fofana. Abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory . The France centre was tackled in the 22 by Lee Dickson, but the attack continued at a furious tempo and, when Nakaitaci carved inside off his left foot, he was half stopped, but managed to climb up off the turf, stretch and touch down. The try was confirmed by the TMO and converted by James. It didn\u2019t help the Saints\u2019 already bleak cause that they missed their first scoring chance. After Courtney Lawes had pinched a Clermont lineout throw, the visitors won a penalty but Stephen Myler was off target with the kick. James landed another penalty, then came the two-try barrage which buried Northampton\u2019s hopes of a famous result. At the heart of the onslaught was Abendanon. First, his break laid the platform for Fofana to burst deep into enemy territory and after Napolioni Nalaga was tackled short of the line, the ball was switched right and James\u2019 lofted pass sent Nakaitaci over for his second try. Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . James converted from a wide angle then two minutes before the break, the blitz continued. Jonathan Davies made ground in the centre, Fofana picked out Abendanon and he raced into space, drew the last defender and passed back inside for the home No 12 to charge clear and touch down. Once again, James added the extras and the Saints were sunk. After the break, James struck another penalty before Abendanon made his long-range dash to the line in the 55th minute, for another converted try. Eventually, with Julien Bonnaire in the sin-bin, Alex Waller crashed over to give Northampton something to show for all their desperate toil, but it was far too little, far too late. The horse had bolted. The game was up.",

Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same \u2018uniform\u2019 \u2013 an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette \u2013 every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.' In an article for\u00a0Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction. Scroll down for video . Empowering:\u00a0Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform' 'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. '[I kept thinking], \"Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?\" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.' Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss\u00a0looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all. 'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers . She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days. 'I\u2019ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.' With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair . But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers. She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing. But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?' Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before? 'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.' According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices.\u00a0'People have really put it to the test, and I\u2019m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I\u2019m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains. All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money\u2013 and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control. Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe. 'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I\u2019d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I\u2019m not here for the uniform.' She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them. 'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'",

He's jailed in Van Buren County, Michigan, pending extradition proceedings. A passer-by found the girl Tuesday evening along a roadside near the forest preserve in Prospect Heights. She was crying and waving her hands. The Cook County Sheriff's Office says the girl could only provide her first name and was identified after investigators learned her mother was in the process of filing missing person reports for Aliya and Ikramulla.

In May 2014 he was arrested the Wisconsin man was arrested in Portage, accused of violently attacking police officers during a traffic stop and shouting God is great in Arabic. He was covered in bruises and red marks at the time of his mug shot. At the time Ikrumulla was charged with two counts of battery to law enforcement, three counts of resisting law enforcement, four counts of criminal recklessness and two counts of leaving the scene of an accident, NWI.com reported last year. He was also charged with misdemeanors including two counts of battery to law enforcement, two counts of resisting law enforcement and four counts of criminal recklessness.",

The 16-year-old was part of the Chelsea Under 19 team that won the UEFA Youth League by beating Shakhtar Donetsk in Monday's final in Nyon, Switzerland. And former Arsenal and England striker Wright took to Twitter to praise him, saying: 'Congrats to Chelsea winning UEFA youth league. Jay da silva left back better player than any current prem left back.' Jay Dasilva has been praised by Ian Wright following his performances in the UEFA Youth League . Dasilva is better than any current Premier League left-back, according to Wright . Wright has predicted that four of the Chelsea side are set for a bright future in the game . In a later tweet, Wright also tipped Dasilva's team-mates Tammy Abraham, Charly Musonda and Charlie Colkett to enjoy bright futures in the game. Chelsea became the first English team to win the Youth League after two goals from captain Izzy Brown and another from Dominic Solanke led them to a 3-2 win. Dasilva, who hails from Luton and was signed by Chelsea aged 12, is an attack-minded left back who can also operate as a winger. Despite a slight build, he is able to make his presence felt and is quick going forward in possession of the ball and when tracking back.

Dominic Solanke celebrates after scoring Chelsea's second goal against Shakhtar Donetsk . He progressed quickly from the Under 15 team to the Under 18 side last season and helped Chelsea to their FA Youth Cup win over Fulham. He scored in the first leg at Craven Cottage. This season has seen further progress, with Dasilva making eight appearances in the Under 21 Premier League and nine in the Youth League run. He recently helped England's Under 17 team to this summer's European Championship finals and is set to feature in the tournament in Bulgaria next month. Abraham, the 17-year-old forward, has enjoyed a prolific season for the Chelsea Under 18 side, scoring 24 times in the league at that age group and adding four more in the Youth League. His six goals have helped Chelsea to a fifth FA Youth Cup final in six seasons - they will play Manchester City in the final, with the first leg scheduled for Monday.

Despite being embroiled in the very public and traumatic feud where the Vinceni girls were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's home in the middle of the night to go back to live with their father in 2012, the girls have established healthy and happy lives in Italy and speak to their mum every night. 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown interviewed the two eldest girls, Emily and Claire, who she described as elegant, gracious, reserved and studious, at their home near Florence and they expressed their\u00a0regret for the way they handled the dramatic exit. 'They are really well, really centred and settled,' she said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flashback to 2012:\u00a0These were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart when four young sisters were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's Sunshine Coast home in the middle of the night and forced onto a plan back to their father in Italy . The four Vincenti sisters, including the two older girls Emil and Claire, had a 'monster' of a father who abused them and their mother,or so the story went after the girls were removed from their home in dramatic circumstances and return to Italy . What had led up to the removal of the four sisters in Australia and their return to Italy was the fact that their mother had taken them from their home in Italy on a 'vacation' and never returned, claiming the girls' father Tomaso was an abuser . Laura Garrett (pictured) has consistently maintained that she was removing her daughters from Italy back to Australia for their own safety . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but they are happy and calm girls in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australia in late 2012 . 'They are really well, really centred and settled. 'They are elegant, gracious, reserved and studious,' 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'They are very calm.' Tara said the girls were somewhat aware of the hysteria the distressing scenes of their exit caused and 'have a bit of regret about how they handled it ... so public and being so vehement, but they were manipulated'. The girls are living positive and fruitful lives, attending school six days a week, talking about what they will study at university and going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence. 'They speak with their mother every night and their father believes it is best for them to have both parents in their lives,' Brown said. Despite claims by the girls' mother that they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with their father Tomaso. 'They are still children who have seen a very bitter custody fight and ultimately they would like to live with both of their parents.' This scene of one of the Tomaso girls in apparent distress outside her father's villa in Florence after the four sisters were taken back from Australia to Italy . Emily and Claire Vincenti (pictured) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in Italy with their father . The story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in Italy to hide out in Australia and now they were being sent back to the 'monster' against their will. The scenes of the girl's forced return caused widespread outcry, particularly as the girls' mother portrayed the cruelty of the Dad, and the girls - \u00a0then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught. That was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many Australians who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their Italian father as approved under Italian law. What had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from Italy without the knowledge or permission of that father, Tomaso Vincenti, and that the girls had been born in Italy and spent the greater part of their young lives there. Now 60 Minutes has returned to the village near Florence where the girls have been living with their Italian Dad and interview the two elder girls, Emily and Claire Vincenti and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother, Laura Garrett. Emily and Claire talked about their parents and were filmed going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but appear happy and calm in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australian in late 2012 . The dramatic turn in the lives of the Vincenti girls began in 2010, when they left Italy ostensibly just for \u00a0month's holiday back in Australia, with their mother's family on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Laura Garrett and Tomaso Vincenti had met when she was a schoolgirl and had gone to Italy as an exchange student. Her host family was Tomaso's parents and Laura and Tomaso fell in love. Laura became pregnant and the pair married. Ms Garrett gave birth to four healthy girls, but in 2007 when the youngest was only around \u00a0four years old she split from Tomaso. Under Italian law, both parents were granted equal custody. In 2010, Laura told Tomaso she wanted to take the girls back to Australia for a vacation. Ms Garrett told the Australian embassy in Italian entirely different story, that she was fleeing an abusive husband and father and she needed their assistance. Despite claims by the girls' mother than they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father Tomaso . Once back in Australia, Ms Garrett and her daughters settled down to life in Queensland for two years, until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to Italy. Now aged twelve to 17, the young women behave in complete contrast to the screaming, hysterical girls captured on camera in 2012. Just a day after being taken to their father's villa on the outskirts of Florence, the two older girls were filmed running to the front gates when they saw media camped outside and pleaded for reporters to help them return to Australia. The eldest girl was taken back inside by her father, while her sister clung to the gate as her grandmother urged her to return inside. She held onto the gate for an hour, during which local police and social workers arrived. The girls had not seen their mother since they left Australia, but after 60 Minutes went to Italy to film the story, Laura Garrett \u00a0has subsequently turned up for a three-day visit. Ms Garrett has previously said in the years since her daughter's return to Italy that the girls were unhappy. 'They don't seem to be settling,' she said in 2013. 'I keep getting constant requests from them to come home.' Tara Brown said the girls loved Australia and missed it, but they were calmly getting on with their lives and planning their immediate futures in Italy.

Rodgers questioned Sterling\u2019s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . It has been a chastening week for Sterling. Pictures were published on Sunday of him smoking a shisha pipe and a different set of images surfaced on Tuesday of Sterling and team-mate Jordon Ibe at a shisha cafe in London. The pictures are believed to have been taken last September. Liverpool offered no\u00a0comment on those photos.

On November 30, 2014, two young boys were playing on Maroubra Beach when they uncovered the body of a baby girl buried under 30 centimetres of sand. Now locals Filomena D'Alessandro and Bill Green have claimed the infant's body in order to provide her with a fitting farewell. 'We\u2019re local and my husband is a police officer and he\u2019s worked with many of the officers investigating it,' Ms D'Alessandro told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . A Sydney family have claimed the body of a baby girl who was found buried on Maroubra Beach (pictured) on November 30, 2014 . Filomena D'Alessandro and Bill Green have claimed the infant's remains, who they have named Lily Grace, in order to provide her with a fitting farewell . 'Above all as a mother I wanted to do something for that little girl,' she added. Since January the couple, who were married last year and have three children between them, have been trying to claim the baby after they heard police were going to give her a 'destitute burial'. 'The most frustrating part has been the wait and we didn't know when it was going to happen.' With the help of the local community they managed to raise enough funds to provide the baby girl, who they have named Lily Grace, with a funeral, even though they were 'prepared to pay for the funeral on our own'. Ms D'Alessandro said the Maroubra community were rocked by the discovery of the little girl's body last year. 'It\u2019s terrible, we had just heard about the other baby who had been dumped the week before in Quakers Hill. Despite a lengthy investigation NSW Police were unable to locate the family of the abandoned baby . The 'very small' infant was dug up about 50 metres away from the closest footpath leading off the beach . Lifeguards assisted police at the crime scene:\u00a0Officers dressed in full protective gear and masks removed the body at about 1pm . 'And to have it happen in Maroubra, it was just so shocking,' she said. A service will be held for Lily Grace on Wednesday at the\u00a0South Chapel at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park, and Ms D'Alessandro and Mr Green have asked anyone still wishing to donate to instead give money to the\u00a0Royal Women\u2019s Hospital. They will also be collecting funds from the Maroubra woman's workplace at Raine and Horne, and at the service this week to go towards the hospital. 'I think it\u2019s going to be very lovely, everyone\u2019s come together to put it together,' Ms D'Alessandro said of the upcoming funeral. The body of the baby girl, whose mother was never found, was discovered by two boys aged six and seven who were playing in the sand after their Nippers session. Aged six and seven, the two boys found the 'very small' infant while digging in the sand during their weekly Sunday morning session at the southern end of Maroubra Beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Maroubra Surf Life Saving is providing counselling for the two boys who discovered the body as well as other surf club members . At the time Inspector Andrew Holland urged the mother of the child to come forward and seek medical assistance . For some time the sex and age of the child was unable to be determined due to decompostion . Police were called to the scene at about 10:05am on November 30 to investigate the 'suspicious' incident. Officers dressed in full protective gear and masks removed the body by about 1pm on the same day. At the time Inspector Andrew Holland urged the mother of the child to come forward and seek medical assistance. Police are also trawled through hospital, and deaths, births and marriages records in the hope of identifying the baby. The grisly discovery came just over a week after a newborn boy was found abandoned in a 2.4 metre deep drain in Quakers Hill. A post mortem examination will be conducted to establish the cause of the child's death . Patrol Captain for Maroubra Surf Life Saving, Phil Dutton, said a lot of suspicious activity happens on the south end of Maroubra Beach and called for the installation of CCTV cameras . The mayor of Randwick City Council, Ted Seng,  said: 'South Maroubra is one of our more isolated beaches, but it is patrolled by Randwick Council Lifeguards and volunteer surf life savers from South Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club' There are also serious concerns for the wellbeing of the two young boys who found the decomposed remains. 'It's horrible, just awful,' a witness, Monica, said. 'The under six Nippers were digging in the sand and they found it,' one surf lifesaver, who did not wish to be named, told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's just awful. It will have traumatised the poor the kids for life, no matter how much counselling they get.' 'It hits so close to home. Especially after that baby was found in a drain last week,' the lifesaver added. Maroubra Surf Life Saving is providing counselling for the two boys who discovered the body, as well as other surf club members. The surf lifesaver also mentioned that the far south and north ends of the beach can be troublesome areas, saying that the lack of light or any kind of surveillance meant they attracted some questionable behaviour.

Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, their daughter Zoha, seven, and their three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one, were all caught on camera on a cross-Channel ferry. They left their home in Slough, Berkshire, without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which is out of character, police said. Scroll down for video . Detectives have released CCTV footage of   Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children, who have been reported missing from Britain, at a busy ferry port as they apparently head to Syria . Police say Mr Malik (pictured with one of his young children) had told his family he wanted to 'go and live in a Muslim country' and the family left without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to relatives, it is claimed . Members of Mr Malik's family tonight said they had been left 'completely devastated' and issued a desperate plea for the six to return home. In a statement, they said: 'We are totally distraught, upset and in shock' Police have warned that the Muslim family, who were last seen in Slough, Berkshire on April 7, may be heading to Syria. They are pictured at Dover port before catching a ferry to Calais, France on April 8 . The family, from Slough in Berkshire, are believed to have boarded the Dover to Calais ferry just after midnight on April 8 before travelling south through Europe including to Budapest in Hungary on April 12 . Protest: Malik, seen holding the 'hands off Muslims!' sign, outside Regents Park Mosque last year - next to him is Abu Rumaysah who jumped bail to flee to Syria . But radical preacher Anjem Choudary said yesterday Malik was a member of the banned group Al-Muhajiroun and a 'champion for sharia' who regularly attended the group's demonstrations. Neighbours said the family were known to police and had been questioned on suspicion of terrorist involvement four years ago. Uniformed police waited for the family for three days before talking to them, they said. There will now be questions for police after they failed to stop a suspected extremist from slipping out of the country with his family. Choudary said Malik remained 'very influential in the community' after Al-Muhajiroun was banned five years ago. 'Back in the day he was a member until the group was banned. He was still part of our demonstrations and lectures but I hadn't seen him for a few months,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'Asif is a very good friend of mine. I haven't seen him for a while but from what I gather in the reports he and his family have left the country.' He added: 'He is a very studious man, a very good Muslim character. He was always a champion for sharia and is very influential in the community.' Choudary also criticised the Government for trying to restrict British Muslims from travelling to Syria. 'I think they want to live under sharia and escape the oppressive life they have in this country and under this government,' he added. Asif Malik (left), 31, and his partner Sara Kiran (right), 29, were reported missing from Slough, Berkshire, after their childrenl failed to show up to school and their grandmother became worried about their whereabouts . Zoha Malik (left), seven, and Essa Malik (right), four, are among the family's four children who are missing . The family were last seen on Tuesday, April 7, and were captured on CCTV boarding a ferry from Dover to Calais on Wednesday, April 8. They are believed to have travelled south through Europe by train and were seen in Budapest on Sunday, April 12, before making their way to Turkey. Relatives reported them missing to police on Thursday and officers are concerned they may be seeking to travel to Syria. Last night, Malik's family said they were 'completely devastated' by the family's sudden decision to leave Britain. 'All we wish for is your safe return and especially the return of the children. We are not angry with you, we are just heartbroken,' they said in an appeal to him. Zakariya Malik (left), two, and\u00a0Yhaya Malik (right), one, were last seen with their family in Berkshire on April 7 . Mr Malik and Miss Kiran's last known address in Slough was in this block of flats (pictured on the left, above) Neighbours said today that police had broken down the door on Thursday night to enter the family's home . Thames Valley Police's Acting Deputy Chief Constable, John Campbell, said it was a 'real concern' they had reached Syria. 'I'm not suggesting for one moment that they are intending to join Islamic State,' he said. 'At the same time we know that [relatives] have voiced some concerns about the family's intentions. There's been a suggestion that [Malik] in the past has said that he would like to live in a Muslim state.' Acting deputy chief constable John Campbell (pictured at a press conference in Kidlington today) said Thames Valley Police is 'extremely concerned for the safety of this family, especially the four young children' The alarm was raised when some of the children failed to attend Claycots Primary School in Slough . Yesterday, the family's next-door neighbour said they had been in trouble with the police four years ago. He added: 'People were saying that they were extremists and that police were listening in on their phone calls. I think they were under surveillance. 'The police sat in the stairwell for three days waiting for them. 'It's such a shame. Those kids are now in danger because of what their parents believe in.'",

An economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $24 trillion, one that annually churns out the equivalent of $2.5 trillion, is under assault. However, I am not referring to one of the G8 economies, but to the \"super economy\" of the ocean. It's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast. The health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a WWF report released Thursday, Reviving the Ocean Economy. The report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by The Boston Consulting Group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the Global Change Institute of the University of Queensland. True, the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal. But it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations. The fact is that the ocean feeds us, employs us, offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world. The ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity, such as climate regulation and oxygen production, that are difficult to put in monetary terms. And while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives, no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us. A figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling: Seventy percent of the ocean's overall economic value relies on its continued health. Ocean assets like fisheries, coral reefs, mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them. That may seem like a far-off possibility to some, but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report. For example, 90 percent of the world's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited. And that is not all. By 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs, which have already been halved in the last few decades. This isn't just a concern for dive enthusiasts, but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks. The ocean is truly too big to fail. The loss of the ocean's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage. Fortunately, our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy, three of which are critical this year. First, the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being. Also, negotiators meeting in Paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change. And finally, leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years. The economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear, and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy. Reviving the Ocean Economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome, but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers. All this said, and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean's health has been its fastest in millions of years, there is actually some (potential) good news: If we act swiftly and with determination, marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly. Many local examples -- from the Mediterranean to the Mozambique Channel, from the Fiji archipelago to the Arctic -- show us that conservation, restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean, and the people who depend on it, can both prosper. Ultimately, the ocean bridges continents, connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource. But if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return, we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate. After all, it's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nJohn Carver has hit back at former Newcastle captain Michael Owen after he said they would lose every remaining match this season. The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side . Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe . Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 . Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone . Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. \u2018I could be nasty about Michael because let\u2019s not forget what happened when he was here,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018But listen, I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. \u2018They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where\u2019s that come from?\u201d.\u2019 He added: \u2018Let\u2019s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven\u2019t. I understand that. \u2018But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. \u2018There are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. \u2018It\u2019s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don\u2019t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don\u2019t see that.\u2019 Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. \u2018I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,\u2019 said United\u2019s head coach. \u2018And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.\u2019 Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea . Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The \u00a36million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game. But Carver said: \u2018You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, \u201cWhat a player he is\u201d. \u2018If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer. We just have to be patient with him.\u2019 Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having \u00a334million in the bank .",

Pep Guardiola, whose side were outplayed in Portugal on Wednesday, remains Manchester City's first choice to replace under-fire Manuel Pellegrini. He has a year remaining on his contract in Germany but a quarter-final Champions League exit, which now seems like a real possibility, could help persuade his employers let him go this summer.

That would work for City. While current manager Pellegrini has a year remaining on his own deal, he has come in for fierce criticism following the stunning collapse of City's Premier League title defence and appears to be waiting for the knockout punch to land. But is Guardiola the right man for the job? The boy from Barcelona is seen as a natural fit given his close relationship with City's executive pair Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, with whom he worked during a glittering stint at the Nou Camp, and his desire to play attractive, attacking football. However, City's Abu Dhabi owners famously crave Champions League progression and, based on recent evidence, there may be some doubt as to whether Guardiola can deliver that. The 44-year-old's early record in the competition is stunning, lifting the trophy two times in three years - although he will not inherit a team featuring the likes of Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi in Manchester. And a glimpse at his away record in the knockout stages of the competition might suggest all is not as it seems. In 17 matches on the road in Europe, Guardiola's teams have won just four times, drawing eight and losing five. He has never exited before the semi-final stage but has twice bowed out to teams deemed inferior. Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in 2010 and Roberto Di Matteo's Chelsea in 2012 would both go on to win the tournament but both were rightly seen as no match for the Catalans before the ties kicked off. Guardiola has a year remaining on his contract but a quarter-final Champions League exit could be a problem . Pellegrini looks set to lose out on the Premier League title and is fighting to qualify for the Champions League . As a player . Barcelona B:\u00a0Segunda Division B . Barcelona: La Liga (6), Copa del Rey (2), Supercopa de Espana (4), European Cup,\u00a0UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, UEFA Super Cup (2) Spain: Olympic Gold Medal . As a manager . Barcelona B: Tercera Division . Barcelona: La Liga (3), Copa del Rey (2), Supercopa de Espana (3), Champions League (2), UEFA Super Cup (2), FIFA Club World Cup (2) Bayern Munich:\u00a0Bundesliga, German Cup,\u00a0UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup . At Bayern, where he pitched up after a year's sabbatical in 2013, the European adventures have been no better. In his first season they saw off a sleepwalking Arsenal side and David Moyes's comatose United before Real Madrid crushed them 5-0 on aggregate including that seismic 4-0 thumping at the Allianz Arena. On Wednesday, another away day defeat left Guardiola on the brink of his earliest exit yet. There may have been mitigation, with the likes of Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery missing but odds of 4-1 for a home win suggested the scale of the offence. Bayern may well turn it around next week and many would hail it as the latest of Guardiola's achievements - and there are many. In his first season at the Nou Camp, where he went from ball boy to legend, Barcelona won every competition they competed in. He lifted 14 trophies during his stint with his hometown club but when he left, while there was plenty of sadness, few did not believe it was the right decision with nemesis Mourinho polishing a first La Liga trophy in four years at the Bernabeu. At Bayern, he lifted the Bundesliga in his first season on a playing field about as level as the nearby Alps and looks set to do so again but will that be enough? Guardiola gives instructions to Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller during their Champions League defeat . Guardiola's teams have won just four times, drawing eight and losing five, in 17 matches away in Europe . If Bayern were to turn it around next week then it would be up there with Guardiola's best achievements . Would Jurgen Klopp, used to grinding out results with less talent at his disposal and suddenly available, be a better candidate? It is unlikely the powers that be at City will think so as, playing style aside, there are other reasons why Guardiola is the preferred choice. As he's shown more than once, Guardiola is not afraid to move big, ageing names on, something that would be music to the ears of the Etihad faithful. At the Nou Camp he showed the likes of Samuel Eto'o, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and none other than a certain Yaya Toure the door. His belief that reputations count for nothing, shared by another manager currently plying his trade in Manchester, could be just what City need. Jurgen Klopp is another who has been linked with a move to the Premier League . The Borussia Dortmund manager confirmed he will be leaving the German club at the end of the season .",

These vintage posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience, passengers wore their best clothes and there was plenty of legroom. They\u2019re featured in a new coffee table book, Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975, which revisits a time when the skies were dominated by the likes of Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) and Continental. Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda\u2019s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in\u00a0Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist . British Overseas Airways Corp led to the creation of British Airways (left) while Continental merged with United Airlines' parent company . It was a time when it cost an incredible amount of money to purchase a ticket for a commercial flight, with many of the ads promoting transatlantic or transpacific travel. The adverts created for the biggest airlines of the day, including many which no longer exist, offer a glimpse at how air travel, advertising and society changed over the 30-year period covered in the book. From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart .

In addition to drawings the adverts include photos of natural beauty spots, including Sydney Harbour (left) and Bermuda's beaches (right) Mr Huhne\u2019s book hails their creative genius and uses 17 colours, five types of varnishes and two methods of foil printing and embossing to replicate their work as accurately as possible. Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 was published by Berlin-based Callisto Publishers, which offered this synopsis of the tome: \u2018It provides unique insight into the design and advertising methods of an era when airlines were considered the most glamorous business sector and quality was the main criterion for selecting a flight.\u2019 It retails from approximately \u00a3270 online in the UK and from $250 online in the US.",

Goals from Neymar and a double from Luis Suarez, made sure the La Liga leaders travel back to Spain delighted with the result and their performance. Here Sportsmail\u00a0rates the players in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. Luis Suarez was the star man for Barcelona and scored a brilliant second-half double to put them in control . Paris Saint-Germain (4-3-3) Salvatore Sirigu - 6 - Commanding in the air with a disjointed defence in front of him but could do nothing to stop Neymar's cool finish. Gregory Van der Wiel - 5.5 - Unlikely to have started had Thiago Silva and David Luiz been fit to play the full game and was struggled to cope with Neymar's trickery, speed and movement. Marquinhos - 6.5 - Another bold performance from the Brazilian. Difficult to believe he is only 20 years old. Barcelona's front three still had their moments but Marquinhos was generally in control. Thiago Silva - 5.5 - Injured early on and replaced by his compatriot David Luiz. PSG need their skipper back if they are to turn this around in the Camp Nou. PSG (left) missed their skipper, who was forced off, and will be praying he can play at the Nou Camp . Maxwell - 6 - The former Barcelona full-back will have been grateful for the suspension of Daniel Alves, allowing him a less stressful evening from a defensive point of view against the more conservative Martin Montoya. Good delivery going the other way. Blaise Matuidi - 7 - Powerful and determined, he inherited the captain's armband when Silva went off injured and produced a relentless midfield performance. You can understand why Manchester United scouted him so closely last season. Yohan Cabaye - 5 - A dreadful lunge on Iniesta summed up a difficult first half for the Frenchman. Lacks the ball quality of Marco Verratti and the defensive acumen of Thiago Motta, who were sorely missed in the midfield. Booked. Former Newcastle United star Yohan Cabaye (left) struggled and looked out of his depth at times . Adrien Rabiot - 6 - A courageous performance from the youngster. Good energy and didn't shy away from the challenge. Ezequiel Lavezzi - 5.5 - Little impact from the winger. Moments of quality few and far between. Edinson Cavani - 5.5 - So often leaves you wanting more in these pivotal games. Denied by a marvellous Mascherano challenge in the first half but lacked the conviction to really take on the opportunity. Reported Manchester United target Edinson Cavani had no luck in front of goal and was wasteful . Javier Pastore 6 - Brilliant opening very early on in the game but miskicked badly. Subs . David Luiz (Silva, 21) - 5.5 - Was treated by a Russian doctor for his hamstring injury - recommended by Andre Villas Boas - in a bid to get back in time for the game. However, he didn't look fully fit and was exposed for Suarez's first goal. David Luiz (32) had a torrid time after he replaced Silva and was nutmugged twice for Suarez's two goals . Lucas (for Rabiot, 65) - 5 - Couldn't influence the game as Suarez strengthened his grip with second and third goals. Bookings: Cabaye . Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Bahebeck, Digne, Kimpembe . Manager: Laurent Blanc - 6 - Must have felt like he was playing with a player less with Verratti, Luiz and Ibrahimovic all unable to start. To lose captain Silva so early was a bitter blow, too, . Barcelona . Marc-Andre ter Stegen - 6 - Little chance with the consolation goal but one excellent stop to deny Cavani. Growing in stature. Martin Montoya - 6 - Lacks the marauding energy of Daniel Alves but didn't put a foot wrong in assured showing. Gerard Pique - 6.5 - Overcome the problems of earlier in the campaign and resembles a world-class centre back once again. Javier Mascherano - 8 - Such a brilliant reader of the game. Several superb challenges and his transition from midfield to defence has been almost seamless. No wonder Roy Hodgson admires him so much. Javier Mascherano proved how important he is to Barcelona with another impressive display at the back . Jordi Alba - 6.5 - Usual energetic self, offering menace in attack and robust defending. Sergio Busquets - 7 - The pivot that holds this Barcelona midfield together. Precise on the ball and his movement without it is terrific. Ivan Rakitic - 5.5 - Quiet night and not at his creative best. Still a way to go to demonstrate he can hold a place in this team in the long-term. Andres Iniesta - 6 - A first touch that should be taught to every child with aspirations of making the grade in the game. Usual excellent movement and passing. Luis Suarez - 8.5 - Quiet first half but came alive in scintillating fashion to decide the game and almost definitely the tie. Suarez was in top form and embarrassed Luiz for his two goals, showing off his genius ability . Lionel Messi - 6.5 - Sliced PSG apart with surgical precision to set up Neymar's opening goal. Neymar - 7.5 - There had been suggestions Neymar is unhappy that his manager replaces him so regularly during games. An early goal, tucked away so clinically, is a good way to stop that happening. Lionel Messi was instrumental in the opening goal for Neymar and was tidy throughout the clash . Neymar opened the scoring with a neat finish and cause Van der Wiel a number of problems throughout . Subs not used: Bravo, Pedro, Rafinha, Bartra . Bookings: Pique, Messi . Subs . Xavi (for Iniesta, 53) - 6 - Still the same midfield metronome. Didn't waste a pass. Mathieu (for Rakitic, 74) - 5 - Might have done better to prevent the PSG consolation. Adriano (for Montoya, 80) - 5.5 - Game was won but kept things ticking over. Man of the Match: Luis Suarez 8.5 . Manager: Luis Enrique - 7 - Has recovered from the ordeal of the first half of the season and his side are heading towards a triumphant end to the campaign. Fearsome front three could carry Enrique to European glory. Referee: Mark Clattenburg (England) - 7 - Didn't put a foot wrong and it may be that our leading official progresses some way further than our leading sides in this competition.",

'The difference is that it is a little bit further away from the coast and it is in a different area - so the heavy rain is probably not going to be over Sydney.' Ms Westcott said the weather system appeared to be moving quickly. 'We might get two days of rain but it's not likely to be the same three days of wind and rain we saw last week,' she said. Damage and destruction caused by flooding in Stroud in the NSW Hunter region . Bureau of Meteorology NSW regional director Barry Hanstrum said: 'Early indications suggest the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the states north east including the Northern Rivers and Mid North coasts, with heavy falls also likely for southeast Queensland. 'Current guidance suggests that rain will increase this week, and peak between Thursday and Saturday. 'Further rainfall is likely for catchments that have already experienced flooding during last week\u2019s severe weather event.' The Bureau Of Meteorology said it was too early to tell how severe the weather system would be. Ms Wills said the SES would spend the next few days trying to complete as many jobs as possible, as well as warning people to prepare their homes should another severe storm hit. 'Obviously we're trying to get through has many as we can before next system hits,' she said. Ms Wills said there were over 1000 personnel in the field across NSW, including 200 from other states such as Queensland, Victoria, the ACT and South Australia.",

Cooler overnight temperatures and low winds allowed fire crews to attack the blaze, increasing containment from 15 per cent, though on-the-ground conditions did not make that fight easy. The fire burned in the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin, where vegetation has not burned in decades, according to Capt. Mike Mohler of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

A woman accused a married couple of rape after her boyfriend found out she had a threesome with them in a Travelodge hotel room. Hannah McWhirter, 21, of Banff, Aberdeenshire, engaged in the m\u00e9nage a trois with co-worker Dionne Clark and her husband Shaun in July 2013. She even exchanged texts with the couple after their threesome telling them how much she enjoyed herself. But when Mr Clark told the John Lewis department store worker's boyfriend about their hookup she claimed she had been raped. McWhirter appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where she admitted wasting police time with false rape claims. Fiscal depute Elaine Ward said the accused had become close friends with Mrs Clark, 29, after starting work in the same shop in January 2013. The court heard that over time Mrs Clark introduced McWhirter to her husband Shaun, 35. Mrs Ward said: 'Both Mr and Mrs Clark and the accused spent a lot of time together socially and exchanged texts and other media messages on a daily basis. 'The nature of their relationship became more intimate and in June 2013 they discussed having a threesome and booking a hotel for that purpose.' The court heard that on July 13 the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out, oblivious to what was going on. Mrs Ward said: 'On the following day the accused and Mrs Clark exchanged several text messages saying that they had enjoyed the previous night.' The fiscal depute said McWhirter and the Clarks continued to meet socially and appeared 'happy' in each other's company. McWhirter accused co-worker Dionne Clark and husband Shaun (pictured) of rape following the threesome . The court heard the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out . But the relationship started to deteriorate after McWhirter took a day to respond to a text from Mrs Clark about being admitted to hospital. Bosses at their work later found out about the incident but McWhirter denied that the threesome had happened during a meeting in September 2013. The court heard that a month later things took a turn for the worst. Mrs Ward said: 'On October 11, the accused's boyfriend was standing outside her place of work when Mr Clark advised him of the threesome and showed him text messages from the accused. 'This later resulted in the accused being confronted by her boyfriend. 'She initially denied that the incident had taken place, then admitted it but said it was forced.' The court heard their relationship ended and McWhirter returned to live with her mother - continuing to claim that the Clarks had raped her. McWhirter has now admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark (pictured on their wedding day) to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14 2013 . Police then began investigating her claims. McWhirter claimed she had been on a night out with friends before bumping into Mr and Mrs Clark. Mrs Ward said: 'She stated that at the end of the night she had to use the bathroom so went to their hotel room and then gave police details of a forcible rape.' The Clarks were interviewed under caution by police on October 16. However McWhirter's friends did not back up her night out story. After further mobile phone analysis took place in November 2013, McWhirter admitted she had been a willing participant. Yesterday she admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14, 2013. Sheriff Graham Buchanan deferred sentence until next month for the preparation of reports. McWhirter, who was released on bail, wept as she left the dock yesterday.",

Doctors told Cara Newton, 32, from Fleet, Hampshire, she had a zero per cent chance of conceiving naturally after being diagnosed with bone cancer in 2009. While Mrs Newton and her husband, Chris, 34, were relieved that chemotherapy had worked, they were devastated to be told they would never have a family of their own. Some chemotherapy drugs permanently stop the ovaries from producing eggs. This means a woman can no longer get pregnant and may have symptoms of the menopause, as Mrs Newton did. Cara Newton, 32 (with husband Chris), was told she had a zero per cent chance of conceiving naturally after being diagnosed with bone cancer in 2009. To her utter surprise, she conceived baby Sebastian naturally . Mrs Newton was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a rare type of bone cancer - in April 2009. She had to undergo several rounds of chemotherapy which doctors said would destroy her fertility . After IVF failed, the couple feared they would never become parents. But 10 months later they were astounded to discover Mrs Newton had become pregnant naturally with baby Sebastian, who was born last April . The couple tried IVF using a donor egg but when that failed, they feared the worst. Then 10 months later, to their utter surprise, Mrs Newton became pregnant naturally with baby Sebastian, who was born last April. She said: 'I was heartbroken when doctors told me I had zero chance of ever becoming a mum. 'Chemotherapy had taken my hair, made me sick and plummeted by body into early menopause. 'I had always wanted children but my hopes of having my own family had been destroyed overnight.' She added: 'Chris and I decided to try IVF using a donor egg. Even though the baby wouldn't biologically be mine, at least I would experience pregnancy and we would become parents.' 'When it failed I was gutted, but just months later I fell pregnant naturally, it was a dream come true. We had to keep pinching ourselves to check it was real.' Mrs Newton was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a rare type of bone cancer - in April 2009. She had become concerned after suffering from pain in her leg - something she first thought was a pulled a muscle. But an MRI confirmed her worst fears - she had bone cancer and could lose her leg. She said: 'I was terrified when I heard the word \"cancer\" and the amount of treatment I would need.' During surgery, Mrs Newton had 13cm of bone removed from her femur, which was replaced with a metal internal prosthesis. Mrs Newton had 13cm of bone removed from her femur, which was replaced with a metal internal prosthesis . She also underwent multiple rounds of chemotherapy, all the time worrying she would lose her leg. She said: 'I ended up in intensive care a couple of times as the chemotherapy made me so ill that my body couldn't cope with the treatment. Chemotherapy can stop a woman's ovaries from working either temporarily or possibly permanently. The extend of the damage on fertility depends on the drugs and doses a patient receives. Some chemotherapy drugs are also more likely than others to cause infertility. Permanent infertility is more likely if a patient have higher doses of the drugs. It is also more likely in older women, especially those nearing the age where they would naturally have a menopause. Some chemotherapy drugs permanently stop the ovaries from producing eggs. If this happens, a woman can no longer get pregnant and may have symptoms of the menopause. While it is not as easy for women to preserve their fertility as it is for men, but there are ways of doing it, such as freezing embryos, freezing eggs or freezing ovarian tissue. These techniques are done before the chemotherapy starts and involve having some eggs collected. Source: Cancer Research UK . 'I was in a situation where I had to continue with chemotherapy or the cancer would kill me - but at times it was a risk that the chemo could kill me. It was terrifying.' It was the support of her now husband that got her through the ordeal, she says. 'Chris was my rock throughout it all and he proposed to me when I finished treatment in 2010 but I wanted to wait until my hair grew back before we got married,' she said. After marrying the following year, the couple were overjoyed to be told Mrs Newton was in remission - and they turned their thoughts to starting a family. But the gruelling treatment Mrs Newton had undergone severely hindered their chance of conceiving. 'The treatment stopped us from trying IVF through using a donor egg straight away,' she said. 'And when it failed in October 2012 and I fought off two serious infections that could have cost me my leg, I felt as though I would never become a mum.' With Mrs Newton on strong medication until July 2013, they were unable to try for a baby. 'So when I fell pregnant naturally in August we both felt like it was a complete miracle,' she said. 'Being a mum to Seb is the best thing in the world, Chris and I finally have the perfect family we have always wanted.' She added: 'If someone could have told me five years ago that I would keep my leg, by cancer free and become a mum I would never have believed them.' She said:\u00a0'When I fell pregnant naturally, it was a dream come true. We had to keep pinching ourselves to check it was real' With Sebastian now a year old, she said:\u00a0'Being a mum to Seb is the best thing in the world, Chris and I finally have the perfect family we have always wanted' She has now shared her story will give other women hope. 'I hope my story shows other women who have battled cancer that despite going through the menopause after chemotherapy, that miracles do happen and that one day they could have a baby too.' Mrs Newton has also been supported throughout her illness by the Bone Cancer Research Trust. Julie Harrington, Bone Cancer Research Trust chief executive, said: 'Finding out you have primary bone cancer is devastating enough but to be told you may never have children as a result is a real shock. 'Cara has shown incredible bravery and strength throughout her journey and is now blessed to have a beautiful baby boy.' 'Every year in the UK and Ireland 600 families will be affected by this brutal disease which leaves long-lasting physical and emotional scars, even after treatment. 'Cara's story gives a ray of hope to others through their darkest times and we wish her and her husband all the very best for their new life as parents.'",

He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: \"Stop this Tim, don't do it\".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.'

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nSchool safety experts have reported a 'worrying increase' in e-terrorism, where threats are sent electronically - sometimes from thousands of miles away. The Ohio-based National School Safety and Security Services reviewed more than 800 school threats covered in the media during the first half of the 2014-15 academic year. Researchers found that about one-third of cases involved violent remarks sent anonymously via text message, social media, email or other online means. Law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit. Worrying trend: In this January 13, 2014 photo, students pass by Seven Lakes High School after being evacuated for the day after a bomb squad was called to remove a potentially explosive device . In many cases, swift action is taken with lockdowns and evacuations. However, authorities say the majority of the time  threats turn out to be hoaxes. Indeed, just this week a 16-year-old from Gateway High School in Kissimmee, Florida, was arrested for posting about a bomb threat on Twitter because 'she was angry and did not want to go to school,' according to the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. Complicating matters, the threats aren't just coming from within school walls or even a school's neighborhood. Last fall, Lakota Middle School in Federal Way, Washington, was placed in lockdown and police responded after an email purportedly from the Islamic State group demanded ransom money and threatened to 'shoot and kill' every American, according to a police report. A 14-year-old student was arrested after admitting the email had been sent by her online friend 'Ryan' after she told him to 'swat' her school because she thought it would be funny, police said. Anonymous: Law enforcement officers say the use of the modern technologies has made it that much harder to determine if a threat is real and to find the culprit (stock photo) 'Swatting' plays off the idea of issuing a threat that draws a SWAT team in response, disrupting activities at the target of the threat. It appears to have originated with pranksters in the online gaming community. In a separate case, a 14-year-old in western Michigan was ordered by a judge to pay nearly $8,000 in restitution to the Coopersville Area Public Schools and the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office for his involvement in a swatting incident that put schools in lockdown after a caller using computer-based technology made threats against the schools. Authorities say the call was made by a person code-named 'Ransom,' whom the teen had met online. 'Ransom' is believed to live in the UK and is suspected in a string of similar incidents from coast to coast, according to law enforcement. 'He will learn from this,' the teen's father said, according to the Grand Rapids Press in Michigan. The motivations of the threat makers vary, just as they did a generation ago when bomb threats were called in by pay phone: avoiding a test, revenge or simply to show off. With swatting, a motivation appears to be thrill-seeking, said Capt. Mark Bennett with the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office. It's not too difficult for students to figure out how to pull off such an incident, said Justin Cappos, a computer science professor at New York University who studies cybersecurity. 'You wander to the wrong parts of the Internet and you can learn how to do it and not get caught,' Cappos said. With each incident, there's a risk when authorities respond, said Detective Jerrad Ely, a digital forensics expert with the Mount Vernon Police Department in Washington who has been investigating a bomb threat case against a school in his community. 'They could inadvertently get hurt when police are just trying to do their jobs based on the best information that they have,' he said. Applications such as Burnbook, Afterschool, Yik Yak, Whisper and Kik also have been used by students to make threats anonymously. In Michigan, Superintendent Timothy Stein of the Flushing Community Schools wrote to parents in December informing them about a posting on Afterschool that said, 'Bringing a Gun to School.' The posting had been brought to the high school principal's attention by a text message; police quickly determined that it was not a credible threat. 'I encourage you to ask you child to stop using this app and remove it from their phone,' Stein said. Every threat has to be taken seriously even though in most cases the called-in danger is not real, said David Pennington, superintendent of schools in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and president of the AASA School Superintendents Association. Meanwhile, social media and other electronic means of communication are keeping parents informed about threats. Mindful of past school shootings, they are demanding that children be pulled out of school even as school and law enforcement officials investigate. 'The security of people has been greatly eroded in this country, as you know, just through awful things that have happened,' said Mark Davidson, deputy superintendent at the Federal Way Public Schools.",

Argentina international Aguero has scored six times against United since he joined City in 2011 . 'He scored many goals, and always needs to be watched carefully. If there is one player more than others to watch out for, I'd say it is Aguero.' Falcao did not feature at the Etihad earlier this season but is fully aware of what the derby means in the city. 'It really means a lot to our fans and theirs, so of course I'd be thrilled to play in this match on Sunday. The atmosphere will be phenomenal,' he said. 'In Manchester the derby means a lot. Unfortunately I didn't play in the derby earlier this season, but you could sense the atmosphere in the city for more than a week before the match itself, it was all people were talking about.' Falcao and Aguero came face-to-face at a Puma event on Thursday . Falcao (right) says he is happy at United despite playing a bit-part role for much of the season . Falcao says he is happy at United despite having to settle for bit-part role under Louis van Gaal. 'Every football player wants to play, that's very normal, but I respect the manager and the decisions he makes,' he said. 'I keep working hard in training, learning every day how to play in different systems, in different styles of football. 'Manchester United is a great club, I am very happy to be here and because of this I am happy to be patient.'",

The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just \u00a365 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just \u00a33,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant\u2019s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing \u2018management consultancy activities\u2019. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of \u00a33,378, down from \u00a318,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a \u00a345million house in west London - married the heiress in a \u00a37million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia\u2019s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated \u00a370,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone\u2019s family is worth an estimated \u00a33billion - and the couple are said to own a \u00a3300,000 Ferrari, \u00a3123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a \u00a3100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London . Company: Brigante Business Developments is based in this building (above) in Battersea, south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: \u2018Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.\u2019 Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone. He was robbed of a \u00a350,000 Rolex and a \u00a320,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV, but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence. MailOnline has approached a representative of the Ecclestone family for comment on the accounts.",

Kelley has been wanted since 2004, accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. His wife, Genevieve Kelley, who's charged with the same crimes, turned herself in to authorities last year, just a few months after the case was featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" Her trial is scheduled to start next month. The couple is accused of leaving New Hampshire, kidnapping Genevieve Kelley's daughter, Mary Nunes, and beginning a life on the lam when she was 8 years old. At the time, the child's father, Mark Nunes, had full custody rights. The search for the three spanned the United States, Canada and Central and South America. It ended on Monday, when Scott Kelley and Mary Nunes entered the U.S. Consulate in Costa Rica and requested passports so they could return to the United States. The consulate notified U.S. Marshals, Berry said, and when Kelley and Nunes flew to Atlanta on Wednesday investigators were waiting for them. Mary Nunes, now 19, was interviewed by investigators at the Atlanta airport to ensure her health and safety and then allowed to continue to her final destination, Berry said. Previously, authorities had said her whereabouts were unknown. CNN New Hampshire affiliate WMUR reported that the daughter plans to testify at her mother's trial. In a statement released through a private investigator he's hired in the case, her father said that he was thrilled to learn Mary is safe. \"We love Mary and are overjoyed that she is alive and back in the US. Our hearts and home are open to her, and we will do everything we can to insure she remains safe and healthy,\" Mark Nunes said in a statement. \"We remain concerned about her emotional and physical well-being. We look forward to the day our family is finally reunited.\" Kelley's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before allegedly fleeing the country, Genevieve Kelley had accused her ex-husband of abusing their child. Investigators found no basis for the accusations and no charges were filed. On a Facebook page defending her, supporters of the mother say she did what any parent would do under the same circumstances. Photos on the page show her standing with friends holding signs that say, \"Justice for Gen! Children need protection.\" Wayne Rioux, who was then the police chief of Whitefield, New Hampshire, told \"The Hunt\" that a video Genevieve and Scott Kelley made, intended to prove their abuse allegations, aroused his suspicions. Rioux watched the tape for \"any evidence of wrongdoing by Mark Nunes.\" \"But throughout the tape all I saw was this bizarre, strange conduct by the mother,\" Rioux said, \"who was absolutely brainwashing the daughter and trying to get the daughter to say things against her daddy.\" Attorney Alan Rosenfeld has argued that Genevieve Kelley had no other option than running away with her daughter, after a court-appointed guardian and social service agencies had said they didn't believe the abuse allegations. \"Simply put, there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child,\" he said earlier this year, according to WMUR. Earlier this year, Brazilian police tracked down Victor Arden Barnard, another fugitive who'd been featured on \"The Hunt.\" The 53-year-old American pastor is accused of dozens of sexual assaults in Minnesota. Last year, the same day Genevieve Kelley was arrested, authorities in Texas announced that in an unrelated case, remains found were confirmed to be those of another fugitive featured on the program, Kevin Patrick Stoeser. Stoeser, a U.S. soldier who was dishonorably discharged, pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars. Remains of Shane Miller, another suspect featured on the \"The Hunt,\" were found last year. And Charles Mozdir, another suspect who was profiled on the show, was killed in a gunbattle with authorities. CNN's Tricia Escobedo and Slma Shelbayah contributed to this report.",

The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the Iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year. Further delays to Sir John Chilcot\u2019s inquiry into the war were reported by BBC\u2019s Newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news. It was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for Labour. But it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry, which began in 2009, will not be published until 2016. Newsnight\u2019s Diplomatic Editor, Mark Urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016. Tony Blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion. The former PM has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry. Earlier this year, he apeared rattled when journalists put to him David Cameron\u2019s claim, that Labour had got the publication delayed. He pointed to a statement released by his office which said: \u2018It is not true to say that Tony Blair has caused the delay in the report\u2019s publication\u2019. Mr Blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised. Every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them, often running to hundreds of pages. The inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses. The publication of the report was expected to be delayed until after the election as it is thought to be highly critical of senior political figures, including Tony Blair, but will likely not report until even later .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)After two days of deliberation, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the Boston Marathon bombing. The verdict isn't surprising. What might be, however, is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again. Because there could be other more young men just like him, which means the lessons we take from Boston will affect whether we can keep America and Americans safer. Today, nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are Muslim. By 2050, Pew reports, that will be some 1 out of 3. By 2070? Well, I'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the Drudge Report: \"Muslims to outnumber Christians!\" Many Americans read such numbers and worry: Will this mean more Dzhokhar Tsarnaevs? But that's only if you believe Islam causes extremism, which many have argued. And that's wrong, of course. On the other hand, there are people who claim Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. Which is true \u2014 and false. Sure, the Islamic faith forbids murder, but there's a small but significant minority of Muslims murdering people in terrible ways, and in Islam's name. Understanding what leads young Muslims like Dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization. At any given moment in the Middle East, we have little idea who's going to attack whom next, who's on whom's side, how this is going to end, or what anyone's even fighting over anymore. This bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better. But it will get better. To understand why, we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes Muslims . Contrary to common belief, Muslims aren't unusually predisposed to violence. Radical Islam, which has taken on an ugly life of its own, began at the intersection of politics, religion and religious identity. Islam is about what you believe, but it's also about being part of a community. And what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack? Some Muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions (the road to hell, after all). Consider: The tragedy of modern Islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies. Before my time, the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan horrified many Muslims. When I was in high school, Bosnia occupied all our attention. There was of course Russia's brutal war on the Chechen people \u2014 Dzhokhar shares his name with a recent Chechen patriot --  and Israel's ongoing occupation of the Palestinian territories. And the blows against Muslims don't end there. There was Serbia's war on Kosovo, another war in Chechnya, the invasion of Iraq, oppression in Myanmar, civil strife in Syria, the colonization of East Turkestan, massacres of Muslims in the Central African Republic, wars on a besieged Gaza and West Bank still under Israeli rule. Imagine how this looks to a restless young Muslim. Countless places where co-religionists have been killed, and nobody seems to do anything about it. Nobody even wants to. Extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening, and then moved quickly to a single, tempting, terrible response: Take up arms \u2014 and kill. In her new book, \"Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now\", Ayaan Hirsi Ali argues that extremism isn't caused by political circumstances, but by Islam itself. Her conclusion is wrong. To fight extremism, we don't need to reform Islam. We need to show young Muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to. Rather than help Muslims, it's harming them. When I was a teenager, our Massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from Bosnia that shared graphic, heartbreaking stories of rape, exile, and massacre inflicted on Muslims, all because of their faith. The mosque raised money, collected food, blankets, medicine. Promises were made to provide more, and regularly. But we all knew that wasn't enough. As we left the mosque, my peers and I were disgruntled and confused. Shocked. Angry. Our teachers could've told us: Go and fight. Defend your Muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege. Or they could've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably. Neither answer would have satisfied. Fortunately for us, they offered us a third way. They showed us, patiently, how to work with others, how to compromise, how to get things done. A more engaged American Muslim community, they explained, could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world. They were right. We saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar, but we also saw, up close, how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless, ineffectual and ignored. Thanks to social media, a medium that the world's burgeoning young Muslim population is increasingly comfortable with, more Muslims can and will see this, too. Radicalism will be done in by fellow Muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it.  It's happening already. Our national conversation about Islam is focused on the wrong issues. Does Islam need a Reformation? What in Islam causes violence?  We would do a lot better if we accepted that Muslims the world over have real grievances \u2014 dictatorships, corruption, foreign intervention, religious illiteracy, lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these. We need to show the young Dzhokhars that, if they want to help, then violence isn't going to help. To fight extremism, we need to pose this question to young Muslims: \"Do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith?\"   Because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse. Their narrative has failed. Their solution is bankrupt. The Caliph wears no clothes. It's the reason why increasing numbers of Muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA recent college graduate diagnosed with genital herpes is stepping into the limelight in attempt to destigmatize STIs. Ella Dawson, a recent graduate of Wesleyan University who resides in New York City, was diagnosed with herpes two years ago and says she's been dropping the 'herpes bomb' about\u00a0six months after she had her first outbreak. In her essay for\u00a0Women's Health Mag, Dawson recalls meeting a boy at a party who offered her a sip of his beer. I have herpes: Ella Dawson has genital herpes and she is sharing her story so that less people with the virus can feel the guilt and shame that sometimes accompanies the common skin condition . 'Don\u2019t worry,' she remembers him saying. 'I don\u2019t have herpes or anything.' His words hit a sore spot for her and she felt compelled to share her sexual health status. '\"That\u2019s funny,\u2019 I said, with as warm a smile as I could manage. \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s really funny. Because I have genital herpes.\u2019 His face crumbled. Not because I grossed him out \u2014 I could practically see the wheels turning in his brain as he realized he\u2019d made an ignorant joke at someone else\u2019s expense. The guy started apologizing profusely,\"' she wrote in her essay. Dawson said that even though herpes is often the bud of the joke in popular culture, it's a real issue affecting at least one in six Americans. Dawson said that she felt empowered after telling someone she had herpes because it humanized the STI in a way that made it less of a stigma. 'I had seen in the flesh what a simple \"I have herpes\" could do when said fearlessly, without shame,' she wrote. 'Because when a real person \u2014 a woman you know and respect \u2014 casually mentions having herpes, it stops being a punchline and starts being someone's reality.' Don't strain: Dawson says that people who have herpes should not feel 'dirty or wrong' and should be aware that the virus is manageable and more common than people would expect . According to the CDC about 17 per cent\u00a0of people ages 14-19 have genital herpes caused by HSV2. That percentage is only of people who choose to get tested and the actual number of people who have the virus is likely much higher. Even having sex with a condom does not protect someone from the highly contagious virus that only needs skin to skin contact to spread, even if there are no sores present. The Washington Post reports that according to an advocacy group called Project Accept Herpes didn't become a stigma until after the 1970s. '[Herpes] was merely a cold sore in an unusual place until the 1970s,' the group says on their web site. Dr. Peter Anthony Leone, medical director of the North Carolina HIV/STD Prevention and Control Branch told The Washington Post that the stigmatization of the virus was fueled by conservatives after the 'free love era.' Courage: Ella Dawson has the courage to tell people about \u00a0her virus because it will humanize the problem for sufferers worldwide . 'Herpes was seen as this marker of being promiscuous or bad or evil,' he said. 'But unless you\u2019re in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone who has never had sex, you\u2019re at risk.' Leone said that the sex scare campaign was both emotionally traumatizing and also gave false information about the virus. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology conducted in 2011 found several survey respondents with STIs reported feelings like 'less of a person.' Leone said that safe sex is very important but that herpes is not merely a sexual condition but it primarily a skin condition. 'The way you remove stigma is by bringing something to light,' he said. 'We need a push coming at the federal level to talk about sex in terms of health and move away from the disease model. Sex should be seen as part of being an adult, a healthy thing you can do and just part of your routine healthcare.' Dawson told the Washington Post that she will continue to blog about the virus and her dealings with it. She said that ever since her article on herpes was published she has received several emails from people around the world sharing their own story. Don't sit in the dark: Ellas Dawson says that people should communicate openly about herpes since so many people have it .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nScottish football's relationship with television has become a form of Stockholm Syndrome. No one is tied up in a basement. There are no hostages. Yet the lengths to which the SPFL will go to show love to those broadcasters who hold a gun to their heads has become a source of growing, simmering public fury. The Scottish game is engaged in a Faustian pact. And the television piper is calling the tune. Sky and BT Sports pay \u00a316million a year for live coverage of Scottish football. The BBC puts in an estimated \u00a33m a year for Sportscene highlights and radio commentaries. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick during the win over Kilmarnock earlier this week . Compared with the \u00a35billion paid to English clubs for Premiership football the sums are trifling. Borderline insulting. St Mirren facing Ross County on a wet March night in Paisley will never be a rival to the Manchester derby but broadcasters don't show Scottish football out of charity. They do so because it fills their schedules and meets a level of demand. In return for which they regard SPFL football with indifference. The BBC, a state public service broadcaster, charges the same flat rate licence tax to viewers in London and Manchester as it does to viewers in Glasgow and Inverness, with one key difference. English football is treated with reverence and respect. Scottish football like a pavement beggar. On Saturday, Hibernian and Falkirk fans will be asked to travel to Glasgow for a Scottish Cup semi-final which kicks off at 12.15pm Why? Because Sky Sports want the game out of the way to show a recorded documentary on Bob Paisley. On Sunday, Inverness fans must travel 200 miles for another 12.15pm kick-off against Celtic. Topping the bill in the afternoon is the European Cup rugby semi-final between Leinster and Toulon, a game likely to prompt complete indifference in public houses the length and breadth of Britain. It's not just the Scottish Cup. Celtic have played just four home league games at 3pm on a Saturday all season. And the decision to put back the Hearts v Rangers Championship clash 24 hours for the benefit of Sky caused an almighty row while resurrecting the dreaded 'sporting integrity' phrase. Hibernian are engaged in a battle with the Ibrox side for second place in the Championship. This matters because the team which finishes second has two fewer tense, troublesome play-off games to play. Were Rangers to go into their final game at Tynecastle needing only a point against Hearts \u2014 Hibernian's city rivals \u2014 the game would be played against an unparalleled backdrop of suspicion. To most \u2014 Leanne Dempster of Hibs and Hearts owner Ann Budge especially \u2014 the issue is one of fairness. It's clear cut. The games should always have kicked off at the same time and they believe the SPFL have been duplicitous and deceitful. Loathe to be seen criticising the SPFL, SFA chief executive Stewart Regan chose his words carefully, while all but admitting the league had made a complete and utter hash of things. Hamilton's Jason Scotland (right) challenges Dundee United's Calum Morris (left) during the SPL match . 'For 99 per cent of the time, there are no issues,' he said. 'Broadcasting in football has been operating for 20-30 years with big money coming into the game. Usually it's no problem at all. 'There are times \u2014 and we have one right now \u2014 where the broadcaster has a requirement to show a match at a particular time on a particular day and that causes issues. 'It's important for the league to consult with all of the interested parties, particularly the clubs who are the connecting point with the fans. 'Obviously, you can't please everybody but consultation is the secret. Neil Doncaster (SPFL chief) has been challenged by a number of different parties and I think it's important he listens and tries to come up with a pragmatic solution.' Minutes after Regan spoke, the SPFL's solution arrived in the shape of an embarrassing U-turn. As they should have been from the outset, the final-day Championship games were all rearranged for Saturday May 2. With a 12.15pm kick-off, naturally. And after some cap doffing and bowing to the Sky paymasters. Most accept Doncaster is the paid hand of the most influential clubs in Scotland, with little real executive authority. His job is to act as a human shield for clubs and to put lipstick on a pig of a broadcasting deal. Yet the decision to put the Rangers fixture back heightened suspicions over both his competence and motives. In May 2013, the final game in Division Three for the Ibrox club \u2014 against Berwick Rangers \u2014 was shown live on television. The other four fixtures were immediately brought forward, too. A statement on the Rangers website confirmed the decision had been taken 'in the interests of fairness'. What changed between May 2013 and now? To those who believe the SPFL are hellbent on getting Rangers back into the top tier come what may, this was manna from heaven. 'It's a challenging time for the SPFL right now,' said Regan with a degree of understatement. 'I can see why fans are unhappy. 'Ultimately there's always a balance between the needs of the broadcasters and the needs of the clubs, the needs of the supporters and sponsors. 'When you're looking at a Scottish football landscape, where money is tight and a broadcaster is the biggest provider of income, that can't be ignored. I'm not saying it's right but they have to be heard.' The problem comes when paying customers believe the broadcasters are the only people being heard. St Mirren's Stephen Mallan (centre) is challenged by Ross County's Jackson Irvine (right) Scottish fans from across the UK are now routinely asked, at the drop of a hat, to change travel plans to facilitate Friday-night football and noon kick-offs on a Saturday or Sunday. Monday night games have also crept onto the schedules. And for what? Scottish viewers make up around nine per cent of Sky and BT Sport' s subscribers. Yet it now costs them more to cover two games between West Brom and Stoke than it does to fund an entire season of Scottish football. The BBC, meanwhile, pays Gary Lineker as much to present Match of the Day as they do for SPFL highlights and radio coverage. 'It's fair to say that the landscape we are in right now is challenging,' added Regan. 'When you look at the numbers that the Premier League delivered in England it blows everything out of the water. 'The Scottish football authorities \u2014 the league in particular \u2014 are fighting for what you would call the scraps from the table. 'I know that there is pressure being put on the BBC through a number of parties right now, including the Scottish Government, to try to see if there is any way to make an improvement in income that can be generated by further discussions. 'But, ultimately, the broadcaster will only pay market rate for the product they are buying. 'We are trying to get that market rate back up by collectively working on initiatives to improve our game, but it's not going to happen overnight.' The empty stands are a problem. The spectacle in the SPFL is often poor and does nothing to persuade Sky that Scottish football is worth paying out more cash. In a vicious circle, however, this attitude drives the crowds lower and lower. Many now speak openly, then, of Scottish football going cold turkey. Of subscriber boycotts or ending the abusive relationship with broadcasters altogether and streaming SPFL games online on a pay-per-view basis. Or having no coverage at all. When old hands of the Scottish game such as Sir Bob Kelly, Jim McLean and Jim Farry warned of the creeping dangers of live television they were dismissed as dinosaurs. Right now, they look like visionaries. Celtic fans sing during the win over Kilmarnock, which sees them three points clear at the top of the SPL .",

Julio 'Wemo' Acevedo, 46, was found guilty of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after driving away from the scene of an accident that instantly killed Nachman and Raizel Glauber in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The driver, who was convicted in February, is thought to have been traveling in his BMW at 70mph, twice the speed limit, when the incident occurred just after midnight on March 3, 2013. Julio Acevedo (left) 46, was given 25 years to life in prison on Monday after driving away from the scene of an accident that killed a young Hasidic Jewish couple and their unborn child . Acevedo was convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of 21-year-olds Nachman and Raizel Glauber (right). Nachman and Raizel Glaubers, who were 7 months pregnant at the time of the crash, were heading to the hospital in this Toyota Camry livery cab when they were killed . The car the Glaubers were riding in was T-boned by this BMW at an intersection in Williamsburg, Brooklyn . He repeated that the crash was an accident as he was sentenced on Monday and said that he was remorseful, according to CBS New York. The 21-year-old Glaubers, who were married in 2012, were not wearing seat belts when the Toyota Camry they were riding in was T-boned by Acevedo at an intersection. Acevedo did not get out to help the young family and a witness said that he looked inside their livery cab before leaving on foot. Doctors at Bellevue Hospital were able to deliver the 21-year-old Glauber's baby boy, but the child died the next day. Acevedo's criminally negligent homicide conviction stemmed from the death of the baby. The family's Orthodox Jewish community, which had thousands of members gather to mourn the couple, offered a $15,000 award for information leading to the arrest of Acevedo, who left the scene and could not be found in the days after the crash. He was eventually taken into custody four days after the accident, when he surrendered himself to police after arranging to meet them in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Acevedo has a history of felonies, including a 1987 murder conviction that was overturned in 1997 because of new evidence showing that he was under duress when he killed Kevin '50 Cent' Martin, who inspired the name of rapper Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson. He later accepted a plea deal combining a manslaughter charge in the same case with a charge for a robbery he committed 12 days after being released. There are also gun and drug convictions on Acevedo's rap sheet, and he was awaiting an April court date for drunk driving when he hit the Glaubers. Acevedo, pictured after his Pennsylvania arrest in 2013, has a long rap sheet including previous convictions for manslaughter as well as gun and drug offences . Acevedo, pictured after arrest, was said to be going 70mph, twice the speed limit, when he ran into the Glaubers . The judge at Monday's sentencing said that because of his criminal pas  Acevedo was receiving a harsher sentence than the normal 15 year maximum for manslaughter. The criminal told reporters after his hit-and-run arrest that his illegal speeding was because he was afraid of being shot by someone who pulled out a gun and said, 'Nothing is ever forgotten.' The alleged incident may have been connected to his  killing of  Martin, according to the\u00a0Daily Beast. The BMW driver said that he was not going 70mph and had not been drinking before the crash. The Glaubers' cab driver Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32 at the time, sustained minor industries but survived,\u00a0the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. Relatives of the Glaubers were emotional as the verdict came down on Monday. 'There are no words that can adequately express the pain and anguish that we have endured in the last two years,' Nachman's mother, Henny Glauber said.

The 33 year old from Brighton's life went rapidly downhill after he finished first in the seventh series of the Channel 4 show nine years ago. Despite being given \u00a3100,000 of prize money and releasing a successful autobiography, Pete is now broke and living off the charity of friends. Scroll down for video . Pete Bennett appeared on Jeremy Kyle today to reveal that he is now homeless . Speaking on the Jeremy Kyle show today, the star revealed that he doesn't have a roof over his head and spends each night sofa surfing. He believes that finding fame on Big Brother kick started a range of problems that led to a dependency on the Class B drug ketamine. He said:'I had all of that money and I didn't know what to do with it \u2013 I put it on the wrong things. 'The fame pushed me in a way that I didn't want to go.' Pete's entry picture for Big Brother . Pete continued: 'I first got into drugs 15 years ago, I've always been the last man standing at a party but then I became addicted to ketamine. 'I couldn\u2019t go out without doing it. It became a habit and I did it every day. 'I couldn't go anywhere without getting given stuff. I don\u2019t want to know how much I spent on it.' It is an issue that has also affected many of his friends - in the last nine years since becoming famous, seven of his friends have died from drug-related incidents. Pete's drug addiction wasn't his only problem though - he believes that his appearance on the reality show meant that he found it impossible to get a job or being taken seriously for his music after he left the house. He said: 'The work dried up pretty fast. No one would touch me with a barge pole because I was on Big Brother. 'When I left the house I was led down the garden path with a lot of things. 'I felt like I was not being allowed to do what I wanted - I was a puppet.' Pete Bennett leaves the Big Brother House as the winner during the final of Big Brother Seven on August 18, 2006 . Although Pete has had a tumultuous time since leaving the house, one area where he has made great strides is overcoming his Tourette's Syndrome. The star claims that when he was younger, he had one of the worst cases of the condition in Europe. On the show, he would involuntarily hit his throat, twitch and shout out swear words, particularly the word 'w*****s'. But during his appearance on Jeremy Kyle, Pete's behaviour was far more controlled. Although he had the occasional twitch and still appeared quite hyperactive, he held back from shouting out any unplanned words. Unfortunately, as well as he battle with drugs, Pete's personal life and career prospects have also been marred with difficulty over the last nine years. A week before he left the Big Brother house in August 2006, Pete started an ill-fate relationship with fellow contestant Nikki Grahame but it quickly fizzled out. A month later Nikki revealed that Pete had called time on the romance. Nikki Grahame and Pete arrive for the National Television Awards in 2006. The couple started a relationship after leaving the Big Brother \u00a0house . Pete at a signing of his book in November 2006 . Pete then started dating one of his good friends, Gemma Costin, better known as Cherry, who he'd had a secret crush on for three years. The pair continued to date for eight years before marrying in a fake ceremony at Glastonbury festival in 2011, before sealing the deal with an official ceremony on the reality show Four Weddings in early 2014. But last \u00a0September he revealed in a Facebook post that they were getting divorced after just six months of marriage. After years of running from his problems by getting high on drugs, Pete finally decided to seek proper help by getting in contact with a drugs counselor a few years ago. He said: 'You don't know you're out of control until it suddenly hits you. 'When I went to get proper help for my addiction, this drug worker started to ask me about loss and I talked to him about all of the friends I\u2019d had who died. 'I hadn\u2019t been dealing with it. I was dealing with it by taking Ketamine and not dealing with it. 'I had to deal with my friends deaths and that's what got me off the Ketamine.' Pete at the\u00a0opening night of Glastonbury last year . Since getting clean, Pete admits that he has relapsed but states that he is now back on track. He said: '\u00a0I took Ketamine again and I relapsed but I hated it, I didn\u2019t like being disassociated. 'I like being here now and being able to chat to people. I'm living my life now the best I can. 'I'm not Perfect Pete anymore, I\u2019m just Pete.' The star is now trying to get his life back together and is attempting to make his name as an actor. He said: 'I do wish I'd done things differently but I've got a plan. 'I\u2019ve got into acting, I'm doing loads of films and working my way up the ladder. 'My Tourette\u2019s has calmed down so I thought, why not give it a chance.\u00a0We have to start somewhere. 'I've got my eye on Hollywood.'",

The Brazilian was on hand to embarrass fellow countryman David Luiz as the former Chelsea defender endured a horrendous evening in Spain. Rik Sharma sorted the best from the rest during the Champions League clash at the Nou Camp... Barcelona . Marc-Andre ter Stegen 6.5: Called into action for the first time by Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the second half and dealt with the Swede\u2019s powerful drive well, before fielding an Ezequiel Lavezzi strike too. One of the quietest evenings he will have. Dani Alves 7.5: Wound back the years to give everyone a reminder of why he was considered the best right-back in the world. Dazzling stepovers then a wicked cross for Neymar to bury. David Luiz takes on Paris Saint-Germain ace Javier Pastore during their match at the Nou Camp . Gerard Pique 5: Had little to do but shanked a couple of clearances horribly, which is out of character for the defender. Was also robbed by Ibrahimovic, though it came to nothing. Suffering a minor dip after a few months in which he has been at his very best. Javier Mascherano 6: Pique was the player assigned to deal with Ibrahimovic and Mascherano was left with little else to do, in a quiet evening for Barcelona\u2019s defence. Javier Mascherano reacts during Barcelona's Champions League clash with PSG at the Nou Camp . Jordi Alba 6: Didn\u2019t bother rampaging forward like you often catch him doing in La Liga. In theory that was to take care of Edinson Cavani, but the striker was extremely quiet. Sergio Busquets 7: Helped to snuff out the threat of Zlatan Ibrahimovic when the forward dropped into his midfield zone. Started a few Barcelona attacks with his usual eye for a quick pass. Ivan Rakitic 7.5: Contributed to Barcelona\u2019s high pressing, caging PSG in their own final third. Physically fit enough to get back and help out in his own defensive quarters too. In games like these . Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic holds off opposition midfielder Pastore as the Catalan side breezed through . Andres Iniesta 9: Has not quite found his best rhythm under Luis Enrique but his amazing dribble to set up Neymar\u2019s goal was pure Iniesta. Substituted at half-time for Xavi. Lionel Messi 6.5: Stayed wide on the right for a long while, conserving energy. Given his efforts against Valencia at the weekend, and in general during an extremely busy month, he can be forgiven. When he contributed to the game, it was with his usual quality, and whipped a strike inches wide of the left post in stoppage time. Argentinean wizard Lionel Messi dances his way through the Barcelona defence as they cruise through . Luis Suarez 6.5: Extremely unselfish. The Uruguayan did a lot of running and although it didn\u2019t come to fruition on a personal level, he earned Neymar acres of space and Barcelona were rewarded. Huge applause when he was substituted. Neymar 9: Two clinical finishes here, and plenty of direct, dangerous running which makes him impossible to handle. Final ball when trying to set up his team-mates sometimes needs a bit more precision, but that will come. Brazilian Neymar grabbed himself two goals as the La Liga giants eased through to the next round . SUBS . Xavi Hernandez 6.5: The Camp Nou relishes every chance it gets to see this old legend, before he heads off into the sun at the end of the season. (By sun, read Qatar, although a deal has not been finalised). Sergi Roberto 6: A rare opportunity which was mainly useful for giving Sergio Busquets\u2019 legs a rest. Pedro Rodriguez 6: This could be one of his last appearances at the Camp Nou, but didn\u2019t have time to show off. PSG . Salvatore Sirigu 6: Could do nothing about the goals, but at least he had the perfect view of Barcelona\u2019s calculated, technically excellent display. Gregory van der Wiel 3.5: Lost Neymar for the second goal \u2013 the Brazilian was his man \u2013 and was made to look a fool by him and Iniesta on more than one occasion. Gregory van der Wiel does his best to hold off the tackle of Barcelona's Jordi Alba at the Nou Camp . Marquinhos 4.5: His centre-back partner was in the spotlight for the goals, but he wasn\u2019t even on the scene which was a crime in itself. Far from commanding \u2013 PSG would have looked a lot stronger had Thiago Silva been fit. David Luiz 5: It took less than three minutes for the Brazilian to end up in the book, after fouling Ivan Rakitic. Ten minutes later he was beaten for pace by Neymar, who broke the deadlock and killed the tie. Stepped up a gear in the second half \u2013 at least he cared. David Luiz puts his head in where it hurts as Psg take on Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Tuesday . Maxwell 6: Excellent defending prevented Messi from adding a third at the end. Given how little of the ball PSG had, it wasn\u2019t an evening for showing off his attacking talents. Marco Verratti 6: Fired wide when well placed on the edge of the box in the second half. Brought a bit of spice to proceedings, but it was far from sufficient for Laurent Blanc\u2019s side. Blaise Matuidi 6: Verratti and Luiz aside, looked like the only PSG player who really, truly cared. Put out a few fires, including a good tackle to halt a Messi surge, but that didn\u2019t help while the rest of the side were falling apart. Blaise Matuidi has all eyes on the ball as he comes up against Barcelona's Alba during their clash . Yohan Cabaye 4: The former Newcastle midfielder\u2019s presence on the pitch was barely noted. The game passed him by, so did Iniesta. Taken off after 66 minutes and deservedly so. Javier Pastore 3: Gave the ball away countless times in the first half. Looked on a different, albeit not necessarily better, wavelength than the other PSG players. Ruined one break in the second half with an awful through-ball, which flew straight to Ter Stegen. Pastore takes aim at Barcelona's goal as the Ligue 1 giants do their best to get back into the game . Edinson Cavani 4: Another sad night for the forward. Even before he was taken off, Barcelona\u2019s half-time substitute Xavi had already had more touches of the ball than he had enjoyed in the entire game. Totally out of the action. Zlatan Ibrahimovic 4.5: The most danger he caused Barcelona\u2019s defence was a stay arm that caught Mascherano square on the head. Had a point to prove to the jeering Barcelona fans but never looked like doing it. Former Barcelona striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic attempts to take the ball round Argentinean Mascherano . SUBS . Lucas Moura 6.5: Fired over the bar when well placed as the game neared its conclusion. But for an injury, would have started and could have caused Alves some problems with more time. Ezequiel Lavezzi 6.5: Added a bit of pace, in place of Cavani, which the team was missing up front. Adrien Rabiot 6: Maintained the status quo.",

It was the Saturday that saw Leicester City keep their survival chances alive by coming from behind to beat West Brom and Tim Sherwood claim a priceless victory for Aston Villa at his former club Tottenham. Yannick Bolasie scored three as Crystal Palace shoved Sunderland closer to the drop zone, while Hull City remain in danger following a 2-0 loss at Southampton. Arsenal kept up their impressive recent form with a 1-0 win over Burnley, while the matches between West Ham-Stoke City and Swansea City-Everton ended in 1-1 draws. GOALKEEPER . Brad Guzan 7.5 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) This could prove the key moment if Aston Villa are to preserve their Premier League status, as Tim Sherwood returned to White Hart Lane and beat the club who ditched him last summer. He'll be grateful to goalkeeper Brad Guzan, who made a number of important saves to keep the Spurs challenge at bay. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan celebrates after Aston Villa's vital 1-0 win at Tottenham on Saturday . DEFENCE . Leandro Bacuna 7.5 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) It was an afternoon for stout hearts in the Villa defence as they clung on to Christian Benteke's 35th-minute goal but nobody was found wanting. Bacuna was effective in dealing with the Tottenham threat down his side of the pitch and also set up the winning goal. Villa's Leandro Bacuna tacks a run by Tottenham's Danny Rose during their 1-0 win at White Hart Lane . Scott Dann 7 (Sunderland vs CRYSTAL PALACE) Few preidcted that Palace would be sitting comfortably in 11th place at this point of the season, but that's the situation after their impressive 4-1 win at beleaguered Sunderland. Yannick Bolasie may have stolen the headlines but it was a win build also on solid defence and Dann was their stand-out performer at the back. Scott Dann tries to block an effort from Sunderland's Steven Fletcher during Saturday's contest . Ron Vlaar 8 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) After Benteke's opening goal on 35 minutes, Villa had to soak up a lot of Tottenham pressure and their central defensive pairing of Vlaar and Nathan Baker was excellent. The Dutchman needed to draw on a good deal of his experience and he commanded the back line with aplomb. Ron Vlaar keeps a check on in-form Tottenham striker Harry Kane at White Hart Lane . Nacho Monreal 7 (Burnley vs ARSENAL) Arsenal have found a new resoluteness on their travels and this was much in evidence at Turf Moor as they came away with a narrow but well-deserved win over Burnley. Monreal was a big part of this, performing his duties well both at the back and going forward. Nacho Monreal controls the ball during Arsenal's 1-0 win at Burnley on Saturday . MIDFIELD . Fabian Delph 8 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) Delph has been a bright point in an otherwise disheartening season for Villa and he was one of their strongest performers again at Tottenham as he took control of the midfield battle. Indeed, the England international could have scored a second goal towards the end but one was enough for Sherwood's team. Fabian Delph turns away with the ball from Tottenham winger Andros Townsend . Aaron Ramsey 8.5 (Burnley vs ARSENAL) While the Gunners' resugrence may have come to late to stop Chelsea claiming the title, their form since the turn of the year has offered great encouragement. Ramsey is often at the core of this and his energetic performance at Burnley was rewarded with a 12th-minute winner that took Arsenal's record to 15 wins in 17 games. Aaron Ramsey celebrates with Hector Bellerin after scoring what proved to be Arsenal's winner at Burnley . Wilfried Zaha 7.5 (Sunderland vs CRYSTAL PALACE) 'Ruthless, unforgiving... Too fast, too powerful' - that was the verdict of Sportsmail's Craig Hope on Zaha as Palace ran riot at Sunderland. The winger was a constant menace for the home defence and helped improve Palace's record to 25 points from a possible 36 since Alan Pardew took charge. Wilfried Zaha gets past Sunderland's Steven Fletcher to set off on one of his marauding runs . FORWARDS . Yannick Bolasie 9 (Sunderland vs CRYSTAL PALACE) A moment of history for Bolasie as he became the first Palace player to score a hat-trick in the Premier League. His treble at the Stadium of Light came in an electric 11 minutes after the break and turned a slender away victory into a rout. His second was the best, a chip over Costel Pantilimon after he pounced to rob a dithering John O'Shea of the ball. Yannick Bolasie wheels away in celebration after completing his hat-trick for Palace against Sunderland . Christian Benteke 8.5 (Tottenham vs ASTON VILLA) Benteke's 11 goals this season have been vital in keeping their head above water in the Premier League relegation battle and he again popped up with the winner at Spurs. Benteke outjumped Fazio to reach a Bacuna cross and direct a header beyond Michel Vorm to settle the contest. Christian Benteke celebrates his winner for Aston Villa against Tottenham at White Hart Lane . Jamie Vardy 7.5 (West Brom vs LEICESTER) His stoppage time goal at The Hawthorns offered fresh hope that Leicester may pull off the Great Escape and came about through sheer force of will. Vardy robbed Gareth McAuley of possession on the halfway line and advanced beyond Joleon Lescott to score and complete Leicester's late comeback.

The Mudgeeraba Caravan Village is home to more than 100 people, and has been the site of a fatal house fire, stabbings, brawls, and continual violence. Queensland Police patrol the site daily due the extreme level of incidents, and ambulance officers will now only enter the caravan park, which lies just ten kilometres from the region's famous Glitter Strip, under police protection. The Mudgeeraba Caravan Village is home to more than 100 people, and has been the site of a fatal house fire, stabbings, brawls, and continual violence . Senior Sergeant Mark Anderson, from the Mudgeeraba Police Station, said that officers considered that caravan park 'safe' before midday, but that 'once residents start on the drugs or alcohol, the situation deteriorates'. 'We try and get children out of there as quickly as we can. It\u2019s easier for us to deal with \u00adincidents if there are no children around,' he told The Gold Coast Bulletin. The conditions of the caravan park has been labelled 'horrific' by authorities, with some of the sites, which include an old bus, tarpaulins, and run-down caravans, are left without running water. The owner of the caravan park, Bob Purcell, said that the discounted rent of between $90 and $200 he offered to residents attracted a certain type of person. \u2018If you have cheap rent you\u2019re going to get some sort of problem with those sort of people,' he told A Current Affair. Senior Sergeant Mark Anderson, from the Mudgeeraba Police Station said that police try to remove children . Residents of the caravan park have told of the horrific levels of violence in the Village . \u2018We\u2019ll get up to mischief here on occasions,' he said. In 2008, a man died in a caravan fire, and in 2010, a male resident of the caravan park was charged with the stabbing of another man at the Village, reported The Courier Mail. In March last year three residents, allegedly armed with knives and baseball bats, were hospitalised after a violent brawl broke out involving 20 men, reported The Gold Coast Bulletin. Residents of the caravan park said that one of the biggest problems in the park stemmed from drugs and alcohol abuse. One residents said that much of the violence had to do with 'who's paid and who hasn't paid'. \u2018There\u2019s blues all the time, and there\u2019s no security at all,' he said. Residents of the caravan park said that one of the biggest problems in the park stemmed from drugs and alcohol abuse . Police are called to the caravan park frequently, and called the conditions of the park 'horrific' The same man admitted he had padlocks on his gate and front door just to ward away potential conflicts. Christian volunteers from Transformations Ministries visit the caravan park regularly, and offer food supplies as well as counselling services to the residents. Program co-ordinator Mark Farrugia said that the volunteers tried to show unconditional love and that the ministry offered\u00a0drug and rehabilitation service. \u2018This place provides a next step from the street. It is providing roofs over people\u2019s heads,'\u00a0Mr Farrugia said. \u2018Where you find a low socio-economic area you find the issues of drugs and alcohol are involved, and particularly where the drug ice is involved it escalates people\u2019s erratic actions.",

The 29-year-old American - the most decorated Olympian in history with 22 medals, 18 of them golds - will compete at the Arena Pro Swim Series event in Mesa, Arizona, from April 15-18. Phelps was suspended by USA swimming following his drink-driving arrest in September when police caught him travelling at 84mph in a 45mph zone in Baltimore, Maryland. Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic medals, 18 golds, but was banned from swimming in September . Having served his six month suspension the American will return to the pool in Arizona next week . 'My suspension is finally up! Time to get back in the pool and race again! Looking forward to #mesa !!,' Phelps wrote on his official Twitter account. The Arizona meeting is the same one at which Phelps returned to last year after a 20-month retirement from competitive swimming. Phelps is still serving the 18 months of probation he received from a Baltimore District Court judge after he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in December. The drink-driving arrest was Phelps' second in 10 years, and he responded by seeking treatment for alcohol abuse at an in-patient centre in Arizona. Phelps has been training in Baltimore and performed will in an exhibition race last month . Phelps has since returned to Baltimore where he has been training with long-time coach Bob Bowman and he swam impressively in a March exhibition race. As part of his punishment from USA Swimming, Phelps was also removed from the US team for the FINA World Championships to be held in Russia this summer. But USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus said last month there was a chance Phelps could be restored to the team ahead of what would be his fourth Olympic Games at Rio in 2016.",

A disgraced Pennsylvania math teacher has been sentenced to 30 days in jail, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student and sending him X-rated photos. Erica Ann Ginneti, 35, a married mother of three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in December to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor. The former math and calculus teacher at Lower Moreland Township School District had been facing seven to 14 years in prison, but on Friday Judge Garrett Page sentenced her to 3-23 months, including the first 30 days in jail and the next 60 on house arrest. She also faces three years\u2019 probation, 100 hours of community service and will have to register as a sex offender for the next 25 years, according to The Intelligencer. Ginneti\u2019s jail terms begins April 10. In court Friday, Mrs Ginneti wept as she read a letter of apology in hopes of offering the victim 'closure for this nightmare.' Prosecutors said the boy had seen his grades drop in his senior year and has been struggling with social interactions. The former educator described for the court how she has reconciled with her family and embarked on a new career as a fitness instructor. In her time off, she volunteers at a church, reported Philadelphia Inquirer. Judge Garrett Page told Ginneti he was certain she would continue to turn her life around, but he reminded her that her ill-thought actions had had devastating consequences. 'One bad day because of sexual hunger has resulted in all this avalanche of harm,' Page stated. He also chastised her for sending her male student explicit photos and videos of herself, which he likened to \u2018dangling candy\u2019 in front of the boy. The judge later clarified that he does not think the defendant is a 'bad human being,' but stated she must be punished for her \u2018bad act.\u2019 Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym . Ginneti's attorney asked the judge to spare her jail time so she could care for her small children. She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January. According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym. A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the student met for coffee in Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in her car. She then allegedly dropped her paramour back at the coffee shop and told him not to tell anyone about the encounter. Authorities say the investigation began after they received a tip-off that students had been overheard discussing X-rated pictures showing a minor and Ginnetti doing 'sexual things.' When police questioned the 17-year-old boy, he came clean about the affair and Ginnetti then also confessed to having a relationship with the student, police said. Watch the full report on CBS Philly here. Two months after Ginnetti first met her 17-year-old victim at his prom in May 2013 they drove to an industrial park and had sex in her car . The 35-year-old, pictured above after her arrest in January 2014, will have to perform community service and register as a sex offender . \u2018I would say that she treated her relationship with this student as she would have treated a relationship with an adult with whom she was involved,\u2019 Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told The Mercury News in January. Police said they found several texts the lovers had exchanged discussing their July outing and one mentioning \u2018a used condom that had been left in Ginnetti\u2019s vehicle,\u2019 according to the criminal complaint. On the night of the alleged tryst, after he returned home, the student told police he got a text from Ginnetti asking him to \u2018do it again.\u2019 As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children, ages 8, 11 and 14. She also had to surrender her passport, and the authorities have been keeping track of her using a GPS device.

The NASUWT union said indiscipline is a \u2018significant problem\u2019, with teachers sworn at, kicked and punched. Last year, staff at eight schools refused to teach pupils who threw chairs, brought fireworks in and threatened to slit other children\u2019s throats. Teachers are suffering broken arms and severed fingers at the hands of violent pupils. A deputy headteacher fell and fractured her arm while trying to restrain a six-year-old boy with autism . Paul Nesbitt, NASUWT executive member for the West Midlands, said the union \u2018doesn\u2019t hesitate\u2019 to launch so-called \u2018refusal to teach\u2019 ballots. Mr Nesbitt, who is a member of the union\u2019s health and safety committee, told the NASUWT\u2019s annual conference in Cardiff: \u2018This year alone I have been personally involved in some refusal to teach, where at one school a six-year-old boy broke the arm of a deputy head teacher. \u2018It was difficult to go in and speak to four members of staff who actually cried and broke down and were in fear of their personal safety within the classroom. \u2018Most people say: \u2018A six-year-old?\u2019 But that six-year-old was able to break someone\u2019s arm. That\u2019s a concern.\u2019 The woman had fallen while trying to restrain the boy, who had autism and behavioural problems, at the primary school in Walsall, West Midlands. Mr Nesbitt cited another teacher whose finger was severed by a student at a pupil referral unit in Solihull, West Midlands, a few weeks ago. He said: \u2018We\u2019ve been contacted recently where a member had to be rushed off to the local QE (Queen Elizabeth Hospital) in Birmingham to have an emergency operation to reattach the top part of her finger because one of the students had kicked the door and caught her hand and took the top off the finger.\u2019 The revelations were made at teachers' union NASUWT\u2019s annual conference in Cardiff today (general secretary, Chris Keates, pictured) Mr Nesbitt pointed out that under the Health and Safety At Work Act 1974, employers must make sure as far as \u2018reasonably practical\u2019 that employees are protected. He said: \u2018At times, at some of the schools I visit, that is questionable. \u2018As a union, we accept that most schools and colleges, remain relatively safe and secure, but we are seeing the increase of numbers of incidents within school: a minority of pupils who continue to challenge authority and behave disruptively, using threatening behaviour, abusive language and sometimes physical violence towards our members.\u2019 He warned that some schools are \u2018continually reluctant\u2019 to impose sanctions such as exclusions because they do not want to inform their local authority or gain a \u2018bad reputation\u2019. Mr Nesbitt added: \u2018In a scenario recently when I looked at a school\u2019s behavioural system there were 1,200 behavioural issues that had been reported internally but only 12 had been reported to the authority. \u2018According to the authority, that school was deemed as a good, well behaved school but we know that\u2019s not the case.\u2019 Dan McCarthy, NASUWT\u2019s national executive member for the Eastern region, said a female teacher at a local primary school had been \u2018kicked repeatedly by a six-year-old\u2019. Later, the woman \u2018discovered she was pregnant and the child was now punching her in the stomach\u2019. She went on sick leave as a result. \u2018I was working in a department where a student stabbed another student in one of the classrooms,\u2019 he said. \u2018We actually had as a school a procedure for that. In that school there was a tannoy system. \u2018The tannoy system would talk about a Ford Escort, and depending on how certain numbers were said about that Ford Escort\u2019s lights being on, staff knew how to react in different ways. \u2018But I\u2019m asking you, in your school is there an emergency protocol? Is there a facility in your school to lock your school down if necessary?\u2019 Neil Lawrence, a teacher from Nottingham, told the conference that a Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) injured her back after a pupil pulled a chair from beneath her as a prank. Staff at eight schools refused to teach pupils who threw chairs, brought fireworks in and threatened to slit other children\u2019s throats, last year . He said: \u2018This NQT still hasn\u2019t returned to work. She\u2019s still in a lot of pain.\u2019 Jane Setchfield, an NASUWT executive member for Wales, said some schools are operating a sliding scale discipline policy. This means that \u2018a pupil verbally abusing a main scale teacher will have a minor sanction\u2019. She added: \u2018Verbal abuse to a head of department or even the headteacher may result in a more serious sanction or even exclusion.\u2019 NASUWT delegates yesterday passed a motion condemning an \u2018increasing blame culture\u2019 that attempts to hold individual teachers responsible for poor pupil behaviour.",

A policeman convicted of misconduct in a public office after having sex with women he met on duty was today labelled \u2018a disgrace\u2019 to the force. Adam Rushton took advantage of being a beat officer in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, to have sex with women, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The 37-year-old officer was found guilty of five counts of misconduct and another of breaching data protection rules by obtaining personal data. Rushton, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, denied ten counts of misconduct and two of breaching data protection laws while employed by police. He was acquitted on the remaining counts. Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 who had \u2018brought shame on himself, his colleagues\u2019 and the force. Giving evidence, Rushton, who has been with the force for ten years, conceded some of his actions were \u2018not very professional\u2019 but claimed it did not amount to criminal misbehaviour. During the trial, he said he never expected to end up in the dock after going to one woman's home and having oral sex. \u2018It's not very professional, I fully accept that, and that it's wrong,\u2019 Rushton told jurors. \u2018But no way whatsoever did I think I'd be standing here.\u2019 He was convicted over that offence, and of making a social visit to another victim, while on the clock. Rushton was also convicted of having sex with a different woman at her house. He was found guilty on two counts relating to another woman, whom he met outside work, on one occasion having sex with her while on another exchanging \u2018playful and flirty\u2019 text messages before going to her home. Beat officer: Rushton has been with Staffordshire Police (whose headquarters are pictured) for ten years . His conviction for breaching data rules was in relation to looking up information relating to a fifth victim. The offences all happened between 2008 and 2012. When first interviewed over the allegations in April 2013, he denied sleeping with all but one of the women, however later accepted he had sex with several others. However, he denied his actions were criminal misconduct. Rushton had an impressive professional record as a neighbourhood policing officer, with many letters of praise from senior officers. But Crown Prosecutor Duncan Bould said the constable's duties brought him into contact with \u2018vulnerable and frightened females, often in extreme circumstances\u2019 and he had \u2018sought to take advantage of those situations to have sexual activity of some kind with them\u2019. Criticism:\u00a0Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker (pictured) called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 after the verdicts . None of the women made any complaints to police about Rushton. He was conditionally bailed after the verdicts were read out and will be sentenced at the crown court on May 1. After the hearing, Mr Baker apologised to the police officer's victims on behalf of the force. He said: \u2018This was an astonishing breach of trust by an individual officer and he has badly let down vulnerable victims and their families. The public must be able to trust their police officers, and on this occasion they have been let down. \u2018We made the decision that Rushton should be prosecuted as a police officer, and hope this sends out a very strong message - no matter who you are, and what position you hold, if you commit crime you will be dealt with firmly and robustly.\u2019 He added that after the allegations came to light in 2013, the matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which carried out an investigation. Mr Baker said that, as a result, \u2018robust processes\u2019 were now in place to prevent such incidents happening. IPCC commissioner Kathryn Stone said Rushton had abused a position of trust and used his job \u2018in a calculated manner to satisfy his own sexual desires\u2019. Ms Stone added: \u2018The IPCC has previously expressed concern at the number of cases across England and Wales where officers have targeted vulnerable women for sex. 'And I hope that today's outcome reinforces a message that corrupt officers will be discovered and brought before the courts where appropriate.\u2019",

In a move hailed by Islamic groups, Mrs May said that police will have to record Islamophobic attacks as a separate category, just as anti-Semitic crimes are recorded separately. At present some forces, including London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, do record Islamophobic crimes as such. Other forces categorise them as hate crimes or specific offences such as assault or grievous bodily harm. Scroll down for video . Pledge: Home Secretary Theresa May said police will have to record Islamophobic attacks as a separate category . The new requirement will create the first accurate picture of the extent of Islamophobic hate crimes in Britain. Charities say there has been a steady rise of anti-Muslim hate crimes since 9/11. But after incidents such as the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby outside Woolwich barracks in 2013 and the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, there are spikes in incidents in the UK, say experts. Mrs May made her pledge in a speech on counter-extremism to the Foundation for Peace in London just before Parliament was dissolved. She told the conference: \u2018We will require police forces to record anti-Muslim crimes as well as anti-Semitic crimes.\u2019 On the same day, Mrs May answered a question from Labour MP Kate Green in Parliament, who asked what steps the Government was taking to record anti-Muslim hate crimes. Mrs May said: \u2018A Conservative government would require the police to be recording Muslim hate crime, anti-Muslim incidents, as well as anti-Semitic incidents.\u2019 The Home Office does not publish national statistics for Islamophobic offences. The move by Mrs May, pictured here with Prime Minister David Cameron, has been hailed by Islamic groups . But in 2013-14, police recorded 44,480 hate crimes, an increase of five per cent over the same period the previous year across England and Wales. The vast majority \u2013 37,484 \u2013 were race-hate crimes. Tell Mama, a Government-backed Islamic group, said that more than half of all the victims (54 per cent) of Islamophobic incidents are women, perhaps because they \u2018appear more Islamic\u2019, wearing the burka or headscarf. Tell Mama figures show that in the ten months after the Lee Rigby attack, a total of 734 incidents were reported to the organisation \u2013 an increase of 20 per cent on the same period the previous year. The most serious incident is believed to be the frenzied knife attack on Saudi Arabian student Nahid Almanea, 31, in Colchester, Essex, in June last year. Detectives believe she was attacked because she was wearing Islamic clothes. So far no one has been arrested for the murder. Mohammed Amin, a patron of Tell Mama, said of Mrs May\u2019s speech: \u2018This is a positive step forward.\u2019 The Muslim Council of Britain has also welcomed the proposal. Iqbal Sacranie, the group\u2019s former Secretary-General, said: \u2018This change will bring parity between Muslim and Jewish groups.\u2019",

Sterling's commitment to Liverpool is in doubt after he gave a televised interview on Wednesday explaining why he has chosen to put talks over a new deal on hold. As Sportsmail revealed on Thursday, Chelsea are interested in the 20-year-old and have been asked to be kept updated on his future. Arsenal are also keen on the England international. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has rejected a new \u00a3100,000-a-week deal with Liverpool . Jose Mourinho insists that he would sell any of his Chelsea players if they did not want to play for the club . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is adamant that Sterling will not be sold in the summer transfer window . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will play Sterling at Arsenal in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash despite the player admitting that he is 'flattered' by interest from the north London club. Rodgers insists Sterling is not for sale this summer at any price, despite his reluctance to sign an extension. But Mourinho said: 'I don't like players that don't want to play for me and my club. My opinion is every player has a price. 'It doesn't matter which player. If you ask me, for example, do I want Eden Hazard to leave Chelsea? No. If he wants to leave and doesn't want to work with me, doesn't want to play for Chelsea, does he have a price? I think he has. But I also understand the philosophy of managers and clubs who want to keep the players at any price. My philosophy is not better than that, it's just mine.' Mourinho and Chelsea are interested in Sterling and could make a move for him at the end of the season . Sterling will start against Arsenal  despite admitting it was 'quite flattering' to be linked with the Gunners . Mourinho watches Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Filipe Luis and Nemanja Matic (L-R) in training at Cobham on Friday . Rodgers has resisted the temptation to leave out Sterling on Saturday after a turbulent three days following his revelation of the reasons for stalling over a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract. Sterling's remarks about being flattered by Arsenal's interest have only added to suspicions that his representatives are trying to engineer a move to London. But Rodgers believes that Sterling will react 'very strongly' to the situation and has the right temperament to handle a game that Liverpool need to win to close a six-point gap on Arsenal in the race for a top-four finish. 'He will play,' said the Liverpool boss. 'If it was a different player I would maybe have something to think about. But with this kid, since he has come in, trained and worked with me, he has been phenomenal and I expect him to go there and perform at a high level. 'I think he is a strong character. He's a young boy, still learning, on and off the field, but I don't think there was anything derogatory to Liverpool. I know he loves the club and I expect him to perform at a high level.' Rodgers says he expects Sterling to 'perform at a high level' against Arsenal despite his contract wrangle . Sterling has attracted interest from clubs including Arsenal, Manchester City and Bayern Munich . Kolo Toure, pictured being challenged by Steven Gerrard, believes Sterling should remain at Anfield . Kolo Toure, meanwhile, has warned that leaving Anfield could see Sterling end up on the scrapheap at another club, in a similar way that occurred with Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair at Manchester City. The English pair, who used to play with Toure at City, played just nine Premier League games between them after moving to the Etihad. Toure told the Liverpool Echo: 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he would not be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. He needs to stay here. This is the best place for him.'",

The SNP leader insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament, even though she is not even standing for election to the Commons. And she vowed to use the influence of dozens of MPs to get her way for the next five years without voting down the government. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured today in Kilmarnock, insisted she would call the shots in the event of a hung parliament, even though she is not even standing for election to the Commons . Ms Sturgeon said that Mr Miliband will 'have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through' Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would act to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour government. The SNP have enjoyed a surge in popularity since September's referendum on independence, despite 55 per cent of people voting stay in the UK. A new opinion poll by TNS puts the SNP on 54 per cent, up two points on two weeks ago, with Labour down two points to 22 per cent. Labour now faces the prospect of near-wipeout north of the border, robbing Ed Miliband of his chances of an overall majority. However, Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would act to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour government. Both sides have ruled out a formal coalition, and yesterday Mr Miliband said he had 'made it clear we're not interested' in deals, such as a 'confidence and supply' arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget. But Ms Sturgeon insists that after polling day, Labour will be forced to do as she says. 'Ed Miliband can say what he wants right now, he's entitled to do so, but he can't deny reality,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'If there is a situation after the election where neither of the big parties has a majority they will have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to and compromise with others in order to get their policies through. 'Now, whether that's as part of a formal deal, or on an issue-by-issue basis it gives parties like the SNP enormous clout and enormous influence.' A new opinion poll by TNS puts the SNP on 54 per cent, up two points on two weeks ago, with Labour down two points to 22 per cent . Support for the SNP has soared since the independence referendum in September, when 55 per cent of people voted against leaving the UK . Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at the Arc Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees with local candidate Louise Baldock, said he had 'made it clear we're not interested' in deals, such as a 'confidence and supply' arrangement where the SNP would agree to back Labour on important votes such as the Budget . A briefing by Lord Mandelson's company suggests the SNP will be the real winners of the election . The SNP will emerge as the winners from the general election whatever happens on May 7, Peter Mandelson's firm has warned. Global Counsel, the consultancy chaired by the former Labour Cabinet minister, warns Labour will be pulled to the left if SNP calls the shots. 'Labour may be wary of the SNP, because it knows\u00a0an arrangement with the party could annoy some English voters, but it may have little choice if it is\u00a0to form the next government,' the company said in a pre-election briefing. Analyst Gregor Irwin says the SNP will have 'maximum\u00a0leverage' soon after the election and will seek to 'pull the Labour party to the left,\u00a0away from the centre ground of English politics'. 'This will include pushing Labour towards higher public spending,' he adds. The company has made clear that the document are the personal views of Mr Irwin, a former\u00a0chief economist to the foreign office. She insisted that she will lead any talks with the next UK government, despite the fact that she is not standing as an MP. Angus Robertson is currently the SNP leader in Westminster, while Alex Salmond \u2013 who is set to return to the Commons \u2013 had also been viewed as a potential powerbroker. Ms Sturgeon made clear that she will be in charge: 'I am the leader of the SNP and therefore if there are discussions to be had after the election, I will lead those. 'I am the leader of the SNP and people voting SNP know that and I don't think are under any illusions about that.' Polls continue to suggest that neither Labour or the Tories will get an overall majority, leaving them to rely on smaller parties to form a government. Ms Sturgeon said that Mr Miliband will 'have to reflect how people have voted and they will have to on a practical level be prepared to talk to others and compromise with others in order to get their policies through'. She added: 'Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act it is possible for other parties to change the direction of a government without bringing a government down. That gives enormous influence.' The SNP leader rejected the suggestion that her party was more austere than Labour, insisting 'every single penny' had been passed on from grants to the health service. Ms Sturgeon said: 'We are putting forward as part of our anti-austerity argument the fact we would vote for considerable increases in health spending across the UK to meet the terms of the Stevens Report and ensure as we go into the next decade the health service is properly equipped to face up to the challenges it will meet.' She added: 'As long as Westminster decisions affect Scotland it matters to the SNP and it matters to Scotland that those decisions are good decisions, to we have a vested interest in making sure the politics at Westminster is better politics.' Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said:\u00a0'When Ed Miliband's biggest union paymaster is saying that he will be forced to do deals with the SNP, it's no surprise that Nicola Sturgeon knows she will be pulling Ed Miliband's strings if he gets into Downing Street. 'Working people will pay the price for an Ed Miliband government that's propped up by the SNP \u2013 through more debt, more borrowing and more taxes.' Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has had to pull out of her party\u2019s housing policy campaign launch after losing her voice . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has had to pull out of her party\u2019s housing policy campaign launch after losing her voice. Ms Bennett - who had been due to set out her party\u2019s plans to control rents during a visit to a south London housing estate - was said to be \u201cresting\u201d ahead of her battle bus launch tomorrow. Earlier she dismissed suggestions that Labour had stole their thunder, dismissing their proposals as a \u201cwatered down\u201d version of what the Greens are offering. She told BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe need to move away from thinking of homes primarily as financial assets and go back to thinking they are safe places for people to live.\u201d The Greens would also abolish right to buy, she said, and build 500,000 social homes on brownfield sites over the course of the next parliament. The party would link a cap on annual rent increases to the consumer price index, as part of a package of measures to make the private rented sector fairer for tenants. It is also calling for a Living Rent Commission to investigate ways to bring rent levels down. Ms Bennett said: \u201cAt the moment, the private rental market is structured in a way that benefits landlords over tenants, and treats homes as investment vehicles. \u201cAs more people rent, rather than own, their homes, it is vital that we correct this imbalance. \u201cKeeping rent rises in line with inflation will reduce poverty and allow tenants a better standard of living. We also need to look in to all options for cutting rent. That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling for a Living Rent Commission to tackle our housing crisis.\u201d It is not the first time the Greens\u2019 campaign plans have gone awry - the party twice had to postpone a poster launch while earlier this year Ms Bennett suffered a \u201cbrain fade\u201d during a radio interview in which she struggled to explain her party\u2019s policies.",

A woman has been branded a 'menace to the community' after she posed as both a council warden and a church official to bluff her way into sheltered housing complexes to steal from vulnerable residents. Julie Walters, 49, has been jailed for two and a half years after she pretended to be a trusted official to dupe elderly victims out of cash. She was caught by police after she was spotted on CCTV loitering in the communal hall of a retirement property near to the Old Trafford football ground in Manchester before an 80-year-old man and an 81-year-old woman were fleeced in two separate attacks. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters of Withington, Manchester, hanging around outside the complex after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester\u2019s Minshull Street Crown Court. The court heard how the first victim, a man aged 81, was targeted at about midday on February 25 this year when he was walking back to his sheltered accommodation. He saw Walters get out of a taxi and she asked him for money, claiming she needed to pay the taxi and then go into town. Mistakenly thinking she was one of the wardens, he gave her about \u00a330 in cash. The next day she returned to the man\u2019s address, claiming she worked there, and needed to check his bathroom. After tricking her way inside, she stole his wallet and \u00a3100 in cash. Walters struck again on March 2 at the home of an 80-year-old man who lives at another retirement home. She falsely claimed she was from the church which convinced the man to let her inside. Walters then rifled through the kitchen, stealing his wallet containing between \u00a350 to \u00a360 in cash. Later that day and at the same retirement home, Walters targeted the home of an 81-year-old woman, claiming she was from 'the council' and needed to use the toilet. Once inside, she stole a \u00a35 note from the woman\u2019s handbag but was caught red-handed. When confronted she simply put the note on the coffee table and left. Walters was identified on the CCTV footage by a beat police officer and she was arrested on March 4. Investigations showed she had booked taxis to drop her off and then pick her up at times and locations matching those of the three burglaries. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters hanging around outside a complex, where she targeted two residents, after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester\u2019s Minshull Street Crown Court . After the case Detective Sergeant Rachel Smith of Greater Manchester Police said: \u201cWalters is devoid of conscience and scruples. \u201cShe is also extremely manipulative, not only in terms of tricking her way into the homes of vulnerable people but also targeting those she thinks are too frail or elderly to recognise her or give evidence in court. \u201cIn fact, in this case, one of the victims did feel he was too old to go to court but thankfully the woman who caught her red-handed positively picked her out of an identity parade and that, combined with the CCTV and mobile phone evidence we found, created an overwhelming case against Walters. \u201cI cannot overstate what a menace to the community Walters is but thanks to this excellent investigation, she is now starting a lengthy jail sentence and the streets are much safer with her behind bars. \u201cI would also like to commend the victims for giving their statements despite some reservations about their age. 'By doing so, they have not only helped effect justice for themselves but also saved other potential victims a great deal of heartache.\u201d",

Phylise Davis-Bowens, who attended Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, for their 'transformative leadership' program at the age of 37, launched a lawsuit after she alleged she was not allowed to try out for the 14 Karat Gold dancers. Mrs Davis-Bowens, a substitute public school teacher in Miami who married last Valentine's Day, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that she was discriminated against because of her weight and missed out on part of the academic experience. Phylise Davis-Bowens, 42, who attended Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is suing her former college because she was not allowed to try out for the\u00a014 Karat Gold dancers in 2009 . The\u00a014 Karat Gold dancers are regular performers at sporting events related to the Florida university . The student, who had been dancing since the age of 16, had wanted to join the dance troupe to use her performance work as part of her thesis in 2009. Band director Donovan Wells told her she could try out for the team if she lost 20lb, she said. Mrs Davis-Bowens went on to lose 16lb in one month in order to try out but was still denied an audition for the dance troupe. After around a year, she had lost a total of 60lb. She told Daily Mail Online: 'I wanted to join because of my talent but the coach said I didn't have the body type. But to me, I have two arms and two legs which is what I needed.' The weight discrimination is of particular importance to Mrs Davis-Bowens because she lost her sister at the age of 37 to a gastric bypass because she was obese and felt under pressure to quickly lose weight. The 42-year-old said she also has ongoing health issues from losing weight quickly. According to their Facebook page, the 14 Karat Gold dancers are made up of college students who perform alongside the\u00a0Marching Wildcats during college sporting events. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Monday, a university spokeswoman said: 'Bethune-Cookman University was made aware today that a complaint was filed. 'We are currently investigating this matter. B-CU is an equal opportunity institution and encourage all students to be actively involved in our campus extracurricular offerings.' Ms Davis-Bowens' lawyer, David Glasser, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that his client had brought the lawsuit to make a point about discrimination and was seeking unspecified damages in district court which can award more than $15,000. The 42-year-old graduated from the college in 2011 and went on to teach in the Miami-Dade public school district. She also claimed that the school did not allow her to attend the graduation ceremony and sent her diploma in the mail. The 42-year-old woman (left) said she lost 16lb in a month to try out for the dance troupe but was still denied an audition. She went on to lose 60lb in a year .

It closed in 1995 but is now set to have new life breathed into it after planning permission was granted to build 102 apartments in its place. Shattered doors, overturned bathtubs and crumbling floors dominate the Grade II listed St George's County Asylum where patients were restrained by means of 'the leather muff,' 'iron handcuffs' and 'restraint chair'. There are also reports of prevalent dysentery and syphilis. Scroll down for video . A mysterious past: The history of this 19th century asylum in the West Midlands saw patients being restrained by means of 'the leather muff,' 'iron handcuffs' and 'restraint chair'.

Suicide cages were erected in the stairwells after a female patient threw herself off the fourth floor and landed near the reception. It now lies in a terrible state, but building work is under way to transform the site into new homes. Property developer Shropshire Homes is beginning work on demolishing parts of the asylum beyond repair as part of a project to revamp the structure into 102 apartments. The apartments, the first of which are due to be occupied by early next year, will be priced between just under \u00a3100,000 and up to \u00a3300,000 for what company director Howard Thorne described as the 'penthouse apartments'. He said the parts of the asylum being demolished were 'structurally unsound' and that it was impossible for them to be preserved. St George's County Asylum, which was renamed St George\u2019s Hospital in 1937, was built at a time when Pauper Asylums were being constructed nationwide. It was designed by Joseph Potter in the style of a Georgian mansion at a cost of \u00a335,000. It was initially large enough to hold 120 patients but between 1879 and 1884 two extra wings were added. This included workshops and bakeries bringing capacity to just under 1,000. The lauded James Wilkes who was medical superintendent of the asylum from 1841 - 1855 said this about conditions before he arrived at his post. 'Previous to the year 1841, mechanical restraints were part of the system of treatment habitually employed. In need of a makeover: The asylum is now set to be transformed into 102 apartments.

Back in the day: Taken in 1992, this picture show what the asylum looked like before falling into disrepair. It closed three years later in 1995 . 'The means of restraint employed were the leather muff and wrist straps, iron handcuffs, long leather sleeves, hobbles for the legs, the restraint chair and various other devices. 'Many of them were employed day and night. In addition many of the patients were confined to their beds by means of straps passing through iron loops. 'The evil of this system was perpetuated by high windows protected by iron guards and strongly guarded fireplaces which gave a gloomy prison like aspect to the interior of the building. 'Above all it was evident that the system adopted had a natural and inevitable tendency to demoralise if not to brutalize the attendants.' The hospital shut its doors in 1995 and 145 long-term patients who still lived at the asylum were re-located into the surrounding community.

Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers because of restrictions that will squeeze profits. The company has also warned existing customers that the loyalty points they earn will be much lower from June 1. Financial experts believe other firms are likely to follow suit. Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers after the announcement of an EU cap limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments (file photo) The company scrapped the deal after the announcement last month of an EU cap \u2013 due to be introduced in October \u2013 limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments. Capital One said it made perks 'no longer sustainable'. Kevin Mountford, of price comparison website MoneySupermarket, told the Daily Telegraph: 'This is a classic case of regulators, in this case European, trying to act with the consumer in mind, only for the policy to come back to bite the very people it was supposed to help. 'Its new rules won't just hit cashback cards, all loyalty programmes are at risk because something will have to give when card companies are squeezed.' Last month, the European Parliament voted in favour of a cap at 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. The cap will apply to all purchases paid for with a card in the EU \u2013 either abroad or on the internet. Several credit card companies \u2013 including American Express, Barclaycard, and Santander \u2013 have millions of customers who earn hundreds of pounds or free flights if they clear their debts every month. Capital One, which pays card-holders 5p for every \u00a31 cleared, has written to customers warning that the amount they earn will be much lower from June 1. Last month, the European Parliament voted in favour of a cap at 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards (file photo) It said that fees paid by merchants such as shops and restaurants to accept cards are being reduced, and it was these fees which had funded their cashback. It said it would not be increasing fees or charges as a result of the changes. Rachel Springall, of financial information website Moneyfacts, said: 'The changes from Capital One could be the starting point for a change to reward schemes because of the new ruling on interchange fees. 'Instead of adding on card fees, providers will be looking at other ways to re-coup their costs and one of the ways to do this is to withdraw reward schemes or interest-free offers.\u00a0All it takes is for one provider to start the ball rolling before others do the same.'",

The Ukip leader said he would accept the result and rejected claims his party would become 'redundant' as a result. Mr Farage, appearing on a special Question Time-style programme filmed in Birmingham today, even claimed the party could enjoy an SNP-style surge in support in the wake of a vote to remain in the EU. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, speaking tonight on a special Question Time style programme broadcast on the BBC, insisted he would not give up trying to pull Britain out of the European Union even if voters rejected leaving in a referendum . The Ukip leader said he would accept the result, but rejected claims his party would become 'redundant' as a result . The Ukip leader's comments come after David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg faced a live-TV grilling over their plans for the next five years in power. All three leaders faced questions over Mr Cameron's proposed European referendum in 2017. The Prime Minister revealed that he would not go into any future Coalition which refused to grant the public a say on Britain's membership of the EU. Mr Miliband however batted off criticism from the audience to insist that he would not hold a referendum \u2013 insisting it was not in Britain's interests. Speaking tonight, Mr Farage claimed Britain could thrive outside the EU and vowed to push for a referendum before 2017. He said: 'The point about a referendum is we've had a variety of promises of referendums that have never been delivered. 'I want that referendum conducted on full, free and fair terms. And what I mean by that is that both sides must have the same spending limits. The broadcasters must have an Ombudsman to make sure there is a proper, even debate and we must - and we must define who is qualified to vote in this referendum and who isn't. 'And if it's a full, free and fair referendum I will accept the result. Would it make UKIP redundant? No, because just look at what's happened in Scotland. The Scots \u2013 the Scots rejected their independence referendum and yet the SNP have gone to remarkable heights since then.' The Ukip leader faced questions from a live audience for the show, hosted by the presenter Jo Cockburn, broadcast tonight . The show was broadcast after David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg faced a live-TV grilling over their plans for the next five years in power . Mr Farage's claim that Ukip could surge to similar levels of support to the SNP is likely to spark accusations of hubris. In the wake of last year's independence referendum in Scotland, the SNP has seen its support surge to 54 per cent \u2013 putting it on course, according to some analysts, to win all 59 seats north of the border. Ukip meanwhile trail badly behind both the Tories and Labour \u2013 currently languishing on between 10-15 per cent in the polls. Unlike the SNP, the party is expected to win no more than five seats on May 7 \u2013 with some pollsters predicting only the popular Douglas Carswell clinging onto his seat in Clacton, Essex. But Mr Farage insisted Ukip was on course to do well at the election and claimed the party's stance on border controls was backed by the vast majority of the country. He said: '77 per cent of British people want us to have proper border controls and reduced immigration levels, all right? I am pro immigration, but I'm pro controlled immigration.' During the earlier TV showdown Mr Cameron guaranteed that he would not go into government with any party that would not give the public an in-out referendum . Ed Miliband, appearing on the Question Time special tonight, insisted he would not give voters a say on Europe . Mr Farage said Ukip could save 'easily \u00a31bn a year' from NHS health tourism and returned to the controversial topic of foreign HIV sufferers receiving treatment on the NHS. He said: 'The issue I specifically raised was the issue that since 2012 anybody can come to Britain, not to live, but anybody can come to Britain and get HIV treatment on the National Health Service. 'Now it's interesting. I have here a letter from a 30 year old HIV positive man in London who says, why are the waiting rooms now full to overflowing? Why does it now take me three weeks to get an appointment? 'And he says to me, it is because since we opened the door in 2012 we're now incapable of providing HIV treatment for people legally living in Britain.' Mr Farage, facing tough questions from the studio audience, insisted Britain would not be damaged by leaving the EU. He said: 'We're not exiting Europe. Let's be very clear about that. I love Europe, it's a wonderful place. It's got different countries, different people, different languages, cultures, wines, cheeses, it's a great place. 'And providing it's democratic and not fighting each other it is, I think in many ways the richest, culturally the richest continent on Earth. 'However, what now masquerades as being Europe, what has hijacked the word Europe, is something called the European Union which has a flag, it has an anthem, it has a President \u2013 not that anyone can ever name who they are \u2013 and it is a political union that now makes nearly 75% of our laws, costs us a great deal of money and I think is wholly unnecessary, not just for Britain, but I feel that for the rest of Europe too.

The Scottish First Minister insisted she would block a Labour budget if Mr Miliband would not compromise with her . The Ukip leader also backtracked on comments praising the Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u2013 admitting that he was 'probably' a threat to the UK. 'Mr Putin who is clearly acting aggressively. I think he is a threat to us. I think there is also a threat from some of the extreme Islamic elements in the Middle East and it's back to the question about defence.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA new diet could more than halve a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to new research. Experts said the diet, known by the acronym MIND, could reduce the risk of the illness even if it not meticulously followed. The 'Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay' (MIND) diet includes at least three daily servings of wholegrains and salad \u00a0\u2013 along with an extra vegetable and a glass of wine. The new diet could more than halve a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, new research has found, and even has an effect when a person doesn't follow it meticulously . These 'brain-healthy foods' lowered the risk of Alzheimer's by 53 per cent in those who stuck to the diet rigidly. For those that followed it moderately well, it lowered the risk by about 35 per cent. Professor Martha Morris, a nutritional epidemiologist of the Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago,  said: 'One of the more exciting things about this is that people who adhered even moderately to the MIND diet had a reduction in their risk for Alzheimer's disease. 'I think that will motivate people.' Professor Morris and her colleagues developed the MIND diet based on years of past research about what foods and nutrients have good and bad effects on the functioning of the brain. This is the first study to relate the MIND diet to Alzheimer's disease. 'I was so very pleased to see the outcome we got from the new diet,' she said. The MIND diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, both of which have been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular conditions, like high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke. Wine is a 'healthy brain food', researchers said . 10 HEALTHY BRAIN FOODS: . Green leafy vegetables . Other vegetables . Nuts . Berries . Beans . Wholegrains . Fish . Poultry . Olive oil . Wine . 5 UNHEALTHY BRAIN FOODS: . Red meats . Butter and margarine . Cheese . Pastries and sweets . Fried or fast food . Some researchers have found that the two older diets provide protection against dementia as well. In the latest study, the MIND diet was compared with the two other diets. People with high adherence to the DASH and Mediterranean diets also had reductions in Alzheimer's disease\u2014 39 per cent with the DASH diet and 54 per cent with the Mediterranean diet. However, the diets had negligible benefits when people only adhered to it moderately. Professor Morris added that the MIND diet is also easier to follow than the Mediterranean diet, which calls for daily consumption of fish and three to four daily servings of fruits and vegetables. The MIND diet has 15 components, including 10 'brain-healthy food groups' \u2014 green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. It also has five unhealthy groups that comprise red meats, butter and stick margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets, and fried or fast food. The MIND diet includes at least three servings of wholegrains, a salad and one other vegetable every day \u2014 along with a glass of wine. It also involves snacking most days on nuts and eating beans every other day or so, poultry and berries at least twice a week and fish at least once a week. Dieters must limit eating the designated unhealthy foods, eating less than one tablespoon of butter a day and eating cheese, fried or fast food to less than once a week. Limiting these foods is essential to have a real shot at avoiding the devastating effects of Alzheimer's, according to the study. Berries are the only fruit specifically to make the MIND diet. Professor Morris said: 'Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,' adding that strawberries have also performed well in past studies of the effect of food on cognitive function. The diet suggests 10 brain-healthy foods including wholegrains, salad, vegetables, berries, nuts, beans, olive oil, poultry and fish . The MIND diet was not an intervention in this study, however; researchers looked at what people were already eating. Participants earned points if they ate brain-healthy foods frequently and avoided unhealthy foods. The one exception was that participants got one point if they said olive oil was the primary oil used in their homes. The study enlisted volunteers already participating in the ongoing Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), which began in 1997 among residents of Chicago-area retirement communities and senior public housing complexes. An optional 'food frequency questionnaire' was added from 2004 to February 2013, and the MIND diet study looked at results for 923 volunteers. The diet advises limiting butter to one tablespoon a day and limiting cheese, pastries, sweets and fast or friend food to once a week . A total of 144 cases of Alzheimer's disease developed in this group of people. The disease, which takes a devastating toll on cognitive function, is not unlike heart disease in that there appear to be 'many factors that play into who gets the disease,' including behavioral, environmental and genetic components, Professor Morris said. She continued: 'With late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with that older group of people, genetic risk factors are a small piece of the picture.' Past studies have yielded evidence that suggests what we eat may play a significant role in determining who gets the illness and who doesn't, Professor Morris added. When the researchers in the new study left out of analysis of participants who changed their diets somewhere along the line \u2014 say, on a doctor's orders after a stroke \u2014 they found there was a stronger link between the MIND diet and more favourable outcomes in terms of Alzheimer's disease. The diet's developer said blueberries are 'one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain' He said: 'That probably means that people who eat this diet consistently over the years get the best protection.' In other words, it looks like the longer a person eats the MIND diet, the less risk that person will have of developing Alzheimer's, Professor Morris said. As is the case with many health-related habits, including physical exercise, she said, 'You'll be healthier if you've been doing the right thing for a long time.' She added that the study did not establish a cause and effect relationship between the MIND diet and a lowered risk of Alzheimer's. Other studies on different populations would need to be carried out to do this, she said. The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging.",

Chelsea have made discreet overtures about Sterling, despite Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insisting on Thursday that his 20-year-old striker is going nowhere this summer. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week by giving an interview in which he claimed he is not motivated by money in stalling over a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is \u2018quite flattered\u2019 by interest from Arsenal. It has\u00a0led to suspicions that Sterling, who was raised in London and came through the youth system at QPR, is agitating for a return to the capital. Premier League leaders Chelsea are poised to join the battle for Liverpool wideman Raheem Sterling . However, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists the 20-year-old star is 'going nowhere' this summer . Sterling has claimed he is not motivated by money in stalling over a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract . Now Chelsea want to be kept informed about the forward\u2019s future as they join the hunt with Arsenal and Manchester City. But Rodgers said: \u2018He\u2019s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he\u2019s not going anywhere in the summer. I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the\u00a0superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn\u2019t come into it. If the club doesn\u2019t want to sell, it won\u2019t sell, it\u2019s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. \u2018Whatever player \u2014 Raheem or anybody \u2014 it would always be on the terms of the club. \u2018He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re overly concerned about. I\u2019m confident that at the end of the season we\u2019ll find the solution.\u2019 Sterling shares a joke with Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge during Liverpool's training session on Thursday . City and Chelsea have the money to lure Sterling should he be allowed to leave Anfield. Sportsmail understands Arsenal\u2019s interest is also serious. Doubts over Arsenal\u2019s ability to fund a move for Sterling have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him. In addition to the English trio, Sterling is also attracting interest from Europe \u2014 with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich monitoring developments. However, Rodgers reminded Sterling that it was Liverpool who made him the player he is today, saying he should be \u2018honoured\u2019 to represent the club. He refused to say whether the player will face disciplinary action after admitting the club had been caught off guard by the interview. Rodgers reminded England international Sterling it is Liverpool who have made him the player he is today . \u2018There was no permission by the club, it was something that surprised us all,\u2019 added Rodgers. \u2018It\u2019s part of the modern game. People who look after players and represent them have different ways of working. I\u2019ve seen that over the years. \u2018The last time we sat down it was the intention of the player and his representatives, and also the club, to put (contract talks) on hold. Obviously, Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that and hopefully now the focus will be on the football. \u2018He\u2019s a young player who is still learning and developing on and off the field. Sometimes you make mistakes as a youngster. \u2018Our relationship is strong, which is important. He knows I\u2019m working in the best interests of the club and for him.\u2019",

The niece of Gypsy Weddings star Paddy Doherty has been jailed for two years after she and an accomplice preyed on elderly people in their homes in 'cruel and heinous raids'. Chantelle Doherty, 21, of Prestwich, Greater Manchester, was involved in a raid on the home of a 92-year-old man in which she and another man bluffed their way in and stole several bottles of whisky, a decanter and a phone. Her friend Martin Lawrence, 27, also targeted a man aged 99 claiming he owed him money for non existing paving work. The incidents occurred after Doherty was freed from jail having been in prison for 16 months for leading a gypsy girl gang which carried out a string of vicious robberies. Doherty has now been jailed for two years after pleading guilty to burglary and fraud. Lawrence, of no fixed address, was jailed for five years after he pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary, three counts of fraud and one count each of robbery and attempted theft. Police said the offending began on November 9, 2013, when Lawrence and another man went to the home of the 99-year old man in Salford claiming to work for a paving company and asked the man if he wanted any work doing. He told them he did not but over the next few days they returned and called the victim on several occasions and persuaded him to hand over a large amount of money. A few days later Lawrence returned asking for more money but the man refused. Lawrence asked him for a drink and when the man went to make him one Lawrence went upstairs, where the man found him rooting through his drawers and told him to leave. He later found his wallet had been stolen and rang the police. Lawrence also returned in February and March 2014 asking to do more work on the driveway, but the man refused and called the police. Later on December 3 Lawrence went to the home of a 92-year-old man in Salford, pretending to be a charity collector. Doherty (pictured left) has been jailed for two years and accomplice Martin Lawrence (right) for five years . The man donated \u00a35 to what he believed to be a good cause, but while Lawrence was there he stole \u00a3130 from the man's wallet and his credit card. On December 9 Lawrence approached a 54-year-old man in his garden at his home falsely claiming to be from the police and asked the man if they could go into his house to talk about a recent crime. The man became suspicious and asked to see his ID, which is when Lawrence showed the stolen credit card. The man asked Lawrence to leave and there was a struggle between the pair before Lawrence stole his wallet which contained a debit card and Tesco mobile top up card, and made off. A short time after this incident, Lawrence and Doherty went into a pub in Pendlebury, and ordered around \u00a370 worth of food and drinks. They left the stolen debit card as payment but this was declined, so they told staff they would return to their hotel room next door to get another card, but they never came back. As they left, Lawrence was carrying a bottle of Amigo beer. Doherty is the niece of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celebrity Big Brother star Paddy Doherty (pictured) The pair then went to the home of the 92-year-old victim from a few days previously and persuaded him to let them in, where they stole several bottles of whisky, a decanter, phone and replaced his credit card with the stolen Tesco mobile top up card. The next day a relative of the man went to visit him and noticed a bottle of Amigo beer in the living room. DNA from the bottle was later matched to Lawrence. At an earlier hearing Doherty was said to have had no formal education and was unable to read and write and her role in the community is a 'particular role handed down to females in her position.' She was previously jailed aged 18 when she led a five-strong ladette mob which ambushed and bullied youngsters in the street and robbed them of valuables. During one incident Doherty - whose 52-year old uncle won the 2011 reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother - head butted a young boy, forced a fizzy drink down another terrified boy's throat  and poured alcohol over another. In one of the five hold ups across Salford, Greater Manchester, a girl of eight was forcibly pushed up a road on her bicyle and left crying hysterically after being robbed of her mobile phone. Another young girl was told 'if you call the police, we'll kill you, we're Gypsies,' before she was robbed of her Blackberry. Doherty, the eldest of the gang, was said to have been the most aggressive of the girls - even kicking out at a police officer as she was arrested. At today's court hearing she was said to be thoroughly ashamed and felt 'she's brought shame on her family, her community.' PC Michelle Ingham of Greater Manchester Police said: 'It is difficult to convey the devastating impact these cruel acts have had on these two victims. 'Lawrence repeatedly targeted two vulnerable elderly men in the sanctity of their own homes, a place where they should feel safe and where they and their families had worked hard to ensure these two men could still enjoy a high level of independence in their old age. 'As a direct result of what happened here, one of these men has had to move out of his family home, where until this point he had lived happily, and into residential care, which is simply heart-wrenching for both him and his family. 'I hope that today's sentencing acts as a warning to others who may think they can get away with targeting more vulnerable members in our society - this sort of heinous crime is one that we take extremely seriously and we will do everything in our power to trace those responsible and put them behind bars for their actions.'",

McLean told Rolling Stone that it was time to part with the manuscript. \"I'm going to be 70 this year,\" the singer and songwriter said in February. \"I have two children and a wife, and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct. I want to get the best deal that I can for them. It's time.\" Over the years, \"American Pie\" has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon. McLean has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of Buddy Holly, but after that, it's all been conjecture -- which hasn't stopped a marching band's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute, 33-second opus. Is the jester Bob Dylan? The football game Vietnam? The \"girl who sang the blues\" Janis Joplin? (One thing's certain: Buddy Holly's plane was NOT named \"American Pie.\") \"Over the years I've dealt with all these stupid questions of 'Who's that?' and 'Who's that?' \" McLean said. \"These are things I never had in my head for a second when I wrote the song. I was trying to capture something very ephemeral and I did, but it took a long time.\" The song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status. The song hit No. 1 in early 1972, despite its length. (The 45-rpm single split the song in half on its A and B sides.) The draft that was auctioned is 16 pages: 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, according to Christie's. It includes lines that didn't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing, McLean said. The record for a popular music manuscript is held by Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" which sold for $2 million in June. Opinion: What's so great about 'American Pie'?",

Police say Robert (Bob) Bates, 73,  thought he pulled out his Taser during an arrest, but instead shot the suspect, who later died at a local hospital. The shooting happened after an apparent drug and gun selling operation by the Tulsa Violent Crimes task force  Thursday. Bates, a member of the task force, was part of a group of deputies trying to arrest Eric Courtney Harris, 44, in the parking lot of a Dollar General store. Police say Harris, a convicted felon, sold undercover officers a pistol. When confronted by an arrest team, he fled the scene on foot and police say they \"observed him reaching for his waistband area ...causing concern for the deputies safety.\" After a brief pursuit, police say Harris was forced to the ground, where he continued to resist arrest and \"refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband.\" It was during this portion of the arrest that police say \"the reserve deputy was attempting to use less lethal force, believing he was utilizing a Taser, when he inadvertently discharged his service weapon, firing one round which struck Harris.\" Harris died at a local hospital and his cause of death is under investigation. Police say Harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of Phencyclidine, a street drug commonly known as PCP.

The hype surrounding McIlroy's attempt to join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods in winning all four major titles has been building since the night before his Open victory at Hoylake last July. And although the return of Woods to competitive action after two months on the sidelines has taken some of the spotlight off McIlroy, the world No 1 is anxious to let his clubs do the talking. Rory McIlroy insists he has arrived at Augusta ready to mount a serious challenge on the Masters . The world No 1 shields himself from the rain as he plays a shot during a practice round . 'I said in the middle of last week, 'If Augusta was to start tomorrow, I'd be okay. I'm ready,'' McIlroy said on Tuesday. 'I think that's a good indication of where I am with my game. I've been ready for this thing to start for a week already so just trying to keep my game where it is and do some quality work, not overdo it. 'Just do the right amount so that when I got here yesterday for the first time, I was ready to play and just needed to go see the golf course. I wasn't working on anything in my game, my swing. Wasn't thinking about technique at all. Just all about hitting the shots I need to and thinking about how to manage my game and get it around here for the next four days. 'Results-wise, the last three tournaments haven't been what I've wanted. I still feel like there's plenty of positives to take from them, especially Doral and Bay Hill, I felt like I played pretty good there. A couple silly mistakes here and there, but for the most part I felt like I got what I needed out of them. 'But the last two weeks have been great. I've just practised at home in Florida and made another trip up here a couple of Fridays ago. 'I just really felt like spending a couple of weeks away from this (media attention), I guess, and just preparing at home and in private and not really having everything critiqued and analysed and over-analysed. I just wanted to get away from it all, and I feel like it's been a good thing.' All eyes have been on Tiger Woods' latest comeback, which could take the pressure off of McIlroy . The Northern Irishman speaks to Wood's girlfriend Lindsey Vonn and his children during practice . McIlroy followed Woods into the media centre at Augusta National and admitted the presence of the 14-time major winner - who was relaxed and jovial with the press - could work in his favour. 'A little bit, I guess,' the 25-year-old added. 'It is such a big story, Tiger coming back at the Masters after a bit of a lengthy period where he has not been around. But still I'm just here to play golf and you guys can write the stories, I won't read them and we'll move on.' McIlroy has recorded just one top-10 finish in six previous appearances at Augusta - last year's tie for eighth - although he did take a four-shot lead into the final round in 2011 before collapsing to a closing 80. He admits he will have to play the par fives better to have a chance of slipping on a green jacket on Sunday, covering them in level par last year compared to eight under by champion Bubba Watson, who finished eight shots ahead. McIlroy led the field heading into the final day of the 2011 Masters before suffering a dramatic meltdown . McIlroy plays a shot from the azaleas as he recorded his best finish of eighth in last year's tournament . But he also believes Augusta National suits his game if he can take advantage of having a nine iron in his hands for second shots to holes like the 13th and 15th. 'I think I've developed a game where I can compete at pretty much any golf course now. That might not have been the case two or three years ago,' McIlroy added. 'But if you're looking at the courses, Augusta's the one that should set up the best for me just with my ball flight and being comfortable off the tee here, especially being able to turn the ball over from right to left. 'If I can play the way I know I can around here and just have a good week on the greens, then there's no reason why I shouldn't have a good chance.'",

The whales, which are in fact a species of dolphin, were found washed up along a 6-mile (10km) stretch of the Pacific coast of Hokato, around 60 miles (100km) north of Tokyo. Although officials are still investigating the cause of the strandings, they triggered rumours on social media of an impending earthquake. Scroll down for video . More than 160 melon-headed whales washed onto two beaches at Hokota city, north-east of Tokyo . The fears appeared to be based on the appearance of 50 melon-headed whales six days before the devastating undersea earthquake in 2011 that caused a tsunami and left 19,000 people dead. However, experts have dismissed the claims as being 'unscientific'. For centuries there have been accounts of animals behaving bizarrely before earthquakes. Now scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short-term seismic forecasting. They found that animals in Peru - such as pumas and razor-billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event. Researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions. Led by Dr Rachel Grant of Anglia Ruskin University, experts used data gathered from a series of motion-triggered cameras located in the Yanachaga National Park in Peru. The research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 Contamana earthquake that struck the region in 2011. On a typical day, the cameras would record between five and 15 animal sightings. However, within the two-day period in the run-up to the earthquake, they recorded five or fewer sightings. Instead they believe the melon-headed whales may have suffered a parasitic infection. Others believe the sandy shoals around Hokato city may have also made the animal's sonar ineffective. Toshiaki Kishiro, head of Cetacean Resources at Japan's National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries, said while it was possible the whales frightened by disturbances in the Earth's electromagnetic field caused by movement in the tectonic plates - there were was no firm evidence of this. Speaking to the Telegraph he said: 'This area of Japan has had many similar cases of beachings in the past, and especially of this species, so we are trying to find out why it happens.' He added that the animals, which measure two to three metres in length, could have been trying to avoid predators like killer whales and come too close to the shore. However, despite attempts to reassure the public, social media sites like Twitter have been ablaze with rumours of an impending earthquake. One Twitter user wrote: 'Is the next one coming? Be ready for a quake.' The whales first began to appear on the beach last week but officials said they had discovered eight more bodies today. Local residents had rushed to the beaches with buckets and towels in an attempt to help keep the marine mammals alive. Scientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of Hokota city . Local resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon-headed whales alive on the beaches . Officials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon-headed whales after they stranded . However, almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean. The strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of Japan is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity. Around 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in New Zealand just two days before a large earthquake hit Christchurch in 2011. The 2004 Boxing Day earthquake in the Indian Ocean that also triggered a devastating tsunami also saw 170 whales stranded on beaches in Australia and New Zealand in the days before. Those whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the Japan Coast Guard to return them to the ocean . Japan Coast Guard personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the sea . The whales were stranded on two beaches close to Hokota city around 60 miles north of Tokyo . According to the US Geological Survey, which monitors tremors around the world, there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles (252km) off the coast of Namie, Japan. Quakes of this size are relatively common along the fault line. However, researchers have found it is possible detect tiny pulses in the Earth's magnetic field in the areas around the epicentre of earthquakes in the weeks before they occur. Researchers at San Jose State University have been developing new techniques to use these pulses to predict earthquakes using highly sensitive magnetometres. However, it is not know if whales have the ability to detect such tiny fluctuations. Tadasu Yamada, a senior researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said investigations were still ongoing into what caused the whales to strand in Hokato. He told public broadcaster NHK: 'We don't see any immediate signs of diseases on their bodies, such as cancer. 'We want to figure out what killed these animals.' Residents struggled to return the whales to the sea after the mammals became exhausted in the shallow water . Once stranded, the animals are vulnerable to dehydration and sunburn until rescuers can use the high tide to move their massive weight back into deeper water. Efforts to save the dolphins stood in marked contrast to the global view of Japan and its relationship with cetaceans. Despite international opprobrium, Japan hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast, and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the Antarctic Ocean, where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling. It has never made a secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed. A United Nations court ruled last year that the Antarctic hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as research, prompting Tokyo to suspend operations, but it vowed to redesign the programme to make it more scientific. The International Whaling Commission's (IWC) panel of experts said today that it opposed Japan's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme, saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nSKYFARING . by Mark Vanhoenacker . (Chatto & Windus \u00a316.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker\u2019s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our \u2018historic relationship with aviation\u2019. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights \u2014 exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia\u2019s great blue heron as \u2018the 747 of the swamp\u2019 and notes how this would delight the aircraft\u2019s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more \u2018a place\u2019 than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the \u2018frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better \u2014 everything looks better \u2014 when your feet are warm\u2019. He writes elegantly about his pilot\u2019s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth\u2019s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And \u2018meet\u2019 really means \u2018meet\u2019: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, \u2018our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.\u2019 Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there\u2019s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as \u2018Klingons\u2019. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as \u2018the heavy\u2019, one acting as \u2018heavy out\u2019, the other as \u2018heavy home\u2019. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker\u2019s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region\u2019s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city\u2019s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker\u2019s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics\u2019 singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls.",

The woman picked up the 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, whose face and neck are covered in dark, self-administered tattoos, some with neo-Nazi symbolism. The woman didn't know he was armed with a knife and had almost $500, the report by Volusia County Beach Safety officers said. Scroll down for video . Would you slow down for this man? Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, managed to hitch a ride from a woman to Florida after his motorbike broke down, police said on Wednesday. Among his self-administered tattoos are the word 'brotherhood' on his neck and the number '88' on his left cheek which is linked to neo-Nazis . Stancil pictured with his mother Debbie at his graduation. She said he is 'rattled and confused and needs mental help'. The mother also claimed that the victim had\u00a0made sexually laced comments to her son . The driver was headed to Key West, Florida, but dropped Stancil off in Daytona Beach, where he was found sleeping on the beach on Tuesday morning. When officers approached him, he pulled the knife but dropped it when an officer drew his gun. He was arrested without incident, the police report said. Stancil is awaiting extradition back to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane, a print shop director at Wayne Community College. On Tuesday, he appeared relaxed in the courtroom and, despite the judge advising him he had the right to remain silent, he admitted to the killing,\u00a0WRAL reported. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth', according to the station. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Lane was gay, and authorities said they are investigating a possible hate crime.\u00a0They haven't released a motive for the shooting, but Stancil was dismissed from a work study program at the print shop last month. An extradition hearing was scheduled for Wednesday to send him back to North Carolina to face a charge of open murder. The police report said Stancil voluntarily gave police a statement, which authorities did not release. During his first court appearance on Tuesday in Daytona Beach, Florida, Stancil indicated he killed Lane because his former supervisor molested a relative. Nothing in police records substantiated the allegations. The suspect's mother, Debbie Stancil, said she knows the relative was not sexually abused by Lane, as Kenneth Stancil claimed in court, because the relative and Lane had never met. She believes Kenneth Stancil is making the accusations because he is 'rattled and confused'. Stancil, left, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane (pictured) 'He just snapped. That is not my son,' Debbie Stancil, said. 'He's probably out of his mind. I think he needs mental help.' Debbie Stancil said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son. 'He was verbally inappropriate with Morgan at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' Lane's brother and sister declined to comment. College spokeswoman Tara Humphries said she did not know whether any complaints had been lodged against Lane. Lane and Stancil started working together in August. Stancil was dismissed in early March. He had been enrolled in a three-semester welding course. Lane and Stancil were linked - whether they knew it or not - by the suicides of people very close to them. Lane's partner of 12 years killed himself last year. Stancil's mother says her son never recovered after finding his father in the backyard after he had killed himself in 2009. Stancil gave himself a facial tattoo last weekend that included the number '88' on his left cheek. Experts who track hate groups said the number is a neo-Nazi code for praising Adolf Hitler. Neo-Nazis have often been accused of attacking gays, said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Police have not said whether Stancil held white supremacist beliefs or what hate crime they are investigating. Stancil's mother said the tattoo marked a wannabe rather than someone with neo-Nazi beliefs. Stancil, pictured in court on Tuesday, is awaiting extradition back to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane, a print shop director at Wayne Community College .",

Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to obesity - which she says leaves her so tired that she falls asleep unexpectedly. The 21-year-old, who put on 13 stone in four years by eating through 'boredom', has not worked for five years because she says she would be a 'danger' in the workplace. Pressure group the Taxpayers' Alliance has now warned that the benefit system should not become a 'comfort blanket' and that people should 'get themselves in shape' to work. Scroll down for video . Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson (left and right) claims \u00a318,000 in benefits because she suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to excessive weight - which leaves her so tired that she can't stay awake . Ms Coulson told MailOnline: 'I can't work because of my condition. If I was sat in an office, I would just fall asleep and the manager will end up sacking me. 'It's not just that, but I could make something go wrong, couldn't I? By falling asleep and making a mistake. Who knows what buttons I would press or what would happen? It wouldn't be fair on my colleagues.' Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she needs a state-funded support worker to write her meal plans. Instead, she continues to claim \u00a318,712 a year in benefits - the equivalent of a \u00a322,000 taxable salary - which is more than a nurse's starting wage and the same pay as a newly-qualified teacher. She added: 'I would love to have a job, I didn't chose to be like this. But I can't. I'm too dangerous. I can't do anything if I'm falling asleep the whole time.' Ms Coulson, who lives alone in New Milton, Hampshire, said she has always battled with her weight. However, her weight spiralled out of control after she left home four years ago. Unable to get a job due to being signed off with depression, the young woman started eating up to ten packs of crisps per day because she was 'bored'. She would also have an evening takeaway - and had soon put on 13 stone. Ms Coulson, pictured with her mother Lynda, 50, says she would like to work if she were able to do so . Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she can only do that with a state-funded support worker to help her write meal plans . She said: 'I developed depression and that just made me eat more. I would have takeaways most nights. I ate a lot, including chocolate and crisps. It was a way of coping.' Sleep apnoea is a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, which interrupts normal breathing and can stop someone getting a decent night's sleep. Ms Coulson, who is 5ft 6in, claims the condition leaves her so tired that she cannot travel to work, incase she drifts off to sleep and misses her bus stop. She also says she is not allowed to drive incase she nods off at the wheel. Rochelle Coulson is entitled to a raft of benefits every month which means she has not had to work for five years. Every month she is entitled to: . Total: \u00a318, 712 . The 21-year-old is supposed to use a Continuous Positive Air Pressure machine (CPAP) to help her sleep during the night. But she decided not to use it because she claims she cannot travel to the doctors for a check-up. She has also been offered\u00a0half-price gym membership by the NHS to help her lose weight - but says she cannot use it because it is too painful to walk. Despite this, Ms Coulson says the NHS could be doing a lot more to help her. She said: 'Yes I do feel there is more out there to help me and the NHS could have done better. 'They haven't done enough to help me tackle my weight. It would be nice to have a check-up each week, or month, when me and the doctor sit down and write a meal plan. Or they could try and get me a support worker. 'I am supposed to have a CPAP machine to help but I do not use it because I can't get back to hospital for a check-up. 'I can't go to hospital because I can't go on public transport as I will fall asleep and my mum can't always be there with me. I can't drive either because of my condition.' Ms Coulson said she started applying for jobs when she first finished college at the age of 18. But she was soon diagnosed with depression and told she was not capable of working. In December 2012, she was then diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Now, she claims she can drop off to sleep unexpectedly for up to six hours per day, meaning she relies on repeat sick notes to claim her state handouts. But in June last year, Ms Coulson was struck off from a GP surgery when her mother Lynda, 50, asked for a three-month note which the doctor refused. When the doctor offered to give her a one-month note instead, the pair were banned for being 'verbally abusive'.\u00a0Ms Coulson then had to be 'interviewed' before being rejected by another surgery. In November, she was finally signed off for five months, after signing up to her third GP. The 21-year-old, who spends her days playing on Facebook, has not had a job for five years because she says she cannot stay awake . This healthy meal of carrots, potatoes, chicken and salad, recently posted by Ms Coulson, is an alternative to her usual takeaways and crisps . In total, Ms Coulson gets \u00a3411 in Personal Independence Payment a month, as well as \u00a3260 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) a fortnight. Her \u00a3135 a week rent is also covered through housing benefit. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net, and those with genuine conditions must of course be caught by it, but it can never become a comfort blanket and we must ask individuals to get themselves in shape to work. 'Taxpayers cannot afford to support individuals who simply choose not to work, so the authorities must be strict about who is deemed 'fit to work' or not. Ultimately, the benefit system has to encourage people to take responsibility for themselves.' Ms Coulson is now trying to lose weight by swapping her takeaways for healthy alternatives. She hopes that by losing some weight that she will be able to become more active. Nurse starting salary: \u00a321,388. This job requires students to complete a three-year degree at university. Nurses then work a complex shift pattern, including weekends, evenings and nights. Teacher starting salary: \u00a322,023. This requires the person to complete an undergraduate degree - usually three years long - and a one-year PGCE. Alternatively, the trainee teacher can complete an intensive year-long school-centred initial teacher training course on the job (SCITT). Care home worker: Between \u00a314,000 and \u00a318,000. This usually requires someone to complete a diploma in health and social care, as well as to undertake training and courses while on the job. She said: 'At the moment, it's hard for me to do everyday things like getting out of bed. The hardest is getting out of my mum's couch. It hurts my hips to lift myself out, because the sofa is broken due to my weight. 'My back also can't cope with standing for too long because of my weight, which means it very painful to walk.' She added: 'I'm dropping things like crisps and chocolate and replacing it with low fat Greek yoghurt. I used to eat takeaways on a regular basis but now I don't. 'Once I've shifted some, I can hopefully get out a little more.' Ms Coulson also said she had a blood test last week which showed she is borderline diabetic and has an underactive thyroid, for which she is now taking medication. A DWP spokesman said: 'Being obese in itself does not entitle a person to disability benefits, although the associated long-term health effects may. 'Decisions on whether a person is entitled to disability benefits are based on thorough assessments and consideration of any medical evidence, including from their GP.'",

Hotel staff found the body of pregnant Charmain Speirs face-down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days. Her husband Eric Isaiah Adusah \u2013 a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher \u2013 has been charged with her murder. Pastor Eric Isaiah Adusah has been charged with the murder of his pregnant wife, Charmaine Spears . Ms Speirs and Mr Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during their stay . Local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of 'opiate heroin overdose'. Mr Adusah's defence lawyer Mr Adomako Acheampong has claimed in court that 41-year-old Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user \u2013 and that her whole family were addicted to the drug. But speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Ms Speirs's brother Paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was 'an outrageous lie' to say his family were all addicts. He added: 'The defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that's absolute rubbish.' The gardener, 30, admitted that he had battled heroin addiction \u2013 but said it had been Ms Speirs who ensured he sought help at a Christian-run rehabilitation centre near Glasgow. He insisted he had now been drug-free for ten years. He also said his sister, who had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship, would not have taken any such substances of her own accord, adding: 'My sister was always against drugs.' The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010 . And he rejected the claim that his entire family, including parents Peter, 63, a self-employed plumber, and 61-year-old cleaner Linda, were addicted to drugs, saying: 'My parents can't stand the things.' He revealed that Charmain's family had been surprised at her 'whirlwind marriage' to Mr Adusah last September and had never trusted him. And he said that her friends had noticed changes in Ms Speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old Mr Adusah, who was based in Britain but is originally from Ghana. Ms Speirs grew up in Arbroath in the Angus region of Scotland before moving to Swansea, where she studied photojournalism and then worked as a radiography assistant for the NHS. Last year she married Mr Adusah, leader of the Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, North London. He has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. The couple travelled to Ghana early last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious rally. On March 16 after the rally the couple checked in to the upmarket Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua for five days. But when Mr Adusah left at dawn on their second day, he reportedly told reception staff not to disturb his wife as she was 'fasting and praying', and left a Do Not Disturb notice on the door. Hotel managers became concerned when Ms Speirs would not respond when they knocked. On March 20, porters used a spare key to gain access and made the grim discovery. Now her family are desperately seeking answers as they try to piece together fragments of information. Mr Speirs said: 'We've been left in the cold, we don't know a thing. My mum and dad just want to get Charmain's body back home.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Mr Adusah has been charged with murder in Ghana and has had his application for bail rejected. He has not yet entered a plea. The case has been adjourned until later this month.",

At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation . They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone . 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all. Bruce added: 'They are big players for us and unfortunately, at this moment, we haven't been able to cope. We've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough.' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth . Ronald Koeman's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham, who lost to Aston Villa, and Liverpool, who play Newcastle on Monday. But the Dutchman left with his own problems, after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice. Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules cannot be broken by anyone. Koeman said: 'I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly.'",

Brussels will say that Google has used its massive dominance as a search engine to divert internet users from rivals to its own services, which include YouTube and the Google+ social network. In one of the most high-profile competition cases of recent years, Europe could fine Google more than \u00a34 billion amid a wave of political opposition in Europe to the perceived dominance of US tech companies. Google currently boasts a 90 per cent share in Europe's search engine market. The European Union will accuse Google of illegally abusing its supremacy on the internet search market . But the ruling - the result of a five-year investigation into the American search giant \u2013 means Google may ultimately have to change its business model and pay multi-billion pound fines to Brussels. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, will today serve the company with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached anti-trust rules, according to the Financial Times. Google's competitors, including the computer giant Microsoft and sites such as travel booking firm Expedia and TripAdvisor, claim that its method of promoting its own companies above rivals on its search site stops them competing on a level playing field. And in a further blow to Google, the EU is also expected to probe Google's operating system for Android smartphones. The investigation will centre on whether Google imposes restrictions on phone makers that force them to favour their own apps, such as YouTube. Google has previously rejected the allegations, and insisted that Android is an open platform that is distributed for free. Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, will today serve Google with a formal charge sheet . After charges are issued, Google will have ten weeks to reply to Brussels, according to the Financial Times. They will also get the chance to argue their case in a formal hearing. The investigation into Google began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms. Google offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website. However Europe initially accepted that deal, only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions. Vestager, Europe's competition boss who was the inspiration for the hit Danish political drama series Borgen, took over the job in November and vowed to take Google on. Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the EU's decade-long battle with Microsoft, which ultimately cost the company \u00a31.6 billion in fines. If Google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by Brussels, the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed \u00a34 billion - about 10 per cent of Google's most recent annual revenue. The move will stop short of previous threats that the EU executive could consider breaking up Google to separate its business from the search engine. Google has faced searching antitrust questions across three continents for several years. But the latest move by the EU marks the first time the company has been accused of wrongdoing. The search engine is far more dominant in Europe than it is in the United States \u2013 where rivals like Microsoft's Bing enjoy a share of the market. And there has been fierce opposition to the dominance of Google from many countries in the EU. In fact twenty complainants want the search engine to abide by strict rules than ensure it treats its own services the same as it would its rivals. More than two dozen European organisations have filed antitrust complaints against Google. Many are from powerful publishing groups and online firms in Germany. They have previously called on the European regulator to force the American search engine to stop blocking competition in areas like online maps, shopping and travel services. And in France, lawyers have this week called on Google to reveal its secret formula for ranking websites \u2013 but Google argues such transparency would expose its business secrets to rivals and leave the search engine vulnerable to spam. Google and the EU commission declined to comment last night. Vestager's department is also looking into the tax affairs of Amazon, Starbucks, Fiat and Apple. In a recent Sunday Times article she said big companies should pay more as they 'are part of our society.' Insiders claim the case could prove just as costly as the EU's decade-long battle with Microsoft .",

It is understood that Ms Garcia - also known as Grace Cousins - moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s to work for Mr Cousins as a domestic helper before becoming his partner. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname.

Blanca \u2013 who was known as Blancs \u2013 was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July.

The master playmaker has been an outstanding force for Toulon in the French club's back-to-back Heineken Cup triumphs and Top 14 title success last season. Now, four years after his Test career appeared to be over when he was left out for the last World Cup, the 32-year-old has discovered that he is eligible to play for the Wallabies again. Toulon fly half Matt Giteau (left) takes on Leinster centre Ian Madigan during the Champions Cup semi-final . Former Wallabies Drew Mitchell (left) and Giteau have been integral to Toulon's European dominance . Giteau has not featured for Australia since he missed out on selection for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand . Like England, Australia had a policy of not picking anyone who plays abroad. But Giteau's supreme form for Toulon led to a clamour for him to be recalled and on Wednesday the ARU announced a change which is seemingly tailor-made for the man once known as Kid Dynamite. With immediate effect, Australia will pick 'elite' players based abroad \u2014 providing they have 60 caps and seven years of professional service at home. At a stroke, the Wallabies have gained more experience and firepower for the World Cup, while their Pool A rivals England and Wales have extra cause for concern. Former England lock Nick Kennedy was a Toulon team-mate during the victorious 2012-13 European campaign and the London Irish academy director told Sportsmail: 'When I turned up at Toulon there were many excellent players, but the one guy who stood head and shoulders above the rest was Matt Giteau. AUSSIES WHO CAN PLAY . Matt Giteau (Toulon): Can operate at No 10 or centre. Has excelled in France and craves another shot. Drew Mitchell (Toulon): The 31-year-old former Reds and Waratahs wing has 30 tries in his 63 Test appearances. George Smith (Lyon): Openside with 111 caps was last picked by the Wallabies for 2013 decider against the Lions. ENGLAND STARS WHO CAN'T . Nick Abendanon (Clermont Auvergne): On shortlist for European Player of the Year award. Steffon Armitage (Toulon): Reigning European Player of the Year and having another superb campaign. Toby Flood (Toulouse): Usurped by Owen Farrell in the England team, the rise of George Ford has left him off the radar. 'I had watched him play for years but seeing him in training, seeing what he could do, was a shock. He is just so talented and is still one of the best players in the world. 'His ability is incredible, as is his decision-making. He's still got pace, his passing is so accurate and he's got a great kicking game. Defensively he gets stuck in, too. He's a great all-round player and, if anything, he has improved from spending time in France. He can do it all.' Giteau himself greeted the announcement from Down Under on Wednesday by tweeting: 'Massive news re policy change. The ultimate honour to represent your country, however form still must warrant selection.' That shouldn't be an issue. His Toulon team-mate, Drew Mitchell, is another Australian who could find himself back in World Cup contention but his initial reaction was to champion Giteau's claims. 'The fact he is not only playing in Europe but dominating it for a number of years \u2014 he not only would be able to handle Test rugby, he'd add a great deal of value in the World Cup squad,' said Mitchell . Ex-Toulon lock Nick Kennedy considers his former team-mate Giteau one the best players in the world . The ARU decision has been made in response to an exodus of leading lights to Europe. There are potential implications for the clubs who have recruited these players, who may now be called upon for Test duty rather than being able to commit themselves fully to their new employers throughout the season. That in turn may lead to renewed club v country tension, but not in the case of Harlequins, who have signed Australia lock and former captain James Horwill. 'It's not an issue for us,' said Conor O'Shea, Quins' director of rugby. 'We never want our players to turn their backs on playing for their country and there are windows for that. If the Wallabies wanted to pick James, that's great.' James Horwill (above) has recently signed for Harlequins but will still be eligible to play for the Wallabies . Australia's revised stance will lead to further calls for the RFU to relax their policy against picking players based abroad but Northampton's England flanker Tom Wood on Wednesday echoed comments by Tom Youngs of Leicester about the threat to squad unity and morale if the 'exceptional circumstances' clause is invoked to call up the likes of Steffon Armitage from Toulon. 'I am not against it in principle but I wouldn't like us to back-pedal on that now,' he said. 'It could have an effect on the team and undermine some of the togetherness we have built. 'If people start to lose faith and think there is an imbalance, then people aren't pulling in the same direction.' Tom Wood (right) believes Stuart Lancaster should still not select overseas players such as Steffon Armitage .",

Responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office, Obama told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that such an approach 'would be foolish.' 'And, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way,' the president added. Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter, saying, 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them.' Scroll down for video . Foolish: In an interview with NPR, Obama said likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker may change his 'foolish' position on a deal with Iran 'after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy' Obama's jab at Walker departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term . Obama's jab at Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term. The current administration has been more willing to weigh in, however, when a presumed Republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president's prized domestic or foreign policies, which, in the case of Walker, was the nuclear arrangement with Iran. 'I am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they won't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries,' Obama told Inskeep during their Monday afternoon chat following the NPR host's invocation of Walker's past comments. 'If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies.' Continuing, Obama said, that 'would be a foolish approach to take' and slammed Walker. A cadre of probable Republican presidential contenders have spoken out against the Obama administration's laboriously negotiated pact with Iran to stunt the growth of the country's program. Walker is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor's deal with Iran and the international community if elevated to presidency, however. 'If I ultimately choose to run, and if I\u2019m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing \u2014 not just for the region but for this world \u2014 we need is a nuclear-armed Iran,' he told radio host Charlie Sykes last week. 'It leaves not only problems for Israel, because they want to annihilate Israel, it leaves the problems in the sense that the Saudis, the Jordanians and others are gonna want to have access to their own nuclear weapons.' Obama has said on repeat that he believes a diplomatic agreement with Iran that shuts down, in theory, its pathways to developing a bomb will be more effective  than a military option. Obama was responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office. Walker is currently the governor of Wisconsin . Swatting Walker away: Obama takes part in the White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn, which included a spot of tennis . 'We're now in a position where Iran has agreed to unprecedented inspections and verifications of its program, providing assurances that it is peaceful in nature,' he told NPR, touting the accord that representatives of his administration and five other countries reached with Iran. Furthermore, the global community will have assurances that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranious 'remains in a place where they cannot create a nuclear weapon,' he said. 'This deal is the right thing to do for the United States, for our allies in the region and for world peace.' Obama said 'it's a hard argument to make that we're better off right now' having 'no insight' into Iran's facilities 'and letting them rush towards a bomb.' And if Iran doesn't change its behavior, Obama said the U.S. will 'still have the options available to me - or available to a future president that I have available to me right now.' Included in that portfolio will be the ability to reinstate financial sanctions on the country at any time nuclear experts at the\u00a0International Atomic Energy Agency determine its broken the rules. Other areas of the plan remain fuzzy and will await clarification in a final round of talks, scheduled to take place by the end of June. Already a fissure between the United States' and Iran on sanctions - the U.S. will only commit to gradual relief that can be 'snapped back' into place while Iran is taking the stance that restrictions should be removed immediately and permanently in exchange for nuclear concessions - has emerged since the countries announced the preliminary agreement last Thursday. Obama told NPR his administration still isn't sure it 'can button down' all the issues standing in the way of a long-term agreement and it will have to 'work very hard in order to complete a deal.' And while he characterized Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demand that a final deal force Iran to recognize his country's right to exist as a 'fundamental misjudgment' of the political waters, Obama noted that one of the most 'profound' differences between America and Iran 'is the vile, anti-Semitic statements that have often come out of the highest levels of the Iranian regime.' 'So what I would say to the Israeli people is you are right to be suspicious of Iran. There's no reason why you should let your guard down with respect to Iran,' he said. 'But ultimately, Iran is deterrable, and it is deterrable not just because of Israel's superior military and intelligence capabilities but also because you got a really strong ally in the United States of America.' Shifting to the topic of Cuba briefly, Obama confirmed that he was considering removing the Latin American country from the U.S.' list of countries that sponsor terrorism. 'Understand that the criteria is very straightforward. Is this particular country considered a state sponsor of terrorism, not, do we agree with them on everything, not whether they engage in repressive or authoritarian activities in their own country,' he said. 'And so those standards, those criteria are the ones that are going to be measured against the current activities of the Cuban government.' Obama said he'll make a decision after he receives the State Department's recommendation. The president said his most pressing concern was whether he could effect the United States' relationship with the communist country in a way that 'benefits the Cuban people over the long term.' 'There are areas where there are serious differences' between the two countries, he said. 'But I do see the possibility -- a great hunger within Cuba -- to begin a change, a process that ultimately, I think, can lead to more freedom and more opportunity.'",

Co-founder Nina Leykind said: 'It's like the Baskin Robbins of mascara. Getting it right is about the combination. One doesn\u2019t work without the other. 'Even if you have an amazing brush for you, if it\u2019s put together with the wrong formula then it doesn\u2019t work.' Foundation, too, is set to see a surge in personalisation.

Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer,\u00a0@AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'",

The man, who is seen unsteady on his feet and swaying after the day at the races in Aintree, barges into the 63-year-old who then stumbles backwards and falls to the floor in the middle of the road. The 34-year-old man, dressed in a suit, then walks off as people gasp and try to help the victim who was left lying on the floor. Scroll down for video . An Aintree racegoer is seen staggering towards an elderly man, before he barges into him and knocks him onto the floor into a road, leaving the man injured and lying on the floor as he walks off . He was later taken to hospital and treated for bruising on his face. Merseyside Police said the 34-year-old from Formby in Sefton came forward to police late last night and he was interviewed under caution about the alleged assault. He was released this morning pending further inquiries. The man was named on social media as a manager called Terry. Philip Dears, who took the video, posted on Facebook today: 'I have a 2 minute long video of my mate Terry drunk walking home from the races on Thursday, during which he staggers and accidentally bumps into an old man. The man falls and I'm filming the whole situation trying not to laugh. 'When I realise the seriousness of the situation the phone goes off, the laughing stops and I check on the old man, he is hurt on the floor but is being seen to by stewards awaiting medical attention. I turned my attention to Terry and wanted to make sure he gets home safety.' In the post Mr Dears said he and his wife phoned the hospital to check on the elderly man's condition. He also claims the video, which appears on YouTube, has been edited to make it appear the old man was deliberately targeted when this was not the case. The man stumbles backwards and falls, as the video is filmed by a sniggering friend of the alleged perpetrator . He added: 'When you see the video you will see this is a total accidental collision, it's important people get this truth because a lot of people are very upset and I can see why because it looks like a malicious, cowardly attack but this is far from the reality of the situation. ' The footage was brought to the attention of officers by members of the public who had shared it online. Police established the mobile phone footage, shot by a friend of the 34-year-old, was taken outside the racecourse on Thursday evening at about 7pm. He shouts to him 'text bomb' and 'is there any need?' moments before the incident happens as he sniggers uncontrollably from behind his phone. In the video, onlookers can be heard gasping in shock and seen rushing to the man's aid before calling for an ambulance. Officers said the man who was knocked to the floor is from Skelmersdale in West Lancashire. People have expressed their shock at the video. The 63-year-old man is seen standing on the pavement before the other man barges into him and knocks him . He becomes unsteady on his feet from the impact and begins to stumble, before he tumbles backwards . Gasps can be heard on the mobile phone footage as members of the public rush to help the injured man . Paul Hardman wrote: 'That video of the old man at Aintree\u00a0makes me sick to the stomach. Some absolute scum in this world.' Others labelled his behaviour 'disgusting' and 'vile.' Hayley Wills added: 'Hope that horrible man that knocked over the old chap at Aintree gets what he deserves, as well as the sick person that filmed it.' Merseyside Police earlier thanked visitors for making the annual race 'such a safe and enjoyable occasion' and said no arrests were made inside the ground over the three days. An online crowdfunding page has been set up to help the injured man.Concerned wellwishers have already raised \u00a3345 to help the pensioner with his recovery after Joanne Dickson saw Gary's response and launched the fundraising campaign. Page owner Joanne said: 'Most of us tonight have watched the horrible video of the gentleman being knocked to the ground.

'I don't know the gentleman, I would just like him to know that most decent people are disgusted that, even if the knock was an accident, that no remorse was shown.'",

Philipp Lahm will look to lead his team into the semi-final of the Champions League on Tuesday . Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time.

The Spaniard, who wore a T-shirt made by the family of an Argentine journalist killed in a car crash at last year's World Cup, said his team would try everything to overturn the first leg deficit despite the injury problems. 'It makes no sense to be on the pitch if you don't want to turn it around. We want to turn it around,' he said.",

During the last stages of his disease he lost the ability to talk, but he never lost his love of life and his sense of fun. Brad sung heartily about the highs and lows of marriage . 'He had a computer where he could type in the words and it would read it out,' Mrs Beringer said. 'Even then he\u2019d be making you laugh. He was still in good spirits even though he couldn\u2019t talk.' 'Despite his disease he was there always up for a laugh until the very end. Brad\u2019s speech was a kind of celebration of that.' She agreed some of the song's lyrics were not the kind most newly married women might like to hear. 'Well it's done now, you can't turn back. You're legally binded by the wedding trap,' Mr Fraser sang. 'For better for worse, it's only a curse, so open your wallet\u2026and fill up her purse.' Everyone in attendance at the wedding couldn't get enough of Brad's ditty . The crowd, who in a video of the performance posted online can be heard bursting out in laughter, erupt into a standing ovation at the end. 'It was very funny \u2013 although maybe not the best advice to be giving my husband from my perspective!' Mrs Beringer said. 'But it was very touching. It brought a tear to my eye and pulled a lot of heartstrings.' Mr Fraser said he regularly works as a master of ceremonies at social functions, but always gives 10 per cent of his fee to the Motor Neuron Association. Far from a conventional toast, Mr Fraser's song poked fun at some of the burdens of marriage . The song was also a tribute to Brad and Amanda's father, Peter, who passed away of Motor Neuron Disease 10 years earlier . 'Motor Nueron Disease doesn\u2019t affect your brain \u2013 it affects everything else,' Mr Fraser told Daily Mail Australia. 'My Dad would be sitting there not saying anything or just moaning, but you knew he was getting the joke. 'They\u2019re laughing inside and you know that. So to give everyone a laugh at the wedding was important. It\u2019s what my Dad would have wanted.' The musical toast was such a success that wedding guests gave it a standing ovation .",

But did the professionals get it right? Not according to the EA Sports\u2019 Performance Index anyway. Sergio Aguero nets his 21st strike of the season against Aston Villa. He has scored one more than Harry Kane . Cesc Fabregas, in action against his former club Arsenal on Sunday, and Aguero are in the EA Sports Team . Eden Hazard poses with his individual gong at Sunday's night's PFA Player of the Year awards in London . The system, which measures a player's contribution to the success of his team, sees Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Aguero, scorer of 21 goals this term, replace  Diego Costa up front. Aguero is one of five changes from the PFA Team of the Year.\u00a0The EA Sports\u2019 side sees two fewer Chelsea players in the line-up with Gary Cahill and Nemanja Matic failing to make the team.

Aaron Cresswell beats Ryan Bertrand to fill the left-back slot after impressing for West Ham.

The family's actions were condemned on social media sites after pictures of the incident appeared online in Argentina. One user, Amatista Avalos Muro, wrote: 'This is absolutely unbelievable. These parents are setting their kids up for death.' Another, Ramses Crespo Cruz, posted: 'So sad that some parents are so irresponsible. Those poor children.'

Katie Cope, 17, said she feared being assaulted by the agitated woman after police repeatedly refused to give her an estimated time for their arrival. She had to close the shop and put down the electronic shutter after the thief became abusive towards other customers and kept trying to leave. Let down: Store owner Eve Cope with assistant, Sol, who helped Katie to detain the shoplifter . When police finally got to the vintage clothing store, they said the stolen knickers, which had been reduced to \u00a31, were not worth enough to prosecute. Yesterday, Katie and her mother Eve Cope, 60, told of their fury at the police\u2019s response and accused officers of giving a \u2018green light\u2019 to shoplifters by merely cautioning the 66-year-old culprit. Mrs Cope, who has owned the Baklash store in Nottingham city centre for 33 years, was away when the thief struck last Thursday. She said: \u2018I was really scared for the safety of my daughter. I do feel like the police let the shoplifter off. \u2018This must be the fifth time I have had to deal with a shoplifter in the last few years \u2013 on one occasion I was even assaulted and hit my head on the pavement outside the shop when I tried to stop a thief. \u2018The police asked me to drop the case against the girl responsible because she offered to apologise and pay for the shirt she stole.\u2019 Katie said: \u2018It is a ridiculous situation. I could have been in trouble if the woman had reacted aggressively to being held in the shop. \u2018I\u2019m really disappointed with the police. Letting this woman off just gives a green light to shoplifters.\u2019 A male shop assistant called Sol was working with Katie when she spotted the shoplifter leaving with a pair of knickers in her handbag. Katie stopped the thief outside the shop at 2.50pm and led her back inside while Sol dialled 101 \u2013 the police non-emergency number. Katie said: \u2018I was not going to let her go. She didn\u2019t apologise and when police eventually got here she lied about her age and her name three times.\u2019 Officers arrived within nine minutes after Mrs Cope, pictured outside her store, made a formal complaint . When Katie was still waiting for a police response three hours later, Mrs Cope rang to make a formal complaint and officers arrived nine minutes later, at 6.10pm. Mrs Cope said: \u2018They told us that because the underwear was only priced at \u00a31, they would not prosecute. \u2018I told them it wasn\u2019t just the value of the knickers at play here, but the fact we had lost three hours of trade by having to close. They just told me I would have to pursue a civil case for damages against the thief if I wanted to take it further.\u2019 Local councillor Michael Edwards called the incident \u2018concerning\u2019. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: \u2018We aim to provide the best possible service to anyone who calls to report a crime, but in periods of high demand response times can be affected.\u2019 Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping said: \u2018I am sorry that the business in question had a problem. Shoplifting is not as much of a problem as it used to be.\u2019 However, figures from crime data analysts, UK Crime Stats, showed that in Nottingham there was a rise in shoplifting offences from 288 last February to 324 this February.",

But Annegret Raunigk is set to become the oldest woman in the world to have quadruplets \u2013 at the age of 65.

Miss Raunigk, who features in a documentary on German television tonight, said she was not too worried about the birth, adding: \u2018I feel fit. I don\u2019t think I will have any problems.\u2019 She is in her 21st week of pregnancy after being artificially inseminated, using both donated sperm and eggs. The identity of the babies\u2019 father is unknown. Speaking of the moment she learned she was carrying quadruplets, she said: \u2018Sure, it was a shock for me. \u2018Once the physician established that there are four babies inside me then I had to do some thinking.\u2019 Miss Raunigk, who teaches English and Russian, said her gynaecologist mentioned the possibility of an abortion but she decided against this option. The mother, from Berlin, previously made headlines in Germany after giving birth to her youngest daughter Leila a decade ago, aged 55. Her 13 children \u2013 the eldest of whom is daughter Antje, 44 \u2013 are by five different fathers. Miss Raunigk\u2019s physician, Dr Kai Hertwig, said everything was going well. He added: \u2018So far her age has not come into play but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high risk. We are keeping a close watch on her heart circulatory system, but we have little or no experience with a woman of this age.\u2019 Fame: The mother previously made headlines in Germany in 2005 after giving birth to her youngest daughter Leila a decade ago, when she was 55 (pictured) Miss Raunigk claimed she had no moral qualms about getting pregnant later in life, saying: \u2018I think one needs to decide for oneself and not listen too much to the opinions of others.\u2019 The record for the oldest woman to give birth to quadruplets is held by Merryl Fudel from the US, who was 55.

Rand fans will still find the usual array of yard signs and bumper stickers. But they'll also have the opportunity to sport their support  through Macbook skins and woven blankets that feature Paul's face, 'Stand with Rand' flip-flops and car mats and a host of other unique items like the 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker.' Scroll down for video . Libertarian icon Rand Paul has expanded his campaign store to include an array of unconventional SWAG, including the 'Rand on a Stick' item feature above, as he kicks off his presidential campaign . An ophthalmologist by trade, the store contains eye charts bearing Paul's name and his campaign slogan because 'we need a president who can see clearly,' as the site states . For $75 Paul fans can own a throw rug featuring the Kentucky senator. It also comes in a Constitution theme for the same price .

The freshman senator's expansion of his campaign store to include 'Paul for president' items preceded an announcement this morning on the website that said: 'I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government.' An unofficial candidate for the last year, the statement made formal the tea partier's entry into the 2016 contest a few hours before he was scheduled to hold a campaign kick-off in his home state. He'll spend the rest of the week rallying supporters in early presidential primary states New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada, in that order, before making his back to Washington for his day job.

Loyalists of the 52-year-old freshman senator and his father Ron, a former Texas representative who sought the presidency in 2008 and 2012, are known for the fervency of their support and organizational skills. Tonight they'll celebrate the younger Paul's entry into 2016 competition with 'Stand with Rand' #LibertyKaraoke parties across the country.

Playing off the Stand with Rand theme, the description accompanying a pair of $20 sandals in the store says, 'no, really stand with Rand in official campaign flip flops.' Beer steins and t-shirts rock an 'unleashed' dog wearing patriotic sunglasses and holding an American flag in his mouth.

But that won't phase Arsene Wenger's side at all, with a creditable record of three cup final wins in five appearances in the yellow and blue strip, giving Gunners fans room for optimism as they look to retain the FA Cup. Arsenal last wore yellow in the 1980 FA Cup final where they narrowly lost to London rivals West Ham United, but a year earlier donned the same colours as they got the better of Manchester United in a five-goal thriller at the home of English football. The Gunners also won the competition in 1950 and 1971 while wearing yellow, on both occasions seeing off Liverpool.

Arsenal skipper Joe Mercer is held up by his team-mates as they toast their victory over Liverpool in 1950 . Fabian Delph (middle) is mobbed by his Villa team-mates after he scored the winner against Liverpool . Interestingly though, despite Villa winning the pre-match coin toss, Arsenal will be classed as the home side for the final as this is decided purely alphabetically. The kick-off time for the clash - which will be shown on both BBC One and BT Sport 1 - has also been confirmed as 5.30pm on Saturday May 30, with both clubs receiving an equal allocation of 25,000 tickets. These tickets will be classified into four different pricing bands - \u00a350, \u00a370, \u00a390 and \u00a3120. In addition to the 50,000 tickets split between the two clubs involved, approximately 20,000 tickets also will be distributed to volunteers throughout the football family which most notably includes counties, leagues, local clubs and charities. And 17,000 tickets will also be used by Club Wembley members, with the FA Cup final part of their membership package.",

The Prime Minister took advice from martial arts pupils about the best way to deal with the Ukip leader when they go up against each other in the two-hour showdown. Sensing he may have gone too far with the threat to to wrestle his opponent to the ground, Mr Cameron later backtracked, insisting there will be 'no bodily contact' during the debate. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron took advice from martial arts pupils in Warrington about the best way to deal with the Ukip leader when they go up against each other in the two-hour showdown . The Tory leader paid a visit to the Kings Leadership Academy in Warrington ahead of the seven-way debate tonight . All of the party leaders have spent the day preparing for tonight's debate, with Mr Cameron facing the prospect of having to defend the Tory-led government from attack on several fronts. Mr Cameron visited King's Leadership Academy in Warrington, where he spoke to pupils about their favourite sports. Chatting in a playground, the Tory leader said: 'In this debate tonight, jujitsu, is that the right thing?' To laughter he added: 'Shall I get Nigel Farage and put him on the floor, is that OK?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test . But later he played down the idea of physical violence, telling reporters: 'It was a joke. There'll be no bodily contact tonight.' Today Mr Cameron insisted he was not nervous and was 'relishing' the prospect of the two-hour debate in the ITV studios at Salford's MediaCityUK. Mr Cameron told reporters: 'It is a chance to get across that we have a long-term economic plan that is working.' For his part, Mr Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test, telling Sky News: 'I hope the truth comes out on some issues. 'Particularly, I shall be arguing and asking the Prime Minister and others, will they please admit that, as members of the EU, we cannot have an immigration policy of any kind at all.' Mr Cameron and Mr Farage will share the platform tonight with \u00a0Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the Green Party's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. It is the only time Mr Cameron will go up against Mr Miliband, with one of them certain to be Prime Minister after May 7. The Prime Minister was accused by Labour of 'running scared' after dodging a head-to-head showdown with the Labour leader. After Mr Cameron objected to broadcasters' plans for three TV debates during the five-and-a-half week campaign, the ITV show marks the only occasion before the May 7 election when the Tory and Labour leaders will face each other. With all the polls pointing to an extremely tight contest, the leaders of the two biggest parties will be anxious to avoid any costly slips while looking for the opportunity to score points at expense of their rival. Mr Clegg said he would go for a walk to 'clear my head' before making his way to the TV studios, while Mr Miliband said the best preparation was 'getting out to meet people'. Labour leader Ed Miliband poses for a selfie with voters after holding a question and answer session in the Town Hall of Bury . Nick Clegg was in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, today while the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon attended the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood . Addressing supporters in Bury, Mr Miliband said the most important people on the night for him were not the other six leaders or moderator Julie Etchingham but 'the British public'. Lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The agreed line up behind the podiums will be, from left to right: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first, with Ms Bennett opening proceedings and Mr Cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks. The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm. Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people. Conservative Chairman Grant Shapps arrives to meet party activists as he helps with their canvassing in  Somerset today . Green Party Leader Natalie Bennett meets supporters  in Piccadilly Gardens as she arrives in Manchester ahead of the TV debate . ITV newsreader Julie Etchingham\u00a0will keep order with just one ad break during the two-hour election showdown . Lots have been drawn to decide the order in which each leader will speak, including the opening and closing statements and giving one-minute answers to the four studio audience questions . They will then be allowed to deliver an uninterrupted one-minute answer to each question, before 18 minutes of debate on each question. There will be just four 'substantial election questions' covered during the night. Each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras, before the programme ends at 10pm. Michael Jermey, ITV's Director of News and Current Affairs said: 'The programme will provide a fair forum for a proper debate between the party leaders. 'Our viewers greatly valued the debates in 2010 and we know many are looking forward to this programme. 'It'll be an opportunity to hear the leaders directly challenge each other and discuss face-to-face some of the big election issues facing the country.",

Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe distinctive patterns on butterfly wings really do help protect the insects by mimicking the eyes of predators. While scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry, it has never been clearly tested. Recently researchers suggested that the eye spots may simply scare away predators by confusing them or overloading their senses. Owl butterflies (left) have eye spots that mimic those of pigmy owls (right) to scare off predators like great tits.\u00a0While scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry, it has never been clearly tested . But a new piece of research by biologists at Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University in Finland claims to have settled the debate. They say that eye-spots on the wings of butterflies do in fact mimic the eyes of larger and more threatening species, like owls. Having bright colours and distinguishing features is a common way for insects to scare away predators like birds. Often they help to lure them away from vital body parts or confuse them. However, this only works on predators that hunt using sight while bats tend to be immune to such devices. Now scientists have found that a moth has an unusual evolutionary adaptation that allows it to confuse the ultrasound used by bats. The luna moth has two tails that extend for more than an inch beyond its body. Scientists in the US showed that these appendages produce a confusing acoustic signature in the bats echolocation. It makes the bats target the end of the tails rather than the moth itself. This helps to keep other birds that might normally eat the insects away. The team were finally able to test the theory by showing great tits pictures of owl butterflies that had been digitally altered, and watching their reaction. Images where the eye spots had been removed from the butterfly wings did not stop the birds from snatching a mealworm snack below the picture. However, when pictures that had not been digitally altered flashed on the screen, the birds were more weary. And the researchers found the butterfly eye spots may even be more terrifying to the great tits than the real animal they are mimicking. When shown pictures of a pygmy owl with its eyes open the tits reacted strongly and kept away, but their reaction was not as strong as with the butterfly markings. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr Johanna Mappes and her colleagues said: 'In this study, the presumed model - owl eyes - and the mimic eyespots appeared to elicit similar reactions both in terms of response type - interest versus aversion - and its intensity - startle versus flee - adding support to the eye-mimicry hypothesis. The researchers flashed up digitally manipulated images of an owls face and the owl butterfly to see how great tits reacted. In some images they removed the owls eyes (far left) or removed the eye spots (far right) Eye spots are a common feature on butterfly wings, like the\u00a0Bycyclus anyana butterfly above, but scientists have been divided over whether they were intended to mimic other predators or simply confuse predators . 'Predator-prey interactions in nature often involve dynamic encounters between the partners, and eye spots are more likely to appear suddenly in front of the predator. 'Their intimidating effect has been proved to increase when they are revealed abruptly. 'We therefore conclude that it is unlikely that the adaptive value of eye spots is due to sensory or information overload caused by the conspicuousness of colour pattern.' The researchers conducted their experiments by placing wild captured great tits into a cage where the floor had been fitted with a computer monitor. The birds were offered a dead mealworm and as they approached an image was flashed up on the computer screen. Images of owl eyes caused the birds to be startled, flee and in some cases give off alarm calls. but images of owls without eyes did not produce the same reaction. Atlas moths (above) have colourful patterns on their wings that are thought to mimic the head of a cobra . A cobra poses a far greater threat to a predator than an Atlas moth and so by mimicking the reptile with the patterns on its wings the moth is able to scare off potential hunters that might make it a tasty snack . However when the birds were shown images of the owl butterfly, they were also scared away. If the irises of the eye spots were removed, or the eye spots removed altogether, then they were scared away far less often. Many species of butterfly have eye-spots as part of the pattern on their wings. The Atlas butterfly, for example, has a pattern that looks like the head of a cobra. Some entomologists have also claimed that the Eyed hawk moth look like the head of a fox when viewed from the front. In one extreme example of mimicry, the caterpillar of the Eastern tiger swallowtail looks like a snake and spits a foul smelling chemical to keep away predators. Last year scientists at Oregon State University looked at the butterfly Bycyclus anyana and showed that it varies the intensity of its eye spots depending on the season. They claimed bright colours in the rainy season allowed the butterfly to confuse the dominant predators - preying mantids - while duller colours in the dry season helped them hide from birds. Some entomologists claim the eyed hawk moth looks like the face of a fox or dog from the front . The wing patterns of the eyed hawk moth is said to resemble the dark nose and the light coloured eyes of a fox .",

In January 2013, Dorian Poe, from Burlington, Ontario, sent his favorite toy out on the global adventure, having been inspired by the story of a cancer-stricken girl who, unable to live her own dreams of world travel, sent her teddy bear in her place. Hoping to raise the same level of global awareness about his own condition, Dorian decided to send his Ganz Webkinz bear, called Tikko, out into the world, carrying with him a message of understanding and tolerance for those affected by autism. Scroll down for video . 'It's okay to be different': Dorian Poe, 11, with his beloved bear Tikko, whose travels have raised awareness for autism all over the world . With the help and support of his mother Christine, Dorian, who was then nine years old, sent Tikko off on the first leg of his adventure in back in January 2013. Now, the bear has circled the globe and then some, continuing to share his vital message, while inviting the world to join in with his journey\u00a0online. 'When I first decided to support Dorian in his campaign, it was because I was happy to see him want to \u201cpay it forward\u201d' Christine tells DailyMail.com. 'I fundraise each year to pay the $24,500.00/year tuition it costs for Dorian to go to a special needs school. I was thrilled to support Tikko because Dorian had found a way to give back to our community; a community that has been wonderful at supporting our fundraising efforts.' Hello, my name is Dorian. I have autism, and so does my pet polar bear Tikko. Tikko is about to go traveling on an adventure; and I need you to take care of him. My polar bear wants to raise autism awareness. Just call him 'Tikko the Autism Bear' or 'Tikko'. Guess what, this guy is much more different than the other polar bears you know. Things you should look out for: . To accompany Tikko the autistic bear on his adventures, Dorian included a letter explaining the characteristics and challenges involved in having autism \u2013 using the toy to help other people understand what the various aspects of the condition can feel like. Each family who receivedTikko on his travels would take on the job of raising awareness in his or her community \u2013 helping to spread Dorian\u2019s message across the globe, while he remained at home in Canada. But the mother and son could never have known what a phenomenon Tikko would become. 'In January when Tikko took his first trip to Jamaica, I connected with another mom there whose child had autism,' Christine explains. 'There was little to no support for autism in Jamaica.' Hearing such a story from so far away, Christine began to research autism in the other countries Tikko was visiting, and she shared what she learned on the campaign's Facebook page. And two weeks after the Tikko had begun his adventures, Christine became involved in coordinating them. After media attention grew, and demand for visits from Tikko increased, Christine received a donation of new Tikkos from toy company GANZ, who offered 600 bears to the cause in order to help the family cope with the overwhelming amount of interest. \u2018For the first few months there was only one Tikko,\u2019 Christine explained. \u2018It wasn\u2019t long before we realized we could reach people faster by having more Tikko\u2019s available. So I wrote to GANZ (the maker of the Webkinz Polar Bear), and to date they have donated 600 polar bears to us!\u2019 With so many Tikko bears in the mix, running the campaign became a full-time job for Christine. At the gate: Tikko made it to 24 countries in his first 10 months of traveling . A towering success: The little bear has made it to some of the world's most instantly-recognizable landmarks . She keeps supporters informed with daily updates on Tikko's location on Facebook and Twitter, receives new Tikko travel photos every day, and promotes the awareness campaign across autism networking sites. However, Christine says: 'No matter how busy I am, I always have time to listen and offer support to those dealing with the challenges of having a child on the spectrum.' Tikko's\u00a0Facebook page documents every destination he has reached in dozens of photos. He's posed at some of the world's most famous landmarks, hobnobbed with A-list celebrities, and even\u00a0scraped the skies in a daring aerial show, all the while broadcasting the important message splashed across his T-shirt: 'Autism\u2026it\u2019s okay to be different!' The campaign has affected children all over the world who have autism, not in the least the young boy who started it all. A message in motion: Tikko spreads awareness with his motto:\u00a0'Autism\u2026it\u2019s okay to be different!' Getting back to his roots: Tikko has even made it as far as the North Pole, which was a dream of owner Dorian . 'Dorian feels a sense of purpose,' says mom Christine. 'He feels he is not only helping the world, but also his school peers. He\u2019s gained confidence, and he\u2019s made & kept friends more easily. 'He\u2019s matured a great deal since starting his campaign. It has also brought us closer together \u2013 we share a very special bond.' Today there are still 20 Tikkos on the go, and the work is far from over. 'Tikko is still travelling, and will be for many years to come!' says Christine. 'He is just back from Kuwait, Lithuania, Nice and Scotland. He\u2019s currently in Germany. 'Another Tikko is on the set of the Dragon's Den. Another Tikko is packed and ready to visit Mount Fuji in Japan. The list goes on. Tikko is one busy bear!'",

A survey of 600 employers and senior executives has revealed that the biggest CV blunder is spelling or grammar mistakes . It has been revealed that the worst CV blunder is a spelling or grammatical mistake, with a whopping 87 per cent of the 600 employers admitting that they find it annoying. Other high ranking errors are incorrect personal information (wrong contact names and companies), and also if key information such as contact details are missing. Unsurprisingly, brevity is valued, with a massive 46 per cent of the polled senior executives finding long waffling CVs irritating, with only 26 per cent disliking short resumes. Another high ranking resume error flagged by employers is incorrect personal information . The survey also revealed that employers prefer a professional quality to a CV, with nearly half (44 per cent) disliking if the tone seemed too informal or casual.

Justin Jackson, a Florida man, has been carrying out the bizarre schemes in the hope of cashing in on the freebies, or winning himself a job in luxurious hotels, according to court documents. Jackson is being sued by Oprah's TV network as well as Love - the college basketball star who went on to be the President's personal assistant. 'Con man': Justin Jackson, right, has been accused of pretending to be a host of celebrity-linked characters in order to score freebies and jobs. Angel Agarrat, left, is also named in a Florida lawsuit attempting to get the pair to stop posing as other people . Legal papers filed in a south Florida federal court describe Jackson waging an eight-year trail of deceit in which he variously posed as Oprah herself, Oprah's nephew, Love, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), and managers of Madonna and Johnny Depp. The earliest fraud, the papers said, saw Jackson trick a New York City jeweler into lending him items worth $2.4million by pretending to be Madonna's manager. He contacted a store in July 2007 and said she needed the lavish items for a photoshoot, the papers said. When he got the items, he reportedly sold them to another jeweler and fled. The court papers say he was convicted for grand theft over the ruse, but later dreamed up new celebrity-linked schemes. The latest claims say Jackson pretended to be Oprah and her representatives in the hope of getting more freebies - and even posed as the famous talk show host to recommend him for jobs. He allegedly sent letters on forged OWN stationery to \u00a0five different hotel groups with locations in Florida, recommending himself for work at the locations. 'Impersonator': Jackson (right) is accused of sending messages purporting to be former Obama aide Reggie Love (left), whom he said worked for Oprah. The right-hand photograph, court papers claim, was emailed from an email account allegedly belonging to Johnny Depp's manager, asking for tickets to see Oprah . The papers claim some of the notes purportedly to be directly from Oprah, while others claimed to be from Love, who was signed off as the star's 'executive assistant and personal aide'. Also named in the claims was Angel Agarrat, whom lawyers claim was also involved in the deception, and was subject of some of the bogus letters of recommendation for jobs. In one of the exchanges, Jackson allegedly suggested that if he and Agarrat were to be given work at the hotels, Oprah would make a personal appearance there. One letter even claimed Jackson was Oprah's nephew. Love has never worked for Oprah. Other schemes allegedly saw Jackson write to four different jewelry companies, as well as a clothe retailer, to get free goods allegedly meant for Oprah. Scheme: According to the claims, Jackson signed some emails off as Oprah, left, and others as Scott Garner, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The claims date from around September 2013 to the end of 2014. The documents also say Jackson has a history of pretending to be Love, and had tried in 2010 to trade off Love's own name to get free designer clothes, handbags and Cheesecake Factory vouchers. In a final case, Jackson . OWN, Love and Scott Garner, an executive at Oprah's company whose name was used, filed a joint suit against Jackson and Agarrat this week. It accuses the two of invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names, infringing trademarks and conspiracy. The documents ask that a judge files an injunction to stop the two using any of the false names, and also stakes a claim for financial damages. Although no figures are specified, arguments in the court papers imply that the figure will be at least $75,000.",

Since late January, their work in the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez had consumed their lives. It was nothing like \"Law & Order.\" The days were long and tedious. Now it was over. \"It's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us,\" Lesa Strachan told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury. A day earlier, Strachan, the jury foreperson, announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of Hernandez's onetime friend Odin Lloyd. Strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots. \"You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period.\" Before the trial, at least one juror -- Rosalie Oliver -- hadn't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison. But Kelly Dorsey watches the Patriots every Sunday during the football season. She said so on her jury questionnaire. \"I knew of him as a football player, not a person,\" she said. It didn't affect her vote to convict, she said. It didn't matter that he was a football player, she said. Nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder. \"To leave your friend on the ground, knowing that he's not there anymore -- he's either dead or he's going to die -- that's indifference,\" Dorsey said of Hernandez. \"He didn't need to pull the trigger.\" That word -- \"indifference\" -- was used multiple times by members of the jury. Jon Carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that Hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies. Hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men. That indifference \"surprised a lot of us,\" Carlson said. He stressed the fact that Hernandez played football for a living didn't influence the jury's decision. \"It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,\" Carlson said. Lloyd was seen June 17, 2013, around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Later that day, a jogger found his body. He had been shot six times, according to prosecutors. Wallace and Ortiz, who were also charged with murder, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. What's next for Aaron Hernandez? Rosalie Oliver -- the juror who hadn't heard of Hernandez before the trial -- said that, for her, the first shot was enough. \"There was no need for the other five,\" she said. \"One shot for me is cruelty.\" Oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict. \"Who won?\" she asked \"Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?\" What prison life will be like for Aaron Hernandez . Oliver recalled making eye contact with Hernandez at one point during the months-long trial. \"He actually nodded to me one time,\" she said. \"You come in that room every day and you see this person and it's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it's almost like they're part of you. And then, all of a sudden now, you've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go.\" The jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room, choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial. They conveyed a sense of gravity about their task. \"You see, you know, 'Law & Order' and all these different TV shows and it's just nothing like that at all. It's just very serious,\" Carlson said. 5 things to know about the jury .",

Sudan is guarded day and night by a group of rangers who risk their lives on a daily basis as they try to keep the rhino from poachers lured by the rising price of ivory. But even without his horn, keepers in the Kenyan reserve of Ol Pojeta in fear for his safety. Scroll down for video . Guard: The rangers keep an armed watch around Sudan at all times to deter poachers after his horn . Extreme measures: Rangers have even cut off the rhino's horn - but they fear it won't be enough . Hungry: Feeding time in Sudan's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a Czech zoo . Dangerous: The rangers are aware they are risking their lives to protect the enormous animal . The 43-year-old rhino - who could live until his 50s - is the last chance for any future northern white rhino calves. Sudan was moved, along with two female rhinos, from a zoo in the Czech Republic in December 2009. The reserve, which specialises in the conservation of rhinos, was chosen because of its successful breeding programme with black rhinos. It had been hoped the move would encourage them to breed, but all attempts have been unsuccessful. The project was dealt a further blow when Suni - the world's only other male, who also lived at Ol Pojeta - died last October. It left just five northern white rhinos in the world - and the three in Kenya are in particular danger. Hunted: Rhinos like Sudan have no predators in the wild because of their size - apart from humans . New home: It had been hoped moving Sudan to Kenya with two females would encourage them to breed . Simor Irungu, one of the rangers who guards Sudan, says the team regularly risk their lives to keep him safe. 'With the rising demand for rhino horn and ivory, we face many poaching attempts and while we manage to counter a large number of these, we often risk our lives in the line of duty.' It is a sad end for a species which used to roam across the heart of Africa - from southern Chad, across the Democratic Republic of Congo and up into Sudan. Just over half a century ago, there were 2,000 northern white rhinos; but 1984 there were only 15, all in the DRC, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But then conservationist managed to bring them back from the brink, and bought the population up to at least 30 animals less than a decade later. Failure: But attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and Sudan is now getting old . High value: The price of ivory is now said to be between \u00a340,000 and \u00a347,000 a kilo . But then poaching took its toll, and the entire park was emptied. The last northern white rhinos were spotted in 2006. Their extinction has been fueled by the growing demand for ivory, which comes in large part from the Far East, where it is believed to be a cure for several ailments. The price for ivory has risen from between \u00a3170 to \u00a3541 per kilo in the 1990s, to today's prices of \u00a340,000 to \u00a347,355 per kilo, according to a report by the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The rangers have taken steps to deter the poachers, but they still fear it may not be enough. Elodie Sampere explained: 'The only reason his horn has been cut off is to deter poachers. 'If the rhino has no horn, he is of no interest to them. 'This is purely to keep him safe.' Sad end: Sudan is one of five northern white rhinos left, and a number of them are his descedents . However, keeping them safe is a costly business: the team of 40 cost \u00a375,000 for six months. It is usually paid for with money made from tourism, but recent instability in Kenya, and fear of Ebola - which is actually thousands of miles away - have kept people away. So the team at \u00a0Ol Pejeta is hoping to raise the money through crowd funding. 'Keeping the ranger team safe is expensive,' the appeal reads. 'They are given world-class training, and are kitted out with the latest in equipment and support, from night vision goggles to GPS tracking, to a team of tracking and support dogs.... 'Keeping the team funded and equipped is an ongoing challenge. 'We are aiming to raise enough to safeguard the wages for the forty strong team for the next six months. 'This is \u00a375,000. Any which way, every single pound contributed will help secure the rangers, that secure the rhino, for us and for future generations.' To donate, visit Ol Pejeta's GoFundMe page.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA husband was left so traumatised by his wife's botched surgery that he was awarded thousands of pounds in compensation for nervous shock, despite his wife already being given a hefty payout. In a case which could have huge financial consequences for the NHS, Julie Ronayne was awarded \u00a3160,000 after she was left 'looking like Michelin man' following the bungled hysterectomy in 2008. Her husband Edward, who lives with Mrs Ronayne in Netherley, Liverpool, was awarded \u00a39,000 due to the nervous shock he suffered when he saw his wife's appearance. Edward Ronayne was given \u00a39,000 in compensation after he claimed he suffered a psychiatric injury from seeing his wife swell up 'like Michelin man' after botched surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital (pictured) The severe swelling had been caused by a dangerous infection known as peritonitis, which the woman had contracted during the surgery at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation. The test case, being heard at London's Appeal Court, could set a significant precedent about who is able to claim for shock or distress following an NHS mishap. Mr Ronayne was awarded the damages from\u00a0Liverpool Women\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust in July 2013. Liverpool County Court heard how he had been a 'secondary victim' of the incident and had suffered psychiatric injury caused by the shock of seeing his wife's new appearance. He had described her 'colloquially as looking like a Michelin man', the court heard. Mr Ronayne also described his wife's first two days in hospital as 'the worst days of my entire life'. He said he had been 'brought up not to complain' but had never fully recovered from the sight. He added that he had been left feeling tearful, overwhelmed, angry and powerless. The judge, who described him as 'an honest and reliable witness', said: 'His symptoms...were pathological and went beyond simply the distress and anger that a man would suffer due to the near terminal illness of his wife.' But in the appeal court today,\u00a0Charles Cory-Wright QC, who represents the health trust, told the judges that nervous shock victims are normally only awarded compensation if it can be proved that they have been left with psychiatric injury. He said Mr Ronayne's win had moved the goalposts drastically and could lead to a flood of similar claims, costing the cash-strapped NHS millions in compensation. The barrister argued that Mr Ronayne would not have suffered a sufficient level of shock to qualify for compensation. He added that he was visiting his wife in hospital and therefore would have expected her to look unwell. He told the court: 'Hospitals on a day-to-day basis deal with people who are ill or vulnerable. They go there followed by their loved ones. It is unfortunately a matter of day-to-day occurrence that great emotional responses will take place in a hospital. The NHS is now fighting to overturn the payout, fearing it could have disastrous consequences for the organisation if Mr Ronayne is allowed to keep the money. The test case is being heard at the appeal court . 'The question arises more and more often in cases like this as to whether those relatives have a claim.' Stressing the importance of the appeal, he told the judges: 'This appeal is not just about this case, but the concerns NHS Trusts have about claims being brought on a secondary basis where clinical negligence has taken place. Peritonitis is caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the stomach. It is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis requires immediate treatment and is a medical emergency. Most cases of peritonitis are the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix or digestive disorders. Peritonitis can be fatal and needs to be treated quickly to avoid such complications. Source: NHS . 'The effect of this judgement, if it stands, is to alter the effect of the law in secondary victim cases, as the award was made absent any evidential basis that the secondary victim suffered any psychiatric injury as a result of shock. 'Often emotional illness follows, but there is not the necessary element of shock. There needs to be a suddenly shocking event which, because of its shocking nature, causes that psychiatric illness. That is often lost in the wash in these cases.' But Lord Justice Sullivan said the incident had no doubt been 'shocking' 'Simply going into hospital and seeing one's loved ones and family looking peaky is not enough,' he said. 'But to see one's wife looking like the Michelin man is shocking.' Mr Cory-Wright then replied: 'If you saw your loved one looking like the Michelin man, swollen and all that, it would be shocking in an ordinary sense. 'But it would not be shocking in the sense of being suddenly overwhelmed so as to lead to psychiatric injury.' The judges recognised the importance of the case by reserving their decision on the trust's appeal until a later date. The case was heard in front of Lord Justice Sullivan, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Beatson. Mrs Ronayne went on to make a good recovery.",

Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of Kiraz held during the armed siege last week. Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. The prosecutor, identified by state television as Kiraz, was shot in the head during the stand-off and rushed to hospital where doctors tried to save his life. Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and hospital officials later announced he had died. Private news agency Dogan reported police special forces had entered the building, which was evacuated. It was not clear how the assailants managed to get arms into the courthouse. Mr Kiraz was the prosecutor investigating the death of a teenager who was hit by a police gas canister fired during nationwide anti-government protests in 2013. The DHKP-C, which seeks a socialist state, has carried out sporadic attacks, including a suicide bombing on the US Embassy in 2013 that killed a security guard.

Local media said a man was also held . Just one day after the death of Kiraz, a woman armed with guns and hand grenades was shot dead as she tried to attack Istanbul's police headquarters. A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged and television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood. 'The Istanbul police headquarters on Vatan street was targeted by rifle fire and a female terrorist was killed in the clash,' the Istanbul governor's office said in a statement at the time. The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained. On the same day police separately detained a gunman who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added. It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election.",

The 32-mile hike took weeks to complete but even then their journey was far from over. At the end of the trail they staggered into Bennett, a makeshift city of tents, hotels and saloons at the head of a deep green fjord, where they settled for a brief respite. All that is left of Bennett today is its split-log chapel and station, still used by the White Pass Railway. 'On May 29, 1898 more than 7,000 roughly hewn rafts set sail,' Keith told me. 'There was a further 400 miles of hazardous waterways, canyons and rapids to negotiate before they reached their goal.' Everything in the Yukon is of epic proportions. Bordering Alaska, it is almost twice the size of Britain, with ranges of sparkling snow-crusted peaks, emerald lakes and vast forests. There are few signs of habitation in this pristine wilderness, with only a few roads linking the small communities. Spectacular snowfield: Wendy flew over the world's largest non-polar icefield in the Kluane National Park . Distances between them are mind-boggling. Locals travel up to 100 miles for their weekly shop, and some days I drove for seven or eight hours along deserted highways, rarely passing another vehicle. In the Kluane National Park, I took a scenic flight over the world's largest non-polar icefield. We skimmed barren hillsides, almost touching the curly-horned Dall's sheep balanced on the rocky outcrops. As we soared higher, I looked down on immense snowfields before we swooped over glaciers. Kluane is home to a huge grizzly bear population, so one morning I set off in search of them with retired ranger Brent Liddle and his dog Blue. Carrying pepper spray for protection, he led me around a beautiful turquoise lake and up towards the saddle of King's Throne Mountain. Clapping hands to warn of our presence, we scrambled along a rocky path, stepping over tangled roots and clambering over fallen logs. Kluane is home to a huge grizzly bear population (left). Right, some of the original Gold Rush prospectors . Suddenly Brent pointed to a spruce tree. The bark was worn away and fresh hairs were glued to the sap. 'A bear has been rubbing his head and back here,' he explained. Eyes darting in all directions, we proceeded cautiously but there was no sign of the grizzly. I was quite relieved. In fact I saw more wildlife along the roadside than I did on foot, sometimes stopping the car only yards from black bears guzzling on dandelions among carpets of fireweed and blue lupins. At Tombstone Territorial Park we pulled in to watch caribou grazing on the tundra and beavers paddling to their lodge, mouths crammed with twigs. Unless you stay at one of the designated campsites, accommodation in the parks is limited. My favourite was the Tagish Wilderness Lodge - a speedboat whisks you across a lake on a 45-minute journey from the nearest road. Four log cabins are hidden in the trees, yards from the water's edge. The main building consists of a spacious living area decorated with moose and caribou antlers, luxury bathrooms and a pine-scented sauna. Dawson City, epicentre of the Gold Rush, was the largest city in Western Canada back in 1898 . Wendy pans for gold.. and finds a precious nugget . My hosts, Gebhard and Sarah, took me on boat trips along the shoreline and hikes up into the hinterland, passing their heatsensor camera on the way. In the evenings we'd upload the photos showing a lynx, bear and wolf prowling past. I loved the sense of isolation. I spent hours on the jetty watching speckled loons diving for fish. Occasionally a young moose would venture tentatively into the water nearby while bald eagles flew overhead. The views were breathtaking and the silence so intense I could hear a pine needle drop. My last stop was Dawson City, epicentre of the Gold Rush. In 1898 it was the largest city in Western Canada. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it looks much the same, with painted weatherboard houses and wooden boardwalks lining unpaved streets. Archive film in the visitor centre shows the city crowded with prospectors in dark suits and bowler hats. Now the restored buildings stand hugger-mugger with rusty, corrugated-iron shacks sinking slowly into the ground due to the permafrost. Head to Diamond Tooth Gertie's if you want to watch can-can shows or play blackjack with tourists from the cruise ships. I preferred The Pit, the bar in the Westminster Hotel, where I had a beer with locals and listened to live country music. Just a couple of miles away in Bonanza Creek, I met up with Sylvia and her sister, Ginny, who are both descended from an original prospector. Their site at Claim 33 was close to the spot where Skookum Jim made his historic find. Handing me a pan of gravel, Sylvia demonstrated how to sieve and sluice it. As I shook the pan back and forth, dipping it in water to drain off the excess sand, I stopped short. A tiny nugget was glistening in the bottom of the pan. I had found my own crock of gold.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nManchester City are confident UEFA\u2019s punishment for breaching financial fairplay regulations will be lifted this summer which would allow them to bid for stellar names like Raheem Sterling, Gareth Bale, Kevin de Bruyne and Ross Barkley. City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been hampered over the past year by UEFA restricting them to a net transfer spend of \u00a349million in each window and keeping the club\u2019s overall wage bill to its current level of \u00a3205million-a-year. UEFA\u2019s settlement with City published in May stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club\u2019s latest financial figures showed drastically-reduced losses of \u00a323million which they feel proves they are now compliant with FPP regulations. Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by UEFA for a breach of FFP rules will be lifted at the end of this season . Manchester City have been limited to a net spend of \u00a349million in the last two transfer windows - they spent \u00a325m bringing Wilfried Bony in from Swansea in January . Ahead of Monday night\u2019s trip to Crystal Palace, Pellegrini was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing 'crack' players this summer. \u2018I think that next season we don\u2019t have any restrictions so we will be in the same position that all the other English clubs have,\u2019 said Pellegrini. \u2018It\u2019s important. You have so many strong teams here in England and in Champions League, you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money. We spend money, of course we always spend money, but they spent more.\u2019 Manchester United, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than City who were traditionally Europe\u2019s biggest spenders after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. Uefa also ordered City to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the Champions League this season and while that restriction has now ended, any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial. Arsenal have paid more in transfer fees than City in the last 12 months, including \u00a330m on Alexis Sanchez . The document published last May by UEFA\u2019s Club Financial Control Body investigative chamber explicitly said City\u2019s financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision. The published statement said at the time: \u2018Manchester City agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. It means City will have to argue their case with Uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year, they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward. They have successfully argued their case with UEFA before. Last summer they persuaded the governing body to allow them to bypass the normal quota of eight homegrown players as their Champions League squad had been reduced. Eliaquim Mangala joined the champions from Porto for \u00a332m last summer . The reigning Premier League champions have only paid money for Fernando, Willie Caballero, Eliaquim Mangala and Wilfried Bony in the last two transfer windows and that was part-paid by the sales of Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell. Pellegrini admitted they weren\u2019t in a position to compete with neighbours United for established world stars like Angel di Maria because of the FFP penalties. It has cost City on the pitch. Even if they win their remaining eight Premier League fixtures their points tally will be lower than last season and they crashed out once again at the last-16 stage of the Champions League. Pellegrini and director of football Txiki Begiristain both accept the squad needs replenishing and they want to be in the market for the top available players. Manchester City have been heavily linked with a move for former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne . The club also want to be involved in any race for Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling . They have been strongly linked with former Chelsea winger Kevin de Bruyne who has been one of the best players in the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg. And if Liverpool do allow Sterling to leave, City want to be involved in the chase for one of England\u2019s most outstanding talents to help fit in with quotas for homegrown players. \u2018If you are the manager or a player of a big tem, you are always open to criticism because everyone expects a high level of performance,\u2019 he said. \u2018The major issue with our team always seems to be the money but this season I think we were the team that spent less than any other team. That is the weird thing. \u2018For this club trying to be a big team in so few years, maybe we are paying the cost for that.\u2019 Since the transfer penalties were introduced, City have spent \u00a391million on players in the last two windows (Net spend \u00a368million). That compares to Manchester United \u00a3145.5million, Liverpool \u00a3113million, Arsenal \u00a392.5million and Chelsea \u00a382.6million. Over the same time period Barcelona spent \u00a3118.3million on players and Real Madrid \u00a381.2million though they also broke the world transfer record for Gareth Bale the previous summer.",

If convicted he faces 20 years' jail in the US. Dr Adam Cobb was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography\u00a0after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr . The 45-year-old was in the US working as a research professor and director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island. Cobb took up the position at the US Naval War College in June last year after holding senior military and government roles in Australia and the US, including a recent strategic policy and planning position at US Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. 'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr. The internet connection at Cobb's Portsmouth home was identified as the origin of the images. Cobb was in the US working as a  director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island\u00a0after holding senior military and government roles in Australia, including the RAAF . Laptops and mobile phones were seized from his home, while photos and videos of two females were also discovered on a storage device and a computer allegedly belonging to Cobb. Educated at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and University of Cambridge, Cobb built a reputation as a leading military thinker. According to his biography on the US Naval War College website, Cobb worked on the 1999-2000 East Timor crisis with Major General Cosgrove, who at the time was commander of the international peacekeeping mission. 'Overall, my commanders and I found Dr Cobb's work a valuable contribution to our understanding of important issues before us,' Maj Gen Cosgrove wrote in a review of Cobb's work as lead analyst for the Australian Parliament Defence Office. In Australia he was special-director, strategic policy with the RAAF; senior defence adviser for the Australian parliament; an Australian parliamentary fellow; and research fellow at Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre. Cobb has also worked at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC and was on the staff of former speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

When a high-profile vicar yesterday attacked the Tory plans to sell housing association homes as a \u2018right to steal\u2019, it might have sounded like a stern ticking off from the pulpit. But this was the Rev Richard Coles \u2013 who sits on the board of Wellingborough Homes, a housing association in Northamptonshire \u2013 and he is no ordinary churchman. Known to many for presenting Radio 4\u2019s gentle human interest show Saturday Live, he is the supposed inspiration for the hero of the BBC church sitcom Rev. And while he might now feel free to attack others for seeking the right to buy their own home, he not so long ago felt he had the right to do whatever he chose himself, regardless of the law or anyone else\u2019s feelings. For Coles raised eyebrows by last year publishing a frank memoir which detailed not only his rise to fame as half of the famously gay 1980s pop band The Communards, alongside singer Jimmy Somerville, but also his enthusiasm for \u2018dogging\u2019 \u2013 having sex with strangers in the open air \u2013 and for taking drugs including cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines. He also confessed that he falsely told his friends that he was HIV positive, to generate attention and sympathy, and kept up the unpleasant pretence for five years. Coles, 52, is now a regular on TV and radio, but on Sundays he performs at his 14th century parish church, St Mary the Virgin, in Finedon, Northamptonshire. He lives nearby in a \u2018rather lovely\u2019 grace and favour vicarage provided by the Church of England. Last October he warned his parishioners to \u2018brace themselves\u2019 for the publication of his biography Fathomless Riches, and said shortly after: \u2018I hadn\u2019t realised quite how eventful my life had been until I sat down to write about it. The truth is, country parsons often have a more vivid past than you might think.\u2019 Born in Northamptonshire to shoemaker parents, Coles was sent to public school and it was while he was a chorister there that he realised he was gay. Coles, 52, is now a regular on TV and radio, but on Sundays he performs at his 14th century parish church, St Mary the Virgin, in Finedon, Northamptonshire . Within a few years he had taken a drug overdose, saying that in the 1970s being gay \u2018was like being a paedophile now \u2013 it was a life which seemed to offer only disgrace\u2019. He moved to London, however, met Somerville, and they formed The Communards. Their song Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way went to number one and was the best-selling single of 1986. Money poured in. But Coles remained unhappy, jealous of Somerville\u2019s fame and feeling geeky himself. He took large quantities of drugs, apparently spending a whole year in Ibiza on speed and ecstasy, and taking LSD. He believes the ecstasy was sometimes laced with heroin. He eventually conquered his shyness with other men when he discovered a lay-by where he could meet strangers and have sex in the woods at night. He described the discovery of this dogging spot as \u2018one of the great liberations of my life. Having lots of casual and anonymous sex with strangers\u2019. He added: \u2018It was extremely healing for me. Would I repudiate it? No. I had a fantastic time.\u2019 After a theology degree Coles was ordained in 2005 and says he now leads a celibate life with his civil partner David Oldham, 37, a curate in a neighbouring parish.",

Grant Clarke, 45, suffered a brain haemorrhage in May 2012. It left him paralysed on his left side, incontinent and unable to swallow or communicate . Vanessa Kennard, one of the nurses caring for Mr Clarke at the West Kent Neuro-rehabilitation unit at Sevenoaks Hospital, has been suspended from her role for six months after being charged with misconduct . His family became concerned when they visited him at the West Kent Neuro-rehabilitation unit and discovered he smelled of urine and was becoming more and more depressed. His partner Binny Moore planted a secret camera in an iPod docking station. The footage captured revealed the shocking extent of neglect Mr Clarke was subjected to. It showed him looking on helplessly as one nurse dug into his feeding tubes with a biro pen, while another clip showed Ms Kennard pulling a help buzzer from his hands. Mr Clarke, a former IT company director, was also subjected to 'appalling' treatment and left in urine-soaked sheets, covered in faeces. Staff at the rehabilitation unit were also shown giving Mr Clarke drinks, despite him being strictly nil by mouth. When Ms Moore attempted to speak to a nurse about her partner's 'unacceptable care' she was allegedly told, 'point taken, but do bear in mind that we have eight other patients'. Mr Clarke, from West Kingsdown, was only moved to another unit after his family showed the footage to police, and he was removed from the unit under a court order.

Ms Kennard faced 10 counts, including the removal of Mr Clarke's help buzzer, and telling Ms Moore her partner was too 'buzzer happy'. Concerned that Mr Clarke was being mistreated, his partner Binny Moore and family planted a secret camera in his room. It captured footage of Ms Kennard and colleagues failing to provide the accepted standard of care for Mr Clarke. One nurse was filmed cleaning his feeding tube with a pen, pictured .

The panel imposed an interim six-month suspension order in her absence. Deputy ward manager Ms Banwell admitted 13 charges but denies nine others - including one of cleaning the patient's feed tube with a biro pen. Ms Coulter, a ward manager, has admitted 13 charges and denies four others. The two-week fitness to practise hearing has concluded and the panel is still considering the cases against Ms Coulter and Ms Banwell. Mr Clarke's family complained to the trust 26 times - 22 of which were upheld.

A storm can have hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres. The method could provide a novel way to understand thunderclouds . The experiment was conducted using the Lofar (Low-Frequency Array) radio telescope in the Netherlands. Researchers found, almost by accident, that cosmic rays were a suitable probe to measure electric fields within thunderclouds. High in the atmosphere, the rays strike atmospheric molecules and create \u2018showers\u2019 of elementary particles - the smallest known to exist. A long-standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high-energy particles from space that hit Earth. Called cosmic rays, they're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at Cern's Large Hadron Collider. They strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles, mostly muons, electrons and photons, over a wide area. Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovae, but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well. These showers can be measured from the radio emissions that are generated when they interact with Earth\u2019s magnetic field. By measuring this during a thunderstorm, the researchers found they could find out information about the electric field in a thundercloud as it affected the radio emissions. It was found to be as strong as 50 kilovolts per one metre (3.3ft) - which translates into a voltage of hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres, an enormous amount of energy. 'We modeled how the electric field in thunderstorms can explain the different measurements,\u2019 said researcher Dr Pim Schellart from Radboud University in the Netherlands. \u2018This worked very well. How the radio emission changes gives us a lot of information about the electric fields in thunderstorms. \u2018We could even determine the strength of the electric field at a certain height in the cloud.\u2019 Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovae (illustrated), but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well . Lightning is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims many victims around the world each year. This new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity. Current measurement methods from planes, balloons or little rockets are dangerous and too localised. Most importantly, the presence of the measurement equipment influences the measurements too. Cosmic rays probe the thunderclouds from top to bottom. Moving at almost the speed of light they provide a near instantaneous 'picture' of the electric fields in the cloud. Moreover, they are created by nature and are freely available. 'This research is an exemplary form of interdisciplinary collaboration between astronomers, particle physicists and geophysicists', said Dr Heino Falcke, also from Radboud University. 'We hope to develop the model further to ultimately answer the question: how is lightning initiated within thunderclouds?' Lightning (shown in Utah) is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims victims around the world. This new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity .",

The Blues are preparing for Wednesday night's trip to Leicester City at St George's Park, having drawn criticism for the way they ground out a decisive 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday. And Drogba and his team-mates, who can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more victories, have shown off their abilities with an intricate six-man heading trick around the dinner table. Didier Drogba hit back at claims that Chelsea were boring with a video of them completing a 'bin challenge' After the ball is headed by Loic Remy and Eden Hazard, John Terry heads to Drogba in the six-man task . After Drogba, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is the next to take the ball, heading back to John Obi Mikel . Mikel stoops with a diving header that sees him fall off his chair, but the ball does drop into the small bin . Manager Jose Mourinho shot back at claims that his side were boring this week, insisting that going 10 years without winning the league - as Arsenal have - was more boring, and now Drogba has added to the retort with a video captioned: 'Boring boring chelseaaaa!!!!!!' With six players seated opposite each other on either side of a long table, Branislav Ivanovic throws the ball on to the head of Loic Remy to start the game. He heads back to Eden Hazard, who then directs it on to John Terry followed by Drogba and Thibaut Courtois before John Obi Mikel stoops to knock the ball into a bin with a diving header. After just about managing to complete the feat all seven players celebrate wildly, the sort of scenes that might be seen against Crystal Palace on Sunday if Chelsea win at the King Power Stadium and then on their return to Stamford Bridge. The champions-elect have been preparing for Wednesday night's game at the National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent since Monday, where they are staying at the on-site Hilton Hotel. While French forward Remy was more than willing to jump around with his team-mates in the video at the hotel, he has been ruled out of the game against Leicester by  Mourinho. With Mikel on the floor, Courtois and Terry leap into the air in celebrations that could soon be repeated . The seven players involved in the game at St George's Park jump around in a celebratory huddle . Drogba and his team-mates can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more league victories . Diego Costa is also a doubt having missed almost a month of action with a hamstring problem that has bugged him for much of the season. Midfielder Oscar has a chance of returning from the concussion he suffered against Arsenal in a challenge by goalkeeper David Ospina on Sunday. St George's Park, which opened in October 2012, is used by the full range of England teams as well as club sides. Barcelona, Galatasaray and Monaco are among the visiting teams to have stayed there. Terry and his team-mates celebrate at full-time at the Emirates Stadium after stepping closer to the title .",

The man accused of shooting two police officers during a demonstration in Ferguson has confessed to the crime in a series of phone calls from jail that were recorded. Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief. All inmates are informed their phone conversations while behind bars are recorded and can be used as evidence against them, but despite the warning Williams spoke freely about the incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center. In a conversation with his girlfriend, Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD on the night of the shooting . 'Nobody aiming at no police,' Williams said. 'I ran up the hill and he (an unidentified person) shot at the car. ... I shot back,' Williams said in the recordings first obtained by KMOV-TV. In another conversation, Williams expressed concern about a possible lengthy prison sentence. 'Even though I was in the wrong, though, I should have just went the other way,' he said. 'Oh man, now I'm looking at 10 years.' Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest. Despite being warned that phone calls from prison can be used as evidence, Jeffrey Williams, 20, spoke freely about the March 12 incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center . Christmas told The Associated Press on Wednesday morning he hadn't heard the audio of the phone conversations, but he stood by what Williams told him. 'My client has maintained to me that he never fired a gun that night,' Christmas said. 'So until I'm able to see evidence that I can distinctly talk to him about, I have to maintain my commitment to the statements that he has made to me.' Christmas was also critical of the justice center for releasing audio that provides potential evidence against Williams. Ferguson has been a focal point since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. A grand jury in November declined to indict the former officer, Darren Wilson, who also was cleared of civil rights violations by the U.S. Department of Justice in March. Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD and wasn't aiming at the cops. He also expressed remorse . Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest . But a separate DOJ report found widespread racial bias in Ferguson's policing efforts and the municipal court system, which it said was driven by profit mostly extracted from black and low-income residents. Several city officials were fired or resigned following the report. Among those was Police Chief Tom Jackson, and his resignation led several dozen people to protest outside of police headquarters. The demonstration was about to break up when shots rang out. A St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder; a Webster Groves officer was hit in the face. Both are expected to fully recover.",

Nick Cousins, 57, and Grace Garcia Cousins, 53, were held over alleged 'ill treatment' of their child after it emerged that her birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, were never registered and they did not attend school. The couple were also being questioned by police over claims that Filipino Mrs Cousins had overstayed her visa. The 15-year-old daughter of Briton Nick Cousins (left) and his partner Grace (right) fell to her death\u00a0from their multi-million pound flat in Hong Kong . Police said the girl, Blanca Cousins (right) had been unhappy and a police source said she locked herself in a bathroom before falling to her death as her parents tried to unlock the door . Police sources say Blanca (pictured) was watching television in the apartment's master bedroom while her parents watched TV in the living room shortly before the tragedy . A police spokeswoman said a security guard found Blanca lying on the ground at the foot of the apartment block shortly after 1.46am . Tragedy: Blanca fell to her death in an apparent suicide early on Tuesday morning after locking herself in a bathroom of the apartment in Hong Kong's exclusive 3 Repulse Bay Road (pictured) Mr Cousins, originally from Thurrock, Essex, is managing director of the Hong Kong arm of international insurance broking firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson, and has worked for the firm in Asia for more than 20 years. There were claims last night that Mrs Cousins had originally moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s and worked as a domestic helper before becoming the partner of Mr Cousins. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname. It is believed the couple had been watching television in the family's home on the 21st floor of one of Hong Kong's most luxurious apartment buildings before Blanca's mother found her daughter was locked in a bathroom shortly before 2am. Blanca fell to her death from a window just before dawn. Paramedics declared her dead at the foot of the building in Repulse Bay. Police sources claimed while no suicide note had been found they were aware the girl had been 'unhappy' in recent weeks. The girl's father has been named as Nick Cousins (pictured)\u00a0the managing director of insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson's Hong Kong office . Blanca \u2013 who was known as Blancs \u2013 was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July. She was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and was understood to have been educated at a private tuition centre along with her younger sister. School attendance is mandatory in Hong Kong, but a more relaxed approach is taken with expatriate residents and some 'home school' their children without official permission. However, not having their births registered meant the girls would not have been able to get either compulsory identity cards or passports to pass through the territory's strictly controlled borders, which suggests they spent their entire lives in Hong Kong. Last night, one expat who knows Mr Cousins described the family as 'down to earth and decent'. He added: 'He isn't a Hooray Henry at all, like so many of the expats in top jobs in Hong Kong. He's more of an Essex-boy type who worked his way up the corporate ladder and is just very bright and very good at what he does.' Both of the Cousins girls appeared to have a wide circle of friends among the city's well-to-do expatriate community. Carla Cousins \u2013 Blanca's younger sister \u2013 recently posted pictures on Facebook revealing that her father had a company box at last month's Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and invited friends to join her at the event.

The 21-storey apartment is one of the wealthy city's most prestigious addresses with luxury four-bedroom apartments selling for prices in the region of \u00a37.5million . A police source last night said: 'Initial investigations showed there were no suspicious circumstances and [Blanca] was suspected to have fallen from a height. 'We arrested a 53-year-old Filipino female for overstaying and a 58-year-old British male for aiding and abetting an overstayer. 'Both have also been arrested for suspected ill treatment of the girl. Our investigations indicate the girl was unhappy with her life.' Last night a spokesman for the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group said: 'We can confirm that our colleague Nick Cousins, the managing director of our Hong Kong office, has suffered the loss of his eldest daughter in tragic circumstances. We are giving Nick our full support through this difficult time and he will be on compassionate leave until further notice. 'We are aware that the authorities are investigating a number of matters that have come to light in the wake of this tragic event. As these are private matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. 'Our thoughts are with Nick and his family.'

Valdosta State University found itself in the center of a controversy after a video shared on social media showed an Air Force veteran and former Playboy model, Michelle Manhart, taking an American flag from demonstrators who had walked on it to protest racism. At the protest, held a week ago, Manhart was detained by police when she refused to return the flag. Big rally: Flag supporters attend a rally on Friday in Valdosta, Georgia that caused the Valdosta State University to close down for the day .

Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia . Hunt:\u00a0Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus . She later was banned from the campus of 11,500 students. She was not a student at Valdosta State, according to the school. The flag-walking demonstration involved three protesters, university spokesman Andy Clark said. Meanwhile, tensions rose at Valdosta State when campus police found a backpack containing a handgun on Tuesday. Police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration, and they issued a warrant for Eric Sheppard's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus. Sheppard fled and has not been found by authorities, Clark said. Flag supporters gathered for a rally Friday afternoon, and university administrators said the possibility of thousands of people rallying on the outskirts of campus ultimately led to the decision to give students a day off. 'That level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city,' Clark said. 'We're from an overall safety perspective looking to close the campus down today so they can have a peaceful rally.' Organizers of the 'Flags Over VSU' rally said they expected as many as 4,000 people Friday afternoon, WALB-TV reported . University administrators arranged for extra police to be on campus to provide security during the rally, Clark told The Valdosta Daily Times. Local law enforcement officials said the crowd that gathered was generally peaceful. Pro-flag: A flag supporter waves a large American flag while attending a rally on Friday in support of the flag . In support: Flag supporters on motorbikes attend a rally on Friday in support of Michelle Manhart . University administrators faced a backlash on social media after Manhart was issued a criminal trespass warning, essentially banning her from campus. Critics saw the university as siding with demonstrators who walked on the flag over a military veteran trying to save it. 'We were protecting their right to free speech and civil liberties' without taking sides, Clark said. NBC reports that some people T-shirts with the American flag and the words 'Try walking on this flag' written on the back and others carried signs. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition . NBC spoke with Kim Thompson who drove 30 miles to join in the rally. 'I think it's going to be amazing. I think it's actually going to be part of history,' she said. Thompson, the wife of a sailor, said that after September 11 she became more patriotic than ever and felt that she needed to speak up after watching the flag get trampled. Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators last week. Video footage of the event, last Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don\u2019t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn\u2019t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I\u2019m not fighting against them. I\u2019m fighting against the way they are going about it.' Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above . Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread . According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service . She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition - \u00a0and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country. 'While I firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters, I understand their right to protest.'",

Beth is seen getting her nursing degree above . In an interview with Today, Brendan once again praised his wife. 'She was so powerful,' he said. 'Most people, up until very recently, didn't even know she was sick, even though she'd been through multiple surgeries and [chemotherapy] treatments. She always had a positive outlook. She always cared more for everybody else first.' He also said that in addition to writing her obituary she planned the entire funeral so no one else would have to worry about anything after she was gone. Now family members have set up a\u00a0GoFundMe page\u00a0to try and fund her children's education, and help out Brendan, who met his wife when the two were just 14-years-old. Already $30,000 has been raised, with the hopes of making it to $100,000 from Brendan and the children. 'This is a story about a love that will live forever and will never fade or waver,' the page says of Beth. 'Her love is like the wind, we can't see it but we can feel it every single day.' I died Thursday, April 16, 2015 surrounded by family, in the arms of my husband and anam cara, Brendan Patrick O'Rourke. I was 44 years old. I was a survivor. I was blessed in this life with two amazing children; Courtney Elizabeth age 11 and Seamus Brendan aged 8. I was a Burncoat girl, raised by my mother, Eileen (Courtney) Rafferty now of Holden, and my very dear uncle, George 'David' Rafferty who predeceased me. Henry J Rafferty was my father who also predeceased me. I also leave my brother Sean P. Rafferty, sisters: Noreen Erickson and her husband Robert, Ellen R Harrity and Megan Rafferty, all of Worcester. I leave a most loving mother and father in law, James G. and Hannah 'Joan' O'Rourke; a sister, Colleen and her husband, Martin Dyer all of Worcester; a brother-in-law, James O'Rourke and his wife, Michelle (Holden) and lifelong friends Carrie Ann Buccaglia (Worcester), Maureen Grenier (Dudley), Patricia Flagg (Millbury), and many nieces and nephews. I'd like to thank my colleague, physician and dear friend Venu Bathini MD, for his care and support in this battle. You always saw me as a person and not a statistic. In addition I thank my PCP Elizabeth Murphy MD, nurses Beth and Faith and all those who cared for me during this journey. It was not easy for me to be a care receiver, but we forged a path for me that brought me further than most would have imagined. I attended Burncoat High School, Worcester State University obtaining my masters in nursing. As a 'roaming' catholic I attended Mass in various parishes. We are members of St Columba but attended St. Johns, Our Lady of the Angels and the Abbey in Spencer. Nursing was my calling, during my career I had the honor and privilege, to care for patients who were amazing people; they often gave me the strength and courage to get through my journey and the desire to return to the work of caring for others. I hope I was able to give them a fraction of what they gave me. I LOVED my life. I loved a long run, to sit quietly by the lake, to read and dance and sing and be silly with our children. We loved watching summer storms blow across the water. I loved to chat and laugh with my sisters and friends, until tears ran down our legs! Brendan and I enjoyed many trips together, most enjoyable were those to Ireland, visiting family to share a pint and some good 'craic'. And of course sitting quietly on the porch with Brendan (listening to the Red Sox). I enjoyed working for a cause, among them, the Pancreatic Cancer Alliance, whose members' spirit and dedication amazed me. Of all the things I did in this life, nothing compared to being with Brendan and our children. I fought every day to stay alive and to be with them. No person could ever ask for a more loving and supportive husband, always my champion, always. I enjoyed every moment we shared; the great ones, the sad ones, the easy and the hard. I pray they have learned to feel the deep sense of faith that I shared. No matter where this journey brings me next, I will forever carry their love with me, as I am sure there is a piece of me that will forever remain with them. But cancer does not care who it takes, who it hurts, or honor or love. It comes into your life and starts to break the threads that hold you and you are left to see pieces of yourself slip away and dreams fade. We were clung only to each other with pure love and faith binding us, in the end is when the most amazing thing happens, cancer loses its strength and grace appears. We need to see it. We accept it, and go with it. Grace and love win, not cancer. I hope to be remembered, with laughter, love and a good pint. And for my children to know \"No Momma ever did and no Momma ever will\u2026..\" Family and friends will gather to honor and remember my life at calling hours on Tuesday, April 21, 2015 from 4:00 to 8:00 pm at Heald & Chiampa Funeral Directors \u2013 The Sumner House, 5 Church Road, On the Common, Shrewsbury Center. My Funeral Mass will be celebrated in Saint John's Church, 44 Temple Street, Worcester on Wednesday, April 22nd at 10 a.m. Burial will follow in Mooreland Cemetery, Paxton. Honor my legacy and love for my children with a donation to Our Story of Love  or become involved and help fight cancer in any way you can. Forgive someone today and fill that spot with love.",

For 87 straight days, oil and methane gas spewed from an uncapped wellhead, 1 mile below the surface of the ocean. The federal government estimated 4.2 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf, but BP argued in court that it was much lower. A judge ruled BP was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels. Imagining Daddy: A rig worker's daughter and her dreams . There were dire predictions of what would follow. Environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale. Scientists continue to study environmental impacts, but five years after the spill, the long-term negative effects remain unclear and are, in many cases, highly disputed. BP, the company that caused the spill, is eager to point out it appears the Gulf of Mexico is healing itself. BP's vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, said there is no doubt birds, fish, turtles, sub-sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. \"There's no question about that,\" Morrell said. \"But they have also, according to the data, bounced back and are recovering strongly.\" \"And there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\" While BP's assessment has not been disproven, the government suggests it's too soon to make long-term conclusions about the rebounding health of the Gulf. Shortly after BP released its own five-year report that concluded the Gulf has largely recovered, the trustees of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment called BP's report \"inappropriate as well as premature.\" The trustees, a collection of government agencies tasked with determining the extent of the damage from the Macondo spill, released a statement, saying, \"We know that the environmental effects of this spill are likely to last for generations.\" One government official familiar with the trustee's assessment accused BP of having \"cherry-picked\" positive results while ignoring others, something BP denies. Most long-term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed. Studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill, but others show some of those species are bouncing back. Fish landings in the Gulf, the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry, have returned. Oysters are also recovering in many areas. And according to the Food and Drug Administration, tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region's food supply. The spill's effects on other species are less clear. Dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the Gulf Coast, and even more so in Louisiana where the oil hit the hardest. But the dolphin \"mortality event,\" as the government calls it, began months before the spill. Studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like Barataria Bay, Louisiana, could be caused by oil exposure, but direct links to the 2010 Macondo spill have not been proven. Seaside sparrows in the Gulf are also showing signs of strain, and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance. While aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters, government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long-term effects on sea turtle populations. But perhaps the greatest unknown is what, if anything, millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the Gulf itself. Oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the Macondo well as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean. Mandy Joye, an oceanographer with the University of Georgia, has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled. Her research and other studies show BP's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor. According to Joye's study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others. Joye is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor -- estimated to be about 10 million gallons -- affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean. \"That stuff's not going to stay put. It's going to move around, \" Joye said. She said that right now, there is just no way to tell if it will have an impact. \"There's so much that we don't know,\" Joye said. BP doesn't accept the results of Joye's work. The company said its oil is all accounted for and only exists in two places: within a 2 kilometer area around the wellhead and in tar mats and tar balls that have yet to be cleaned up on the beach. And according to BP's Morrell, the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful. \"So much time has passed that it no longer has any toxicity and is therefore not a threat to humans or aquatic life,\" Morrell said. Ocean conservationist Philippe Cousteau witnessed much of the spill's aftermath in 2010, but when he returned to the Gulf to dive near an oil rig last month, he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks, hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw. During the same trip, however, Cousteau spotted a mother dolphin trying to revive a dead calf. It is unknown if its death had anything to do with the oil. Cousteau commended the progress community groups and restoration projects have made since the spill, but he said he believes it's far too early to say the Gulf is back and the oil is gone. \"It is still in many cases in the sand, along the shoreline, in the marshes,\" Cousteau said, \"and existing on a microscopic scale that we may not be able to see with the naked eye.\" CNN's David Matthews contributed to this report.",

'I think this club will eventually be a very big one, but it's going to take time and probably not over the next couple of years,' he said. 'It is going to take a lot of hard work by everybody, but I wouldn't have signed a new contract if I didn't think we could achieve something to get into the top tier of English football.

West Ham United players Diafra Sakho, Winston Reid and Mark Noble poses for photographers outside the Olympic Stadium the club are set to move in to in 2016-17 . Reid added: 'One of the reasons (I signed) was that I could see myself as an important part of the squad for the next six years of my career. 'My family are happy here; I have a good relationship with the people at the club and most importantly I wanted to give something back to a club that took a chance on me. 'I took all those factors into consideration and footballing-wise I really do believe we can achieve something. 'I am not saying we are going to win the league, that's probably not realistic, but to win something and get into that upper tier would be an achievement.'",

Pep Guardiola, whose side were outplayed in Portugal on Wednesday, remains Manchester City's first choice to replace under-fire Manuel Pellegrini.

That would work for City. While current manager Pellegrini has a year remaining on his own deal, he has come in for fierce criticism following the stunning collapse of City's Premier League title defence and appears to be waiting for the knockout punch to land. But is Guardiola the right man for the job? The boy from Barcelona is seen as a natural fit given his close relationship with City's executive pair Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, with whom he worked during a glittering stint at the Nou Camp, and his desire to play attractive, attacking football. However, City's Abu Dhabi owners famously crave Champions League progression and, based on recent evidence, there may be some doubt as to whether Guardiola can deliver that. The 44-year-old's early record in the competition is stunning, lifting the trophy two times in three years - although he will not inherit a team featuring the likes of Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi in Manchester. And a glimpse at his away record in the knockout stages of the competition might suggest all is not as it seems. In 17 matches on the road in Europe, Guardiola's teams have won just four times, drawing eight and losing five. He has never exited before the semi-final stage but has twice bowed out to teams deemed inferior. Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in 2010 and Roberto Di Matteo's Chelsea in 2012 would both go on to win the tournament but both were rightly seen as no match for the Catalans before the ties kicked off. Guardiola has a year remaining on his contract but a quarter-final Champions League exit could be a problem . Pellegrini looks set to lose out on the Premier League title and is fighting to qualify for the Champions League . As a player . Barcelona B:\u00a0Segunda Division B . Barcelona: La Liga (6), Copa del Rey (2), Supercopa de Espana (4), European Cup,\u00a0UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, UEFA Super Cup (2) Spain: Olympic Gold Medal . As a manager .

At Bayern, where he pitched up after a year's sabbatical in 2013, the European adventures have been no better. In his first season they saw off a sleepwalking Arsenal side and David Moyes's comatose United before Real Madrid crushed them 5-0 on aggregate including that seismic 4-0 thumping at the Allianz Arena. On Wednesday, another away day defeat left Guardiola on the brink of his earliest exit yet. There may have been mitigation, with the likes of Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery missing but odds of 4-1 for a home win suggested the scale of the offence. Bayern may well turn it around next week and many would hail it as the latest of Guardiola's achievements - and there are many. In his first season at the Nou Camp, where he went from ball boy to legend, Barcelona won every competition they competed in. He lifted 14 trophies during his stint with his hometown club but when he left, while there was plenty of sadness, few did not believe it was the right decision with nemesis Mourinho polishing a first La Liga trophy in four years at the Bernabeu. At Bayern, he lifted the Bundesliga in his first season on a playing field about as level as the nearby Alps and looks set to do so again but will that be enough? Guardiola gives instructions to Bayern Munich's Thomas Muller during their Champions League defeat . Guardiola's teams have won just four times, drawing eight and losing five, in 17 matches away in Europe . If Bayern were to turn it around next week then it would be up there with Guardiola's best achievements . Would Jurgen Klopp, used to grinding out results with less talent at his disposal and suddenly available, be a better candidate? It is unlikely the powers that be at City will think so as, playing style aside, there are other reasons why Guardiola is the preferred choice. As he's shown more than once, Guardiola is not afraid to move big, ageing names on, something that would be music to the ears of the Etihad faithful. At the Nou Camp he showed the likes of Samuel Eto'o, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and none other than a certain Yaya Toure the door. His belief that reputations count for nothing, shared by another manager currently plying his trade in Manchester, could be just what City need. Jurgen Klopp is another who has been linked with a move to the Premier League . The Borussia Dortmund manager confirmed he will be leaving the German club at the end of the season .",

Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles, has documented her changing figure via her Instagram\u00a0page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the mother-to-be came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against her unusually trim and toned figure, claiming it could be doing damage to her unborn child, their comments haven't stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.5 million Instagram followers. Scroll down for video . So soon: Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she is supposed to give birth to her son . Feeling sexy: The 30-year-old mom-to-be celebrated being 38 weeks pregnant by sharing this photo of herself in a gold lam\u00e9\u00a0bikini . Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram on Monday to share a photo of growing belly during her ninth month of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' The snapshot of herself in a bra and thong underwear has been liked nearly 45,000 times since it was posed and has earned nearly 5,000 comments. Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage\u00a0#amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. Baby boy: After posting this bikini photo on Instagram in March, she noted her son is 'growing so much' Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Proud of her bump: Sarah struck various photos for these selfies of herself in her underwear . 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to pregnant Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people noted her son must be as tiny as she is. Bump to bump: Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Just like dad: Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. And when she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the expecting mom has been posting pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. On Wednesday Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refuses to hide her eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Stylish mom: Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Looking good: Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant . She shuns baggy dresses and instead dresses her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah has continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'",

The latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain \u2013 where their country of origin is known \u2013 were born overseas . When Nigel Farage attacked the high cost of health service treatment for foreigners with HIV it was guaranteed to provoke controversy. Instantly the Ukip leader was accused of \u2018dangerous scaremongering\u2019. But, while some of his claims were overstated, the latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain \u2013 where their country of origin is known \u2013 were born overseas. Mr Farage said on Thursday night\u2019s televised debate: \u2018Here\u2019s a fact and I\u2019m sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. \u2018There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. It\u2019s not a good place for any of them to be, I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. \u2018You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to \u00a325,000 a year per patient. \u2018I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband branded the comments \u2018disgusting\u2019 and former England captain Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter: \u2018Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!\u2019 Yesterday Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: \u2018Farage\u2019s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form.\u2019 Mr Miliband also tweeted: \u2018He should be ashamed. The fact he isn\u2019t says so much.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) branded the comments \u2018disgusting\u2019 and former England captain Gary Lineker (right) wrote on Twitter: \u2018Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!\u2019 But last night Mr Farage stood by his claims, telling ITV news they were \u2018cold, hard facts\u2019. The figures on HIV and foreigners are notoriously hard to calculate because they could include British nationals who were born abroad. According to Public Health England, there were 6,000 diagnoses of HIV in the UK in 2013. Where the country of origin is known, 54 per cent of new diagnoses were foreign-born patients. However, the same body estimated that 76 per cent of all newly diagnosed HIV infections among gay or bisexual men and 57 per cent among heterosexual men and women in 2013 probably happened in the UK. The cost of antiretroviral drugs for HIV patients per year has been put between \u00a310,000 and \u00a316,000 by the National Aids Trust. Aids charity Avert has estimated that the cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is around \u00a318,000 per year, although this varies depending on the type and number of drugs taken and the stage of HIV infection. Each HIV patient from overseas \u2013 even if here illegally, a failed asylum seeker or a student on a temporary visa \u2013 is entitled to free treatment on the health service. This \u2018free to all\u2019 policy was introduced in 2012 to try to stop the spread of the virus in the UK. Officials raised concerns about the risk of health tourism by HIV patients in a Department of Health report on their treatment, which was published in 2012 to explain the change in policy. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: \u2018Farage\u2019s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form\u2019 It said: \u2018Given the high cost of ARVs [antiretroviral drugs], for all overseas visitors we recommend that advance prescribing of ARVs is for a maximum of one month in the first instance. \u2018Whilst it is unlikely that people with HIV, or at risk of HIV, will visit the UK solely for the purpose of receiving free HIV treatment, this guidance \u2026 makes clear the arrangements that will enable monitoring to ensure this is not the case.\u2019 Mr Farage\u2019s comments on HIV treatment were believed to be aimed at reviving Ukip\u2019s core vote, as part of a strategy nicknamed \u2018shock and awful\u2019. He had originally intended to warn about the relatively high proportion of migrants with tuberculosis before realising that HIV drugs are more expensive, sources alleged. During the party leaders\u2019 debate, Leanne Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night when she attacked Mr Farage\u2019s comments on HIV treatment. The Conservatives would not go into coalition with Ukip after the election, Michael Gove said yesterday. A day after George Osborne refused to rule out a deal with Nigel Farage, the Tory chief whip told the BBC: \u2018A coalition with Ukip? Nein, danke! Nein, danke is German for No, thank you.\u2019 But Labour said the answer was still not definite enough for them. Andy Burnham has written to David Cameron asking for a cast-iron guarantee there would be no Tory-Ukip coalition. Mr Farage has said he is not interested in a formal coalition. But last night he described the Prime Minister as \u2018somebody we can sit down and talk to\u2019 in the event of a hung parliament. One Ukip condition would be an in/out EU referendum by the end of 2015. She said: \u2018This kind of scaremongering is dangerous, it divides communities and it creates stigma to people who are ill, and I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\u2019 George Osborne, the Chancellor, asked about it afterwards, said that he would \u2018not dignify that with an answer\u2019 and Mr Miliband tweeted yesterday that the comment was \u2018disgusting\u2019. It comes after Ukip\u2019s share of the vote in recent polls has eroded significantly from highs of 19 per cent late last year, to just 10 per cent in several polls over the past month. Mr Farage has claimed he would stand down if he does not win the seat he is contesting in Thanet South. Ukip\u2019s first MP, Douglas Carswell, refused to specifically endorse Mr Farage\u2019s remarks yesterday. The former Conservative, standing in Clacton, Essex, added: \u2018It is sensible and reasonable to say we want a national health service, not an international health service, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u2019 He insisted the party was not split and added: \u2018I thought Nigel was superb in the debates. His answers were credible.\u2019 A half-time poll from ComRes/ITV News showed 24 per cent of voters giving Mr Farage the lead in the debate, but almost as many (22 per cent) thought he was also the worst of the seven leaders. Mr Carswell\u2019s father, Wilson, was a respected physician and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV in Uganda in the 1970s. He was the inspiration for the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan in the Oscar-winning movie The Last King of Scotland. Mr Farage appeared to embarrass Mr Carswell when he won his seat in a by-election in October by calling for a ban on people with HIV entering the UK. Mr Carswell said at the time: \u2018No-one is seriously suggesting we should screen people for HIV coming in.\u2019 Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive of HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \u2018It was great to see so many people express outrage after Farage\u2019s comments last night about the numbers of people in the UK with HIV who were not born here. \u2018HIV is a public health issue in the UK and globally. If we do not take an inclusive approach and provide treatment for people who need it, we will never prevent onward transmission. \u2018HIV doesn\u2019t discriminate and politicians shouldn\u2019t either. Such ill-informed and discriminatory comments generate stigma, and make it harder to encourage people to take a test and stay safe.\u2019 Ed Miliband spoke of himself as a future prime minister ten times during the leaders\u2019 debate on television. In his opening statement, the Labour leader said: \u2018If I\u2019m prime minister, I\u2019ll raise the minimum wage to \u00a38 an hour and ban exploitative zero-hours contracts so we\u2019ll reward hard work again. \u2018If I\u2019m prime minister, I\u2019ll rescue our NHS, hiring more doctors and nurses. \u2018If I\u2019m prime minister, I\u2019ll build a future for all of our young people.\u2019 On migration, he said: \u2018If I\u2019m elected as prime minister, we\u2019ll put in place new rules which say that if you come to this country, you won\u2019t get benefits for at least the first two years.\u2019 On the failure of some employers to pay the minimum wage, he said: \u2018We\u2019ve got to deal with it, and if I\u2019m prime minister, I will.\u2019 Mr Miliband used the words \u2018prime minister\u2019 five more times, including in his summing-up.",

The 37-year-old Rhinos prop had not scored a try for almost 12 months but went over twice in the first half to help the Super League table toppers to their fifth win in a row. Salford's last home win against the Rhinos was a 21-12 Regal Trophy victory at The Willows in November 1993 and their wait goes on after a 28-18 loss. But their depleted side turned in a battling show, trailing 16-12 at half-time, before slipping to only their second defeat in the last eight games. Jamie Peacock broke his try drought with a double for Leeds in their win over Salford on Sunday . Full-back Niall Evalds followed up his two-try show against Wigan with another brace with the Red Devils other touchdown from Lama Tasi. Peacock crossed for his side's first two tries before Ash Handley, the outstanding Rob Burrow and Zak Hardaker went in to seal a hard-fought win in difficult conditions. Salford, already without the suspended Rangi Chase and Weller Hauraki, were shorn of another six regulars but coach Iestyn Harris was not taking the voluntary option to rest any of his players before Saturday's cup tie at Leigh. His hand was forced with Tommy Lee, Kevin Locke, Josh Griffin, Cory Paterson and brothers Jordan and Adam Walne all injured. Harris handed debuts to Under-19 captain Ryan Lannon - cousin of Gareth Hock - and 20-year-old Matty Gee with the back-row pair starting in the bench. Apart from injured wingers Tom Briscoe and Ryan Hall, the Rhinos were also missing Kallum Watkins against the club where he started as a junior, Jamie Jones-Buchanan and Kylie Leuluai. Kevin Sinfield used the strong wind to his advantage from the start with his kick off blowing back to give his side possession. But handling errors by Peacock and Handley gave Salford confidence although Leeds had the first chance to go ahead after 16 minutes. Ben Jones-Bishop spilled a pass in the wind with Danny McGuire pouncing on the loose ball 40 metres out but was hauled down by Theo Fages. The Rhinos did manage to go in front after 22 minutes when Peacock charged over from close range after Salford conceded back-to-back penalties with Sinfield tagging on the conversion. But the Red Devils hit back immediately with Fages' side-stepping run sending sub Tasi over with Michael Dobson's kick levelling the scores. Then Evalds shot through the Leeds defence to fire Salford into a 12-6 lead. Peacock struck again to level at 12-12 after being the quickest to react to McGuire's grubber kick. Salford thought they had regained the advantage four minutes before the break when Hardaker failed to gather Dobson's towering kick in the gale and Scott Taylor collected the ball to race over. But referee Matt Thomason ruled Taylor was offside before he was forced to hold up play when an advertising hoarding blew onto the pitch. The wind then came to the Rhinos aid with kicks by Liam Sutcliffe and Stevie Ward held back by the conditions for Handley to cross in the corner and make it 16-12 at half-time. Handley looked suspiciously offside for his try and it had been a valiant effort by the Red Devils before the break. Leeds have themselves some breathing space early in the second half with Joel Moon slipping two tackles against his old club for the supporting Burrow to scamper over and stretch the lead to 22-12. Salford refused to concede defeat and cut the gap back to four points when Evalds out jumped Handley for his second try from a well judged Dobson kick after 57 minutes. But Salford's elation was short lived when Burrow's burst set up the chance for Hardaker to scythe past Tasi and make it 28-18 on the hour and wrap things up.",

On what is expected to be another unseasonably warm week, forecasters say temperatures in the South could reach  23C (73F) by Wednesday. People have made the most of the sunny weather this weekend by heading to beaches and parks across the UK, with Brighton particularly busy. The best temperatures at 2pm today were 16.2C (61.2F) at Achnagart in the Scottish Highlands, followed by 14.5C (58.1F) in Plymouth, Devon. Scroll down for video .

Meanwhile Ladbrokes has cut its odds on this spring being the warmest on record to 4/6, while it is offering 2/1 on this summer being the hottest ever. Punters can also get 5/1 that the mercury will hit 100F (37.8C) in 2015, or 4/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 will be broken this year. Today will bring cloudy weather for central and eastern Britain with sunny spells and the chance of light showers, but it will be dry and bright elsewhere. And tonight will be fairly cloudy for the centre of the country with the possibility of showers, while most other areas of the UK will be dry with clear spells. Three-day forecast:\u00a0Today will bring cloudy weather for central and eastern Britain with sunny spells and the chance of light showers . Absolutely soaking wet: Daniel Willcox cools down in a fountain at Southsea Splash Pool in Hampshire today . Jogging: A man and woman run through an avenue of cherry trees coming into blossom at Greenwich Park in south-east London today . Forecasters expect the South to reach 17C (63F) tomorrow, 21C (70F) on Tuesday, 23C (73F) on Wednesday and 20C (68F) on Thursday. Tomorrow will see mist and low cloud disperse from most parts of Britain in the morning to leave a bright day with sunny spells and patchy cloud. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said yesterday: 'It is definitely very warm for this time of year as it should be around 12C (54F).' The South East and South West are already on course for their sixth hottest April since records began in 1910, according to Met Office figures. Surface chart: This Met Office graphic shows how high pressure is dominating this weekend in Britain with temperatures in the mid teens . Incoming high tides and strong winds: Five flood alerts are in place today - for Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, Bristol and Cumbria . Some 93 hours of sunshine - up 20 hours on the average - have brightened the UK already this month, but the South West is on flood watch today. Very high tides lashed by strong winds may hit seaside towns and villages along the south Devon coast this weekend, the Environment Agency said. Yesterday\u2019s top temperature in the UK was 17.6C (63.7F) - observed in Achnagart in the Highlands and Pembrey Sands in Carmarthenshire. But that was still some way off last Wednesday\u2019s 2015 UK high of 25.1C (77.1F) in Kent, making it the warmest April day in the UK for four years. Parts of Britain could face a drought as the Met Office cut its rain forecast following last week's heatwave. The unseasonably high temperatures last week saw highs of more than 25C (77F) in the South East - nearly double the average for this time of year. And forecasters warned that initial figures suggest that so far this month Britain has only seen 35 per cent of the average rainfall for April. The dry spell follows months of below-average rainfall and conditions are not expected to bring significant showers before May's arrival. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said: \u2018We are over halfway through the month but we've had around a third of the rainfall we get on average. \u2018Over the next week temperatures are going to stay above average for most parts of the country, with the high pressure lasting until the weekend.\u2019 Weather data for the year so far shows national rain fall has been significantly lower than average nearly every month. The year got off to a soggy start, with January seeing 20 per cent more rain than average but then 13 per cent less than usual fell in February. Last month the figure was 5 per cent below average. The Environment Agency said: \u2018River and groundwater levels across England are healthy.\u2019",

The Barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. TAKING THE BISCUIT . Just a few days ago an old friend of mine Jimmy Carter, the winger who played for Millwall, Liverpool and Arsenal not the US President, visited Barnet and left me a nice packet of milk chocolate biscuits in my office. After training, to help me get rid of them, I decided to give some out to our players. The first seven who walked past my office door were called in for a cup of PG Tips and a chat. I asked each one to take a biscuit and pass the pack on, around the group. I kept repeating it, each time: Take one and pass it on, take one and pass it on. One player didn\u2019t want a biscuit and simply passed the packet on. Martin Allen believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. I stopped them in their tracks and asked him why he hadn\u2019t taken a biscuit. This was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coach\u2019s direction. I didn\u2019t tell them to eat it - I told them to take one and pass the pack on. The other six were looking at their biscuits waiting for the go ahead. I passed the packet back to the player and he now took his biscuit. I let them all know they could eat if they like, and if not return it to my desk, and shook all their hands as they left the room. When it comes to this crucial stage in the season, you need all your troops ready to follow orders. IT\u2019S A ZAYN IF THEY\u2019RE NOT PULLING IN ONE DIRECTION . At whatever level it\u2019s always important to have all your players going in One Direction. Just like the band, if you\u2019ve got one person wanting to go a different way, do a different thing, something is going to crack and the team ethic and unity will be broken. At the business end of the season, it is so important that they are working as a team. People have to do their jobs; defending set plays, defensive shape when you\u2019re attacking, working up and down the pitch. You need good captains and leaders within your group. People like John Terry, who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that Chelsea squad follows Jose Mourinho\u2019s guidance out on the pitch. It is One Direction, or no direction. Captain John Terry works hard to ensure everybody at Chelsea is heading in the same direction . ON THE PERIPHERY . Having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important. But the players out of the team, on the periphery, can lose you matches. Negative body language, people unable to cope with not playing, disruptive comments, and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad. The man-management of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the UEFA Pro Licence or courses put on by the Football Association. I\u2019ve spent the last three-and-a-half years working with a guy called Rob Northfield, who runs Inspire based up in Harrogate, on man-management skills for my players, my staff and of course myself. He deals with chief executives of the infamous banks and building societies. Allen won a championship with Gillingham and is hoping to soon do the same with Barnet . Since then, I have one championship in the bag at Gillingham and hopefully by the end of this month would\u2019ve bagged a second. Without Rob Northfields this would not have happened. Mourinho is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side. He knows at some point in the season he will need them and they are always fighting for him. Players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing. Allen\u2019s Analysis\u2026 . One person I keep hearing about\u2026 Gary Rowett Gary Rowett is winning so many games and doing so well at Birmingham City. He has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the Championship. He did a tremendous job at Burton Albion and back then there was no doubt in my mind, having played against his teams over the last couple of years, he would go on to manage at a much higher level. He must've asked me at least one hundred questions when my Gillingham team visited Burton the week after winning the championship. He was like Bamber Gascoigne, the old University Challenge presenter - non-stop firing questions at me. He was listening to the answers and asking intelligent questions about how we managed to win the league with Gillingham from a team that had previously been mid-table. For me, he\u2019s heading for the top. Allen believes Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett is going to go all the way to the top . One thing I\u2019d change about\u2026 perceptions in football . At Barnet last summer, I found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people. I took on Jon Nurse, born in Barbados, as a player-coach. I was impressed when he told me how when he was a teenager he lost his mum and he had the responsibility to bring up his younger brother. On top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games, winning a promotion, the FA Trophy and been in numerous playoff finals. He also has a UEFA B coaching licence and a schoolboy skills training academy called Love The Ball. I took on another player-coach, goalkeeper Graham Stack, an Irishman, who has four impeccably behaved children, who runs the Graham Stack Soccer Academy for youngsters and a high-end executive travel company with his wife, who can build patios and brick walls alongside his UEFA B coaching licence. Former Arsenal goalkeeper Graham Stack has been working alongside Allen as a coach at Barnet . Then I was introduced to a young man called Omar Yabroudi who moved to London from Dubai and wanted to be my analyst. He works hard and has been a real help. He works for virtually nothing and has fitted in superbly. We have a 23-year-old female physiotherapist, Jade Cook, who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time. She is calm, quiet, well-organised, disciplined, structured and I am very happy all the players are being so well looked after. I did not take on a Barbadian, an Irishman, an Emirati or a female because of their nationality, or skin colour or gender. I took them on because they\u2019re good at their jobs, they are good people, with good personalities and they have excellent characters. I\u2019m very proud of all of them in their first year working for me and no doubt all four will go on to work at the top level in the Premier League. Without them we would not have been top of the Conference for so long. The big issue\u2026\u00a0England coming out of the dark ages. When I was a little boy watching England versus Poland in the front room with my dad, the amazing Jan Tomaszewski, who Brian Clough called a \u2018clown in gloves,\u2019 stopped England qualifying for the 1974 World Cup with his heroic performance in goal. The panel of pundits, all those years ago, said we\u2019ve got to change. We\u2019re not playing the type of football other countries play; our children don\u2019t get coached to be good technical players like other nations. Over the years I\u2019ve heard it time and time again. The same old stuff. Especially over the last few years with the Spanish dominance, people asking why we have not got the Iniestas and Xavis of this world on our shores. Allen believes Greg Dyke is the man to help find the Iniestas and Xavis of the English game . The Football Association\u2019s technical director now, Dan Ashworth, appointed by my old chairman Greg Dyke, is a forward-thinker who can finally make some changes. He may never have played a professional game in his life, but at West Bromwich Albion he implemented a modern football structure at the club, where the manager does not have to deal with everything, where other departments and professionals are involved. Greg Dyke speaks to Premier League chief Richard Scudamore ahead of his FA council meeting . Ashworth can handle himself well. At a League Managers Association training day a couple of years, at a hotel near Reading, one Sunday afternoon, speaking just before Fabio Capello, Ashworth faced a roomful of sceptical, old-fashioned managers that thought they knew best and thought they knew the way forward. The gave him a torrid time with their caveman-like mentality that the manager should run the whole club. He handled the room carefully and skilfully and I think Greg Dyke has put English football into the right hands. He is the right man to take England back for their second World Cup win.",

Ranked well below battle-hardened foreign jihadis from warzones such as Chechnya and East Africa, the Westerners believe ultra-violence is the only way to make their name in Syria and Iraq. This would partly explain why so many Western extremists are eager to take part in the terror group's sickening propaganda releases, such as the seven savage filmed beheading videos featuring depraved British terrorist Mohammed Emwazi, also known by the name Jihadi John. Militants: Ranked well below battle-hardened foreign jihadis from warzones such as Chechnya and East Africa, Westerners believe ultra-violence is the only way for them to rise up the ranks in Syria and Iraq . Western fighters waging jihad in Syria and Iraq often appear disillusioned by the mundane jobs they are given upon arrival. British militants have previously been known to complain on social media about being ordered to clean toilets or wash the plates of senior terrorists. By far the most common job for Western jihadis, however, is guarding prisoners. While some complain that this involves little more than standing bored in a doorway or handing over meals, others have used their unlimited access to these defenceless so-called 'enemies of the state' to build a reputation for the kind of shocking cruelty and sadism ISIS commanders appreciate. One former prisoner has now revealed that many of the thousands of Europeans who have flocked to join ISIS over the past year have been shocked to find themselves marginalised within an organisation where Iraqi and Saudi nationals rule. 'They come \u00adexpecting a heaven and when they see the reality they are shocked,' a Syrian former prisoner identified only by the name Omar told The Times. 'There is a hierarchy in ISIS and the foreign fighters and the Syrians are at the bottom of it,' he added, revealing that fighters from Tunisia consider themselves the group's military wing, while Saudis are largely dominate religious affairs. Doomed: The Syrian former prisoner, identified only by the name Omar,\u00a0revealed he had been held for a short time alongside  Kenji Goto before the\u00a0Japanese journalist (left) was savagely murder by Jihadi John (right) Flying the flag: It is widely-understood that Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State are so unfit and badly trained that they are used as little more than cannon fodder . Omar, who was sentenced to death and spent six months in an ISIS prison 18 miles north of Aleppo before taking part in a daring but successful jailbreak three-months ago, also revealed that he had been held for a short time alongside Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. Goto was later transferred to another prison by ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, before being savagely murdered by the aforementioned Emwazi on January 31. 'There are two ways to prove your allegiance to IS: either by getting married or by carrying out the punishments,' Omar said, using an alternative acronym for the terrorist organisation. They were merciless - the \u00adforeign fighters and the \u00adSyrians treated us the worst because they are the lowest in Isis,' he went on to say. It is widely-understood that Britons travelling to Iraq and Syria to join Islamist militant group ISIS are so unfit and badly trained that they are used as little more than cannon fodder. Many of them are unable to communicate in Arabic and when not cleaning and cleaning for senior commanders tend to while away their days on social media where they pretend to be vital cogs in the ISIS wheel for their gullible sympathisers in the West. Outcast: Many of the thousands of Europeans who have flocked to join ISIS (pictured) over the past year have been shocked to find themselves marginalised within an organisation where Iraqi and Saudi nationals rule . Speaking last year,\u00a0Peter Neumann - director of the International Centre of Radicalisation at King's College London - said British fighters in particular are poorly rated. 'In a context like ISIS in Syria you have all these battle-hardy Chechens and then you have some fat guy from Luton turning up,' he told the Financial Times. While many of the European extremists joining ISIS tell their commanders they will be willing killers, very few of them have ever even held a gun by the time they arrive in Syria or Iraq. Useless in combat and a liability in situations when a simple mistakes can cost lives, the few Westernisers who do make it on to the battlefield are used as little more than cannon fodder. Leading the line when the odds are stacked against them, or acting as suicide bombers to clear the path for more experienced and important fighters,\u00a0ISIS commanders convince the young men that their lives on earth are worthless and that to die for the terror group is somehow praiseworthy. These arguments are lapped up by the idealistic young fighters who appear not to notice that it is never the commanders or other senior figures within ISIS who have the 'honour' of losing their lives.",

Last week the U.N.'s human rights chief said Boko Haram fighters have been murdering dozens of young women and girls they had taken as 'wives' and using children as 'expendable cannon fodder'. As the Islamist militant group has retreated from parts of northeastern Nigeria, 'gruesome scenes of mass graves and further evident signs of slaughter,' has been brought to light, Zeid Raad al-Hussein told a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. Boko Haram's reported use of children as shields and human bombs would, if confirmed, constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, he said. This comes in response to recent reports that hundreds of women and children had been seized from Nigerian primary schools by Boko Haram militants to be used as 'human shields'. The Islamists took as many as 500 adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak in late February, Mike Omeri, spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, said. Still there: A boy is photographed yesterday walking past a burnt house and car in N'Gouboua, near Lake Chad in Chad, which was attacked by Islamist group Boko Haram earlier in the year . Today it emerged that those caught up in deadly attacks by Boko Haram - who declared their allegiance to the Islamic State terror group earlier this year - have been asked to draw pictures of the massacres as part of their therapy. Young men and women at a UNICEF-run refugee camp near Baga Sola in Chad were photographed using pencils and crayons to draw bloody scenes of assault rifle-wielding gunmen carrying out slaughters from the back of pick-up trucks. The chilling creations illustrate the innocence of the young victim savagely murdered by the jihadis. Boko Haram has been waging a guerilla war in northern Nigeria and also attacked towns in neighboring countries, prompting nations in the region including Chad and Niger to put together a force to combat them. The newly elected president of Nigeria, General Muhammadu Buhari, who beat incumbent Goodluck Jonathan in a landslide win last night, has promised to 'stamp out' the insurgency . In Kano state, where Boko Haram's 'war' on the civilian population has been most prominent, Buhari delivered a crushing defeat to Jonathan, winning 1.9 million votes for Jonathan's 215,800.

Wheelchair-bound  Christopher Starrs, 50, was allowed to go free from court with just a suspended jail sentence in January after admitting his part in a two-and-a-half year con against his employer BT. Starrs, along with fellow BT Openreach manager Phillip Tamplin, invented clamped cars, overtime hours and damage to home owners\u2019 property during broadband installation, and paid off engineers to help them make the fake claims. Blasted: Judge Nicholas Cooke QC (left) blasted his junior colleague Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC (right) for 'taking his eye off the ball' when he sentenced Christopher Starrs in January this year . Both\u00a0Starrs and\u00a0Tamplin, 53, who made \u00a3124,000 from the con, admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses. Tamplin was jailed for two years at January's sentencing hearing, but Mr Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC spared Starrs jail as an \u2018act of mercy\u2019 - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a \u00a31,500 fine. However, senior Judge Nicholas Cooke QC has now said the sentence was \u2018unlawful\u2019 - and added Starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes. \u2018It was an unlawful sentence passed and now I need to do something to put it right, because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter,\u2019 he said. \u2018He was mercifully dealt with, sadly by a judge who didn\u2019t have his eye on the ball.\u2019 The judge told Mark Haslam, defending: \u2018The sentence was wrong but that\u2019s a matter of personal opinion. \u2018Your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison. \u2018What the Recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasn\u2019t available to him. \u2018No one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on Mr Starrs was unlawful. \u2018I am sorry to be the headmaster but we really don\u2019t want this sort of thing.\u2019 Fraud: Wheelchair-bound Starrs, 50, was a manager with BT who admitted defrauding the company of \u00a328,000 over two years . The Recorder, who is the head of 4 Bream Buildings chambers and took the Silk in 2006, gave Starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine, and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue. But Judge Cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order. Turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing, he added: \u2018This is supposed to be a centre of excellence, when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and can\u2019t do. \u2018The judge should have been told what his powers were.\u2019 Prosecutor John Ojakovoh said Starrs offered a \u2018blank cheque\u2019 at sentencing and has already paid back the \u00a328,000 he stole. After the judge heard the CPS will now drop the confiscation proceedings, he said the original sentence will stand, quipping: \u2018He no doubt thanks his lucky stars.\u2019 Both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time. The main fraudulent claim was for BT vehicles which had been \u2018clamped\u2019 by parking authorities. BT Openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work. The company pays out around \u00a31million in fines in London alone every year. Starrs and Tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates. Sentencing Recorder Trimmer, who has led a string of high-profile Serious Fraud Office prosecutions in the last two years, said: \u2018This was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time. \u2018It involved over 100 or so false claims, made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity. \u2018Both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity. \u2018You both knew how it could be conducted, concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally.\u2019 Starrs, of Northolt, Middlesex, who had worked at BT since 1988, was excused from sitting in the dock because he is in a wheelchair. He was not at court today due to a mix-up over whether he was required to attend.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8\u00bd minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace . Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home.",

The initial picture released on Tuesday shows a couple of orange-tinged blobs: Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. But the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about Pluto's remote, unexplored corner of the solar system. \"This is pure exploration; we're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes,\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator. Launched in 2006, New Horizons is nearing the crucial point in its epic voyage of more than 3 billion miles. The probe is due to make its closest approach to Pluto on July 14. \"In an unprecedented flyby this July, our knowledge of what the Pluto system is really like will expand exponentially, and I have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries,\" said John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of the NASA Science Mission Directorate. Discovered in 1930, Pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system. But scientists have since revised that view because of Pluto's size and location, demoting it to the status of \"dwarf planet\": a planet that's too small to clear other objects out of its way. Pluto is 1,400 miles wide, roughly half the width of the continental United States. At 3.6 billion miles out in the solar system, it's about 40 times as far from the sun as Earth is. By discovering more about Pluto and its moons, New Horizons will shed light on a little-known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants. The area, known as the Kuiper Belt, contains \"mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks,\" according to NASA. It's known for producing comets, such as Halley's Comet, which orbits the sun about every 75 years. New Horizons will use its array of cameras and other instruments to study Pluto's surface and atmosphere, as well as its moons, which number at least five. It will also be on the lookout for rings and other satellites. Stern said the spacecraft's encounter was set to be \"an exploration bonanza unparalleled in anticipation since the storied missions of Voyager in the 1980s.\"",

High-risk groups - such as the very young and very old, and most indigenous Australians - will be able to access free, government-funded flu shots from April 20. Experts say the modified version of the vaccination is worth waiting for. But Dr Alan Hampson, who chairs the Influenza Specialist Group, said everyone should be getting the vaccine, which also provided protection against Influenza A strain H1N1. He said H3N2 and B/Phuket caused a spike in deaths in Europe and the US during the northern winter because the vaccine available did not provide the right buffer against the diseases. There was a spike in deaths related to H3N2 and B/Phuket in Europe and the US during the northern winter as the vaccine did not cover the strains . World health authorities realised that and modified the vaccine to be used in Australia this winter. 'Our vaccine now should be a really good match for the strains that are circulating globally and we certainly hope we can prevent more deaths per capita than they did,' Dr Hampson told AAP. 'In fact the vaccine that will be used in the next northern winter will be exactly the same as the one we'll be using over the next few weeks.' Dr Hampson said people should be booking their flu shots now, given the delay in stocks arriving.

Based on the court's actions during the past two years, a . sense of inevitability is in the air: That a majority is on the . verge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's pivotal member on gay . rights, has been marching in this direction with opinions dating . to 1996. In his most recent gay rights decision for the court in . 2013, rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man . and woman for purposes of federal benefits, Kennedy deplored . that U.S. law for making gay marriages 'unequal.' Scroll down for video . A moment in history: People line up outside the Supreme Court in Washington April 26 ahead of Tuesday's arguments focusing on gay marriage . That 5-4 decision did not address a constitutional right to . same-sex marriage, but lower court judges interpreted the ruling . as an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans. When states appealed rulings striking down their same-sex . marriage prohibitions, the Supreme Court declined to intervene, . most notably in October 2014 when it denied appeals in seven . cases on a single day. Instead, the nine justices are hearing in Tuesday's oral . arguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional U.S. appeals court that went the opposite way. Last November, the . Cincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit . upheld gay marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and . Tennessee. With 37 of the 50 states now permitting gay marriage, many . because of judicial orders, it seems unlikely the country's . highest court would reverse course. Public opinion polls over . the last decade have shown large increases in support for gay . marriage. A ruling is due by the end of June. Yet some questions remain. How much will Kennedy, a member of the court's five-man . conservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases, . show his hand in the 2-1/2 hours of oral arguments? Will he . reveal a clear view that the Constitution gives gay people a . right to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests in . controlling marriage laws? An element of uncertainty hovers over Chief Justice John . Roberts, who broke with the other court conservatives and cast . the deciding vote upholding President Barack Obama's healthcare . law in 2012. Roberts voted against gay rights in the 2013 . ruling. But he separated himself from the most conservative . dissenters and declined to declare outright that states may ban . gay marriage. He has demonstrated apprehension about the reputation of the . court that, by virtue of his service as chief justice, . informally bears his name. In his opinions, he has sometimes . tried to lower tensions in controversial cases and reassure . people that the court is aligning with precedent and public . expectations. The question is not only how Roberts might vote but what he . might write. In the 2013 ruling, he denounced the court majority's . sentiment that federal lawmakers were deliberately harming gay . people with the limited definition of marriage. 'I would not tar . the political branches with the brush of bigotry,' he wrote. For the other seven justices, expectations are clearer. The four liberals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, . Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, have signaled their opposition . to state same-sex marriage bans. On the other side have been the . three most conservative justices, Antonin Scalia, Clarence . Thomas and Samuel Alito, asserting that nothing in the . Constitution guarantees same-sex marriage. Two legal questions are before the justices: whether the . Constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection . cover a right to same-sex marriage; and, if they do not, whether . states that ban same-sex marriages must recognize such unions . performed in other states. Gay couples and their families, about 30 adults and 20 . children, have appealed the 6th Circuit's decision. The name . petitioner is James Obergefell, who wanted his home state of . Ohio, which prohibits gay marriage, to recognize his Maryland . marriage to John Arthur as Arthur was dying from amyotrophic . lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Officials expect the courtroom to be packed to its 400-seat . capacity. Lines for general spectator seats began forming around . 6am on Friday, more than four days ahead of the scheduled . oral arguments at 10am on Tuesday.",

Patients at Wolfson Children's Hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them. Scroll down for video . The toys include a long 'tail' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. The Idaho firm behind the system\u00a0has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the US, letting anyone play with cats via the system - and plans to sell a version for pet owners via Kickstarter next month. 'Play through programs like the Play with Cats project has a powerful normalizing effect on a child's hospital stay,' said Wolfson Children's Hospital President Michael Aubin. Patients who are in isolation with a specific treatment or a chronic medical condition like cystic fibrosis or bone marrow transplant will be among the first to benefit. Made possible with a $15,000 grant from the Mattel Children's Foundation, the Play with Cats program connects to 151 hospital rooms throughout Wolfson Children's Hospital via GetWellNetwork. The Wolfson Children's Hospital Auxiliary first started a Pet Therapy Program in 1995. Two years ago, the hospital opened a pet visitation program, allowing children with long-term stays or in end-of-life situations to receive a visit from their own dog. 'This is the latest program to be implemented at Wolfson Children's Hospital to give more of our patients a chance to interact with a kitten or cat, which provides a welcome distraction.' said Pat Kirkland, Family Support Services Manager at Wolfson Children's Hospital. 'About 20 percent of our patients are on isolation at some time during their stay, so we are excited to bring the healing power of an animal friend to the bedside.' 'Our partnership with Wolfson Children's Hospital began with JHS veterinarians providing required vet checks and vaccines that allow patients in the hospital to visit with their own dogs. 'We are proud to expand the partnership using iPet so that all patients may benefit from the healing power of animals,' said Denise Deisler, executive director of the Jacksonville Humane Society. The system was developed by Idaho firm ReachIn. 'The idea came from the ability to move anything over the web,' Scott Harris of the firm told MailOnline. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. 'We started working on the technical side of remote control, and then an engineer went home to work on arm overnight. The next day he came in, took me to one side and said he'd been moving the arm, and his cat had started playing with it. He admitted he then hadn't got any work done and spent the evening watching the cat play - so I thought we might be on to something.' The firm contacted a local animals shelter and worked with them to build three toys. In May 2012, the first catcam went online, and was a huge success. Users join a virtual queue, and can then control three toys and a webcam in the enclosure. The iCompanion site that visitors play with cats in rescue homes around the US virtually . Now the firm plans to expand the idea after huge interest from shelters. Users from 90 countries played within 2 weeks playing, and adoption rates went up 57% at shelters, said Harris. The firm is now trying to work out how to fund the systems after over 300 charities got in touch wanting it. The firm is launching a kickstarter campaign to allow people to buy their own version of the system on May 1st. Users can control a variety of toys in the enclosures . 'it costs us to build these things and maintain them, and 317 shelters have requested it, so we are working with as many as we can.' The firm hopes to develop a low cost version costing around $200 for shelters, but admits the R&D costs are currently too high.

These outbursts can be triggered by anything from being refused an ice cream to frustration at an early bedtime. Now a new\u00a0video created by Oprah Winfrey's OWN TV, reveals just what's happening in a child's mind when they become angry and upset - and the best way to help them calm down. Scroll down for video . When I'm mad, my brain can get a headache and it can start hurting,' says one child, explaining what goes on in his head when he starts to feel angry . A group of children describe their feelings in the midst of a passionate outburst, in a video featured on Super Soul Sunday, Oprah's Emmy award-winning TV series. And while\u00a0mindfulness has become the latest buzzword when it comes to dealing with stress and bolstering your mental well-being for adults, it seems children are also benefiting from it. The video titled, What Children Can Teach Us About Anger, is described as showing that 'you're never too old, or too young, to discover mindfulness and let anger go. 'In this short, we hear from children who have already learned a life-changing lesson - taking a deep breath can change your whole world.' Talking about what happens in their minds when they get angry, the children in the video explain how it's easy to feel out of control. 'When I'm mad, my brain can get a headache and it can start hurting,' says one. Mindfulness has become the latest buzzword when it comes to dealing with stress and bolstering your mental well being.\u00a0And it seems that you're never too young to learn the art . Learning to simply take a deep breath can help children diffuse their own anger. 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains one child already using the technique . 'First, you find a place where you can be alone. Then you find some way to relax and calm down,' says another little girl, explaining how she uses mindfulness techniques to combat feelings of anger. While another goes into more detail about his temper: 'Your blood keeps pumping because you're really mad. You start to get sweaty because you're getting really, really mad. And then when you start getting really mad, you turn red.' One little girl offers up an analogy to explain her anger, using a jam jar and glitter. 'It's kind of like if you had a jar. The jar would be your brain, and then you put glitter in the jar. 'If you shook up the jar and the glitter went everywhere, that would be how your mind looks.' These children all seem to have the presence of mind to know what to do when they find themselves lost in a passion. 'First, you find a place where you can be alone. Then you find some way to relax and calm down,' explains one little girl. 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains another girl, who appears to have mastered the art of mindfulness at a remarkably  young age . Others expand on how to use deep breaths to refocus the mind. 'Your blood keeps pumping because you're really mad. You start to get sweaty because you're getting really, really mad. And then when you start getting really mad, you turn red,' says one child, struggling with anger . 'I breathe in through my nose,' explains one, while another adds that she likes to close her eyes while taking deep breaths. 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains the youngster who used the glitter analogy. 'It's like all the sparkles are at the bottom of your brain.' Defined by the NHS as paying more attention to the present moment, and to your own thoughts and feelings, mindfulness is fast becoming a tool for the masses . 'My brain slows down and then I feel more calm, and then I'm ready to speak,' explains a little girl who appears to have mastered the art of mindfulness at a very young age . Studies claim that adopting a more 'mindful' approach to life can not only reduce your daily stress, but prolong your mental health. It's also a key tool in helping people deal with their feelings of anger and frustration. Mark Williams, professor of clinical psychology at the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, explained that the technique can allows us to 'become more aware of the stream of thoughts and feelings that we experience'. Adding that by taking the time to consider what we're really feeling, and why, can help to quickly diffuse reactions and behaviour that are 'unhelpful' or unpleasant.",

How long could you keep going for, in the face of indifference and inaction? When more than 200 Nigerian girls were kidnapped from their school a year ago by Boko Haram militants, millions of people around the world joined a social media campaign to plead for their safe return. Charles Alasholuyi was one of those people -- from celebrities to world leaders -- voicing their anger via #BringBackOurGirls, one of the top Twitter hashtags of 2014, used in more than four million tweets. But as weeks turned into months, there was still no sign of the missing girls. The spotlight on the campaign faded. People stopped tweeting. They stopped marching. They stopped pleading with the Nigerian government to do more to rescue the young students. It seemed everyone had given up hope that the girls would come back. Many questioned whether they were even still alive. Everyone, that is, except Alasholuyi. The marketing professional and father-of-three has taken time nearly every single day since the girls went missing to hold up a sign featuring the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag, have his colleague take his photo with it, and post it on CNN iReport. Alasholuyi, a believer in the saying that \"an injury done to one, is an injury done to all,\" says he does this to help give the families of the girls a voice. He admits his daily routine can be stressful and frustrating and he hopes that one day soon, he will be able to stop doing it. But so far he hasn't dared give up his commitment, saying he feels a moral obligation to continue posting his daily photo until the girls are returned. He says he doesn't want anyone to forget about them and the struggles their families are facing every day the girls are missing. #BringBackOurGirls one year on: 'We should all feel shame' Alasholuyi adds messages on the signs like \"over 200 stolen dreams,\" \"save the girls now\" and \"our government has a responsibility to protect us all.\" Over the past year, he has also worked with organizations who are holding the Nigerian government accountable, demanding they do more to find the girls. Most recently, he participated in a 10-kilometer march through Lagos. He has also met local leaders to highlight the need for girls to be able to get an education without the fear of being abducted. Malala's letter to the abducted schoolgirls . Alasholuyi has also appealed to his government  -- and other nations -- to fight the violence imposed by Boko Haram which has carried out multiple attacks and abductions since the kidnapping of the Chibok girls. \"Yesterday was Chibok, the day before yesterday it was somewhere in the north, today it could be another town. Tomorrow it could be my village,\" he said. \"Why not cry out loud now for the whole world to come to our aid and make sure that the Boko Haram insurgency and their senseless abductions are nipped in the bud.\" He told CNN he believes the newly-elected government, which is due to take office on May 29, will step up efforts to locate the girls. He is confident president elect Muhammadu Buhari, the country's newly-elected president and a retired Major General in the Nigerian Army, will do more to combat the threat of Boko Haram. Alasholuyi says he believes in miracles and hopes his passion, commitment and determination to help the Chibok girls through his daily photos will one day bring them home safely.

It's quite a venture - and must have been a huge investment. There are 21 rooms, all with copper standalone baths placed near luxurious double beds. I keep thinking about Phil Neville, the former England footballer whose home once appeared in Hello! and which forever more is held as the gold standard for unadulterated bling. Which is to say that Poets House is glossy and lavish, but manages to stay on the right side of kitsch, not least because the finish is so good. There isn't a scuff in sight. State of the art: Poets House is as much a Sex And The City retreat as a hideaway in genteel Ely . No, it might not be to all tastes (there are mirrors everywhere with poetry written on them, such as lines from Kipling: 'Since my house to thy house no greater can send than thy house but my house, friend comforting friend') and the floors are given over to black-and-white squares with embedded stars. But you would be hard pressed not to have a good time here. We arrive on a wet blustery evening. I pop into reception and ask where we can park and am told to leave the car exactly where it is. Valet parking will sort it at no extra charge. Then a man who says he has a Hungarian father and German mother escorts us purposefully to our room, opens the door and says: 'You have every shade of grey in here.' He must have used the line dozens of times, but still gets a kick from it. We unpack our whips (sorry, wash bags) before hurrying down to the shiny, funky bar and order two glasses of bubbly. Black and white: Poets House incorporates smart, clean lines, elegant d\u00e9cor and crisp white tablecloths . We're in the zone, sitting on stools at the flashy bar as if auditioning as extras for a Sex And The City sequel, and have to pinch ourselves that this is Ely. The main dining room is a more formal, carpeted affair with crisp, white tablecloths and huge, bulbous wine glasses. There's an amuse bouche (naturally), followed by impressive, but over-elaborate, scallops and then perfectly cooked steaks. Back in our room, there are gadgets galore: a TV that connects to the internet, a Bose sound system accessible via Bluetooth, a tablet computer playing the role of the hotel directory. The carpet is thick, the shiny bedhead and curtains so over the top they make us chuckle. After breakfast, we tell a member of staff that we want to visit the cathedral. 'Just leave everything packed in your room and we will put it all your car, which will be waiting for you when you return.' It is, too. Poets House used to be an old people's home. For any lingering ghosts from those days, it must seem like a thousand years ago. Poets House . St Mary's Street Ely . Cambridgeshire . CB7 4EY . 01353 887777 . www.thehousecollection.com .

From getting stopped and searched for drugs in Mexico, to hijacking tuk tuks in India, the fun-loving broker has had many adventures beyond London's exclusive SW3 postcode. While you may expect him to enjoy the best luxury hotels around the world, the carefree traveller says he often packs the bare minimum and even enjoys staying in the odd Travelodge. Jetsetter: Andy Jordan from Made In Chelsea has enjoyed the best hotels around the world, but also enjoys a stay at Travelodge . Sat in Andy's London flat at the start of the bank holiday a travel edition of 'Would You Rather' kicks off proceedings. 'I don't think I've played this sober before,' he says, before revealing how he prefers action holidays to lying on a beach. 'I once took a girl on holiday to Morocco for her birthday,' he said when asked about the most romantic place he has taken a female companion. 'It was a bit awkward as we were together but broke up just before, but both still wanted to go. 'What she didn't realise is I had booked it based on the best surfing spots in the area and turned up at the airport with my surfboard. 'She was livid!' Action man! The singer loves to keep active on holiday and aims to surf in the Arctic one day . The singer released his album, Geography, last year and in the title song he sings about falling in love at first sight on London's Underground. The ladies of London will be delighted to know he is completely open to finding love on trains. 'I had my first 'train encounter' when I was 14 and I chatted to this girl for five hours, all the way from Oxford to Bodmin Parkway,' he explains. 'It was so incredible we even kissed when I got off and met up that evening on the beach. 'I am a big believer in that kind of thing.' Sun loving! The latest holiday the Chelsea boy went on involved the cast from the TV series. Their trip to Barbados was shown on the season opening episode this week . Most of the singer's future holiday plans involve ticking surfing spots off his bucket list. 'I want to surf in the Arctic, it's becoming a big thing and you can surf between glaciers with Patagonia wetsuits that let you go in four degree water.' Of course the Chelsea boy had a gap year, funded by doing a telesales job in his bedroom in pajamas, before surfing every day for six months around the world. When asked if he would rather join the Mile High Club and be caught or never join at all, his response is instant. 'Join it! Hands down! Just to clarify I am not currently a member of it.' Andy's favourite hotel is the Tryall Club in Jamaica. He stayed at the Round House and brought the whole of his family . His favourite place to stay is in the Tryall Club in Jamaica's Montego Bay. The country club retreat is where he has previously shared the sumptuous Round House property with his family. 'It's very cool as it has a huge turret and a dining room table that seats 18 people and the staff are amazing. 'I got blamed for drinking all the rum but it was actually the butler.' Andy also loves to check into London hotels such as the Corinthia, just for fun (as you do) and the Londoner believes the hotel service in the capital is among the best in the world. More rivalry! Andy Jordan and Jamie Laing set their sights on Made In Chelsea newcomer Jess Woodley . But it's not all sumptuous surroundings and butler service, Andy reveals he is also a fan of Travelodge. 'When I was on tour I took our whole team there and they do a great bed,' he said. 'Even Mark Francis would stay there, he is actually an extremely chilled traveller.' If the singer could pick anywhere in the world to busk for a day, it would be Union Square in New York in summer. 'I probably wouldn't get to play for very long as I would get chatting to someone, go for a coffee and end up exploring the city. 'Actually, an hour outside Wall Street and you would have about $400 and could leave it there anyway!' If Andy could take one of the Made In Chelsea stars on a desert island with him it would be Jamie. 'He would freak the most for sure, but he's such a positive person he would just think screw it and have a fun time. 'He's not a fan of organised fun so this would be the perfect place for him, but he would definitely start freaking out with then sun went down.' The TV series is on its ninth season, and can be seen on E4 on Mondays at 9pm . Hijacking tuk tuks! Just one of Andy's many holiday adventures when he has been outside of his London SW postcode . The Chelsea star enjoys going abroad as he is less recognised and does not have to act in such a refined way. 'In India I said to one of the tuk tuk drivers that I would pay extra if I could drive. 'It was a really great way of getting back from the temple to our hotel. 'But it was night and I nearly hit a cow, which are sacred there, and I had to swerve to miss it and a couple of people fell out!' His latest holiday was with the Made in Chelsea gang, and they flew with British Airways  from London Gatwick to Barbados. The gorgeous stars' holiday was shown on the season opening on Monday this week and Andy was clearly a fan of the company. 'The girls looked great in bikinis,' he grins, 'that's all I'll say.'",

The Gunners romped to a 4-1 win over Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, which was a seventh successive Barclays Premier League victory and moved them up into second place. While Manchester City could reclaim second by beating Crystal Palace on Monday and the title looks out of reach as Chelsea remain seven points ahead with a match in hand, there is no doubt when Wenger has all of his squad available Arsenal are capable of giving anyone a run for their money. Right back Hector Bellerin gave Arsenal the lead with a superb left-foot curling into the corner to get things going at the Emirates Stadium . Bellerin broke the Emirates deadlock for Arsenal, cutting in from his native right-hand side and curling a left-foot strike into the corner . Although there was disappointment at failure to progress in Europe following elimination by Monaco, the prospect of an improved league finish and successful FA Cup defence remains very much on the agenda. Wenger, who was often criticised over the direction of his team following almost a decade without a trophy, feels finally things are starting to come together. 'We have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team,' he said. 'There is something happening, that shows you that they are ready to fight for each other. Mesut Ozil is congratulated by his team-mates after his magnificent free-kick on the half hour mark put Arsenal fully in control of the game . 'You can see that, you can't cheat on that, people smell that. 'It of course is a good basis, and defensively we are getting better.' Following a poor start to the campaign, Arsenal were expected to struggle to sustain a place in the top four. Wenger, though, will not get complacent. 'I am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look, but what is true is that it's in our hands. How well we deal with the situation now will be important,' he said. Alexis Sanchez celebrates with Olivier Giroud after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area made it 3-0 to Arsenal in the first half . Wenger has his sights set on getting as close to Chelsea as possible, with the leaders set to come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26. 'I am a competitor and what that means is you have to go as high and as far as you can. When you go home if somebody was better than us, then 'well done', but we have to have given our best until the end and that is what I would like to do,' he said. 'Let's give everything to do it and see what happens. But Olivier Giroud ended any hopes of a Liverpool comeback by smashing in a fantastic fourth for Arsenal in stoppage time . 'We are in a good position, with four games at home and only three away. 'We are on a good run, so I would say that it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and level of urgency between now and the end of the season.' After failing to make the most of their positive start on Saturday, Arsenal had to soak up some pressure from Liverpool, with Raheem Sterling failing to capitalise when put in on goal. A huge flag is waved as Nacho Monreal and Giroud are among the first team-mates to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer . The Gunners finally broke the deadlock through the unlikely source of full-back Hector Bellerin, who slotted home a fine left-foot curling effort on 37 minutes. It proved the catalyst for an onslaught, with Mesut Ozil's free-kick and a rocket by Alexis Sanchez on the stroke of half-time effectively ending the contest. After Arsenal's tempo dropped, Liverpool reduced the arrears with a penalty from Jordan Henderson, but following the dismissal of Emre Can for a second yellow card, Olivier Giroud cracked home a late fourth to cap a memorable afternoon's work. Sanchez got in on the goalscoring act just before half-time, finding space outside the box to smash a drive over the head of keeper Mignolet . Wenger admits he has been impressed by the work-rate of both Bellerin and defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin, who were each drafted into the first-team as cover for injury, but are now an integral part of the side. Asked if either man was in his thoughts at the start of the season, Wenger said: 'Honestly, no. But my job is to remain open-minded and make decisions when you have to. '(I picked Bellerin against Liverpool) because of his pace. 'I thought (Daniel) Sturridge would play and then Sterling would have gone on the flank. Francis Coquelin challenges Daniel Sturridge During the Barclays Premier League match  at Emirates Stadium . 'Because of his low centre of gravity, Sterling changes direction very quickly and Hector is short as well.' Wenger added: 'I think you also have to give credit to players who get less, such as Coquelin. 'In the first half he broke up many attacks in a convincing way. 'But honestly I couldn't say that in my head (at the start of the season) Coquelin was one of the first-choice players.'",

Now the Green party has set it to music, with a new election advert featuring David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage forming a bizarre pro-austerity boyband. The video, complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change, is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration. The video begins with 'David Cameron' playing a white grand piano, with 'Ed Miliband' looking on . It sees Mr Cameron entering a polling booth and telling voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys' The advert is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration . The song, Change The Tune, features comedians playing the four party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition. According to the Green party, the quartet 'sing in harmony about their shared love of austerity and fondness for fracking'. It sees Mr Cameron tell voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys'. The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition.' It also takes a swipe at the background of leading politicians, with the verse: 'The choice between us couldn't be clearer, Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya, Whether it's Trident or High Speed Two, The lesser of four evils is up to you.' Notably the video, which last 3minutes, 40 seconds, does not feature Green leader Natalie Bennett at all.

Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition' She has suffered a series of difficult media appearances in recent weeks, including claiming people who join ISIS should not be criminalised, struggling to make her housing sums add up and admitting it could take decades to implement her 'citizen's income'. Despite the gaffes, the Green party has enjoyed a sharp rise in popularity in the last year and now boasts more members than both the Lib Dems and Ukip. Unveiling the new advert, Ms Bennett said: 'For many years the Establishment parties have been singing from the same hymn sheet. 'The Westminster consensus \u2013 which sees all other parties sign up to austerity economics, privatisation of our public services and inaction on climate change \u2013 is coming to an end. The Green Party is offering a real alternative to business-as-usual politics. 'We want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means bringing in a Living Wage of \u00a310 an hour by 2020 and fair taxes on rich individuals and Britain's biggest corporations. 'Voting Green on May 7th is a chance for people to play their part in breaking open the political harmony of the Establishment parties.'",

The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov.

Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table: . \u2022 Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88 . \u2022 Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. \u2022 Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06 . \u2022 Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. \u2022 Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. \u2022 Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation, U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases, Kuhns said. Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. \"The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter,\" Kuhns said. \"We are not sure what the exact impact will be.\" The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. \"There's other areas being affected,\" Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now \"can only serve water to customers on request,\" the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. \"If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are,\" State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was \"third in a string of great vintages this decade,\" the Wine Institute says. \"California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway,\" the institute said in a statement last year. \"A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years.\" Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. \"Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality,\" she added. \"With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine.\" That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.",

Clinical trials show that olaparib can delay the moment when the disease gets dangerously out of control. The drug already works for women with cancer fuelled by BRCA gene mutations, the defect that led to actress Angelina Jolie having her ovaries removed. New \u2018exciting\u2019 new research suggests the drug, already used to treat women with breast cancer, could also help men with genetic faults within their prostate cancer (pictured) tumours . Up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours that have DNA defects and these respond particularly well to olaparib. The London trial of olaparib, which is owned by AstraZeneca, was led by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden hospital. They found 16 out of 49 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug, also known as Lynparza. It stopped prostate cancer growth, generating lower tumour cell counts in the blood and improved responses in medical scans. The drug - called olaparib - can extend the length of time that a prostate cancer patient lives with the disease without it getting worse, according to new clinical trials. Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It is one of the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell\u2019s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. PARP inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop BRCA mutated cells from growing so they eventually die. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only cancer cells with genetic defects are targeted. Most of the men who had detectable DNA repair mutations had disease control lasting much longer than expected. This suggests the men most likely to benefit from the drug could be identified by testing to look for mutations. Olaparib became the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors to be granted approval last month for use in ovarian cancer by the European Commission and the US Food and Drug Administration. The inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell\u2019s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. The inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop mutated cells from growing. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only tumour cells with genetic defects are targeted. Professor Johann de Bono, who was the trial chief investigator, said: \u2018This opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer, guided by genomic testing and based on the molecular characteristics of patients\u2019 tumours. 'It shows that PARP inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought \u2013 in men as well as women, patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations, and in those with a wider range of gene defects.\u2019 The drug, olaparib, is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It works by blocking the cancer cell\u2019s ability to repair damage . Dr Emma Hall of the Institute of Cancer Research said: \u2018We\u2019ve seen a significant improvement in the length of good quality life men can hope to live even with the most advanced prostate cancers. 'These encouraging results show that olaparib could be the next drug to add to those already available.\u2019 The results of the trial were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research conference in Philadelphia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will now decide whether olaparib should become widely available on the NHS. A decision is expected in September. Dr Iain Frame of Prostate Cancer UK said: \u2018We want to get to a stage where every man gets the treatment he needs for his specific cancer.\u2019 Researchers did not specify the length of time for which olaparib was able to stop advanced prostate cancer worsening.",

Dr Giorgi-Guarnieri testified on Friday during court hearings in Washington, D.C., that will ultimately determine whether and under which conditions John Hinckley Jr. will be allowed to live full time outside a mental hospital. Giorgi-Guarnieri said Hinckley should be allowed to start the band but not perform publicly. One of Hinckley's interests is music, and he sings and plays the guitar. He also participates in music therapy. John Hinckley Jr, in 2014, the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, pictured for the first time since a court ruled he can spend 17 days a month away from a mental home where he has been for the last three decades at his mother's Virginia home . Secret Service agents and bystanders attend to those injured in the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr on March 30, 1981. \u00a0Hinckley's lawyers said mental illness drove the then 25-year-old Hinckley to shoot the President in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster . Hinckley's lawyer and treatment team say he's ready to live full time at his 89-year-old mother's home in Virginia under certain conditions. Hinckley has been allowed freedom in stages. He spends 17 days a month at his mother's Williamsburg home. If the man who shot President Reagan is allowed to leave a mental hospital for good, he should have to live under strict conditions, wearing an ankle monitoring device and driving a car with a GPS tracking device, government lawyers said on Thursday. Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said on Wednesday on the first day of hearings that Hinckley is 'clinically ready' to live permanently outside the hospital, a position supported by his treatment team. Levine said that the mental illness that drove the then 25-year-old Hinckley to shoot the president in 1981 in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster has been in 'full and stable remission' for more than two decades. But Levine and government lawyers disagree about the conditions Hinckley should have to comply with if he is allowed to live full-time outside of St. Elizabeth's mental hospital in Washington, his home since a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting. Prosecutors have proposed about three dozen conditions if Hinckley lives permanently at his mother's home in Williamsburg. Hinckley in his police mugshot in 1981 after he shot President Reagan. He has been allowed his freedom in stages following the assassination attempt . President Reagan with wife Nancy at George Washington University Hospital four days after the assassination attempt on him in 1981 . Those restrictions include monitoring software on the home's computer and a ban on searching for information about: himself, Reagan, Foster, and Reagan press secretary James Brady, who also was injured in the shooting. Prosecutors also want him prohibited from setting up social media accounts on sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, at least partly because he has been diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder, though his doctors say its effects have diminished. Hinckley's lawyers and the hospital oppose many of the restrictions. VJ Hyde, one of the people involved with Hinckley's case at St. Elizabeths, testified on Thursday that it could be helpful for Hinckley to explore information about himself, including news stories and information about the shooting and the people he hurt. Hyde also said the hospital 'adamantly opposes' requiring Hinckley to wear an ankle monitor. Hyde said 'many people don't recognize' Hinckley anymore, and he said the monitor would further stigmatize him. The judge overseeing Hinckley's case, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman, previously rejected prosecutors' request to have Hinckley wear an ankle monitor during the 17-day visits to his mother's home. Freedom for Hinckley, who turns 60 next month, has come gradually. For a dozen years, Friedman has allowed him increasing freedom, with the purpose of reintegrating him into society. Friedman first agreed in 2003 that he could have day visits with his family in the Washington area, then local overnight visits. Visits with his parents in Williamsburg followed. Those were expanded to 17 days by the judge in late 2013. It will ultimately be up to Friedman whether to let Hinckley live full time in Williamsburg and, if so, under what conditions. Some of the conditions attorneys are discussing are ones Hinckley already complies with while in Williamsburg and which both sides agree on: carrying a GPS-enabled cellphone, not talking to the media, and attending individual and group therapies. The U.S. Secret Service also keeps watch on Hinckley now and then, but it's not a condition of his release. Scott Hinckley, brother of John Hinckley, arrives at the federal courthouse in DC on Wednesday for the hearing on whether his sibling should spend more time outside the mental institution that he was sentenced to after shooting President Reagan .",

Enter Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye. Tonight, against Blackburn at Ewood Park, Rodgers faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them. His only hope must be that this time it doesn't go so horribly wrong. So far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest, so too have been the disappointments. He loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the Champions League against Real Madrid and lost. He wanted to save his best resources for Chelsea and lost that game, too. Kolo Toure found the net in Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Blackburn but his effort was ruled out . Blackburn salute their fans at Anfield after earning a Sixth Round replay at home to the Premier League side . When the European portion of their season fizzled out, first in the big show and then in the Europa League, the Premier League offered an opportunity. Getting into the top-four without Luis Suarez and often in the absence of Daniel Sturridge would be an immense achievement. Having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively, it became a real possibility. Then two huge games - Manchester United and Arsenal. A chance. Steven Gerrard lost his mind, the defence lost the plot and Liverpool lost by a combined total of 6-2 across the two games. A top-four place is virtually gone, unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on Manchester City. Suddenly, the romance of the FA Cup is a little more two-sided. They need it badly. Steven Gerrard's birthday falls on May 30, the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley . The FA Cup represents Liverpool's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season . 'I don't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,' said Rodgers before the replay of their quarter-final against Blackburn. 'Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. 'So I think if we didn't get in the top four and we didn't have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. 'That's the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. 'That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.' The need for trophies has been a dominant theme since Rodgers took over at Liverpool and made them contenders again. There is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country. Daniel Sturridge will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of reaching the FA Cup semi-final . Glen Johnson is in good spirits in training ahead of Liverpool's trip to Ewood Park on Wednesday . But how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top-four place or a trophy. Raheem Sterling rather helpfully alluded to the need for the latter recently. That tricky contract situation has not gone away and it is less likely to have a happy ending for Liverpool if they can't present a silver argument to Sterling in the summer. The same goes for potential new arrivals. Rodgers can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements. Something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help. It's a tough ask. They face Blackburn with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season. Without Martin Skrtel and Emre Can tonight that defence could be vulnerable again. Steven Gerrard is also missing. Not ideal, though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a Championship side. In any case, Liverpool and Rodgers need to find a way through. It has been three years since they last won a trophy \u2013 under Kenny Dalglish - and the FA Cup is a chance to stop the clock. It's a defining moment that must not end in another failure. Liverpool have not won a trophy since they beat Cardiff to win the Carling Cup three years ago . Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool, November 4 . Finally back on the grandest stage, but Rodgers opted for a watered down XI. Dejan Lovren, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Stirling, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Mario Balotelli played all previous Champions League matches but none of them started. The aim, it appeared, was to prioritise the following league game. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu . Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea, November 8 . It was time to vindicate the gamble in Madrid, which was widely criticised. Rodgers made seven changes to the side that lost in the Champions League and Emre Can put them ahead. But Chelsea won 2-1, leaving Liverpool eighth in the Premier League. Having rested a host of players in Madrid, Brendan Rodgers' side then lost a crunch league game to Chelsea . Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, January 27 . After drawing the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Liverpool blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage-time winner. A big opportunity missed. The Stamford Bridge also knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup following a 1-0 win at home . Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool, February 26 . Ten years after their Champions League miracle in Istanbul, Liverpool returned to face Besiktas in the Europa League last 32. They held a 1-0 first-leg lead. It went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,' said Rodgers . Demba Ba celebrates after Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty in the shoot-out against Besiktas . Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool, April 4 . Liverpool's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly. Raheem Sterling's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build-up and the game was a disaster. They were 3-0 down at half-time and ultimately repeated the kind of defensive inadequacies that hurt them earlier in the campaign. A huge anti-climax. Mesut Ozil curls home Arsenal's second in their 4-1 win over Liverpool in the Premier League last weekend .",

For those who did not manage to work out the cryptic clues that were designed to lead them towards the fictional Cheryl's birthday, then the answer was July 16. Those who were able to reason their way to this answer followed a series of logical steps that allowed them to rule out the other dates given as part of the question. The question, 'So when is Cheryl\u2019s birthday?' was one of 25 questions set in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. At first, it appears impossible to answer without more information but pictured is the method used to work it out . The question, 'So when is Cheryl\u2019s birthday?' was one of 25 questions set in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. It asked: Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates:\u00a0May 15, May 16, May 19,\u00a0June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16,\u00a0August 14, August 15 and August 17. Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. The puzzle asked:\u00a0Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates. May 15, May 16, \u00a0May 19 . June 17, June 18 . July 14, July 16 . August 14, August 15, August 17 . Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. Albert: I don\u2019t know when Cheryl\u2019s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard: At first I don\u2019t know when Cheryl\u2019s birthday is, but I know now. Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl\u2019s birthday is. So when is Cheryl\u2019s birthday? Albert said: 'I don\u2019t know when Cheryl\u2019s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard said: 'At first I don\u2019t know when Cheryl\u2019s birthday is, but I know now.' Albert said: 'Then I also know when Cheryl\u2019s birthday is.' To reach the answer, it is possible to work through the information both men known to rule out nine of the dates in a number of steps. First, we know Cheryl has already told Albert the month of her birthday, and Bernard the day. Each of the men does not know what the other has been told. So, for Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard cannot know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday cannot possibly be in May or June. This is because in the months of May and June there are numbers (dates) that only occur once across the four months - namely May 19 and June 18. If Albert had been given May or June as the month, there is no way he could be sure Bernard did not already know the birthday as  Bernard might have been the number 18 or 19. For Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard doesn't know, Albert must have been given a month that does not contain one of these 'unique' dates - i.e. July or August. The problem was posted on Facebook by \u2018Hello Singapore\u2019 television presenter Kenneth Kong, and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem. It was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (SASMO), which were held on April 8 (stock image of exam room shown) Albert's disclosure now gives Bernard the clue he needs to work out the birthday for himself. Bernard only knows the number of Cheryl\u2019s birthday, but from Albert\u2019s statement he has now also ruled out both May and June. This is because he realises Albert has ruled out May and June because of the 'single number' aspect above. As Bernard says he knows the date, we can whittle it down further to three dates by ruling out the numbers that appear in duplicate. If Cheryl had told Bernard that her birthday fell on the 14th of the month, then he could not have worked out the date at this stage. However, as he states that he now knows the date, we can rule out July 14 or August 14. This leaves just three dates to chose from - July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. Following Bernard's statement, Albert is then apparently also able to deduce the date of Cheryl's birthday. This means her birthday must be the only remaining date in the month he was originally told. Given that there are two dates left in August and one in July, it has to be the July date. So the answer is\u00a0July 16. Organisers of SASMO said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants.\u00a0This year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including Singapore, China and the UK took the test . The problem was posted on Facebook by \u2018Hello Singapore\u2019 television presenter Kenneth Kong, and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem. It was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (SASMO), which were held on April 8. This year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China and the UK took the test. Henry Ong, executive director of SASMO, told Mothership.sg: 'Being Q24 out of 25 questions, this is a difficult question meant to sift out the better students. SASMO contests target the top 40% of the student population and the standards of most questions are just high enough to stretch the students.' Of course, perhaps the more important question is whether Cheryl deserves a birthday gift at all after putting us through all of this.",

'We chose Shoreditch and Tech City quite deliberately as our new home, as we are a fan of London's growing stature as an international technology hub, but frankly our expectations have been exceeded by the level of engagement we've experienced from the startup community in this beautiful city,' said TransIP CEO Jeroen H\u00fcpscher. 'We've been blown away by the reaction to our event, the level of attendance and the infectious enthusiasm for building a vibrant and successful startup ecosystem.

John Pat Cunningham, 27, was shot by the Army in a field in Benburb, County Armagh. A 73-year-old suspect has now been detained in England. He is being taken to Northern Ireland for questioning at the police's Serious Crime Suite in Antrim. John Pat Cunningham (pictured, left, in photo held by his nephew\u00a0Charlie Agnew, right) was shot by the British Army in a field in 1974. A man has now been arrested over his death . The case was recently re-opened by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and a murder investigation started following a re-examination of the available evidence. Mr Cunningham had a fear of men in uniform and was running away from an Army patrol when he was shot. The Government apologised for his death in 2013. The inquiry is being carried out by the PSNI's Legacy Investigations Branch - a unit which examines historic cases from the Troubles. Relatives of Mr Cunningham, who had a mental age of between six and 10, said the investigation did not have their support. Mr Cunningham was running away from an Army patrol when he was shot. He had a fear of men in uniform . Victims campaign organisation the Pat Finucane Centre (PFC) issued a statement on the family's behalf. 'Whilst family members have cautiously welcomed the arrest, they have asked the PFC to state categorically that they will only have confidence in an investigative process that is completely independent of the PSNI,' said a PFC spokesman. 'Cunningham family members said in October 2013 that they wish to see all investigations into British Army killings, including that of John Pat, being investigated by an independent body.' The investigation into the shooting was re-opened in March this year. Speaking in March, DI Neil McGuinness of the PSNI said: 'I appreciate this happened more than 40 years ago but I believe there are people in the community today who remember this tragic incident, who knew John Pat and who may have information which would be of assistance to the investigation. 'Our objective is to get to the truth of what happened that Saturday morning so that justice can be served.' The Government apologised for his death in 2013. A police investigation was re-opened earlier this year . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

But they do leave their trash. Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. \"Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,\" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. \"We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,\" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. \"There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip.\" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing \"in an eco-sensitive manner,\" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.",

And English voters are so alarmed by the prospect of being ruled by Nicola Sturgeon with Miliband in her pocket that they would prefer to get rid of her \u2013 and Scotland \u2013 by giving the country independence after all. These are among the remarkable findings of a Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday which illustrates growing fears about the result of the most closely fought Election for decades. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday has shown a swing towards the Tories against Miliband's Labour party . Fear of Nicola Sturgeon, pictured, among Labour voters in England is pushing them towards Nigel Farage . David Cameron, pictured, has surged ahead by three points in the polls going into the final stage of the election . The poll suggests David Cameron is pulling ahead of Labour. The Conservatives are on 33 points, followed by Labour on 30, Ukip 18 and the Lib Dems 9 \u2013 the third Survation poll in a row to show a lead for the Tories. Intriguingly, there are signs that Labour, and not the Tories, is at risk from Farage\u2019s Ukip. In the past three weeks, Ukip support has risen by five points, with a corresponding four-point fall in backing for Labour. Furthermore, the Tories could benefit from Ukip voters returning to them as a result of the \u2018Red Ed and Nicola the Nat\u2019 factor. Asked if they would consider voting Conservative to stop a Miliband-Sturgeon alliance running the country, nearly two in five Ukip supporters said yes, against one in two who said no. The new trends coincide with the huge impact of Scottish Nationalist leader Sturgeon on the campaign since the TV debates, in which she repeatedly squared up to Miliband. The poll offers Cameron hope that more Ukip supporters may be provoked into returning to the Tories as a result of the Sturgeon threat. The dip in Miliband\u2019s popularity appears to reflect the belief that if he relied on Sturgeon to get his legislation approved by Parliament, she would hold the whip hand \u2013 even though her party would have only a fraction of the number of Labour MPs. More than half of those polled think Sturgeon would have the upper hand over Miliband, with fewer than three in ten saying the Labour leader would call the shots. The latest poll expressed concern over the possible influence Nicola Sturgeon would have over Ed Miliband . The poll also highlights the growing resentment among English voters at the thought of Scottish Nationalist MPs shaping laws in England on issues such as schools and hospitals, even though English MPs have no such power over these matters in Scotland. A third said that if the Election produced a Miliband-Sturgeon pact to run Britain, they would regard the result as \u2018illegitimate\u2019. That bears out the stark warning made by Home Secretary Theresa May today of the danger of a backlash by English voters if the SNP is involved in the Government of the UK. A total of 37 per cent of those polled said they would regard such a result as legitimate. According to the poll, English people may decide they would rather Scotland was given independence than be ruled by Left-wing Scottish Nationalists in harness with Labour. In the event of Miliband and Sturgeon forming some kind of ruling pact, more than 40 per cent said they would prefer Scotland to be independent. A third disagreed. In effect, it could lead to England and Wales declaring independence from Scotland in a reversal of last year\u2019s referendum, when the Scots voted to stay in the UK. The poll leaves no room for doubt where voters think Sturgeon\u2019s heart lies. Nearly three in four say she cares more about Scottish independence than whether the UK economy is doing will. Fewer than one in eight disagree. The survey also contains more evidence of Cameron\u2019s personal ratings lead over Miliband. By a margin of nearly two to one, the public believes Miliband\u2019s claim that the Prime Minister was to blame for the deaths of nearly 1,000 migrants from Libya in the Mediterranean showed that the Labour leader was \u2018unfit to be PM\u2019. The survey also indicates the Conservatives are winning the key economic arguments. Voters believe that if the Tories win the General Election on May 7, the economy is more likely to grow over the next five years; taxes and unemployment will be lower; the country will be safer; welfare abuse will be curbed and people will be generally better off. Labour won on two counts: better schools and hospitals and fewer food banks.",

Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan,\u00a0\u00a0but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona Costello, 51 (right) and her 14-year-old daughter Emily (left) have been missing for almost three weeks after last being seen on March 30 near their home in the wealthy seaside village of Greenport . The pair often go to shows and museums in New York City, but relatives have filed a missing person report after Emily did not return to her East Hampton school from Spring Break . Relatives of the family, who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork, reported them missing on Tuesday. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. Iona Costello also has family in England, though they have not heard from her, according to\u00a0Southold Local. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of\u00a0Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police said that they do not expect foul play and have no hard evidence suggesting that the Costellos may be in danger . The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm say it is strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online that his force do not expect any foul play. He said that he does not currently have any hard evidence to point to the mother and daughter being in danger. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones go straight to voicemail. Police still say they do not expect any foul play in the case, though workers at the Costello's North Fork farm say that she would normally be in contact about the business's affairs . Workers at the farm, which also includes cows, said that Mrs Costello told them she would be 'back on Tuesday' Mrs Costello was a well-known equestrian in eastern Long Island, according to the\u00a0East Hampton Star. Iona's husband George, co-owner of construction company Costello Marine in Greenport, died at the age of 63 a heart attack in 2012. The pair had married in 1999. It is not believed that the Costellos owned any property in New York, according to Chief Flatley, though authorities are now looking at a wider circle of relatives that may know about their movements in the city. A spokesperson for the NYPD said that city police are working in conjunction with Southold officers, but have not yet received any sightings of the mother and daughter. Southold Police have asked anyone who sees Mrs Costello or her daughter to contact them at 631-765-2600.",

There's nothing unusual about that, you might think, except there's not a child in sight...and the mum is simply colouring in because she wants to. Grown ups reaching for the crayons is a new global trend it seems, as adults say they're attracted to the creativity that colouring in affords. Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford has sold more than 1.4million copies of her colouring-in book for grown-ups, Secret Garden. The follow-up, Enchanted Forest, is expected to do just as well . Art and flowers: The book is the most popular in its genre and has now been translated into 22 languages . If you needed any proof, then browsing Amazon's bestseller list offers it. A book called Secret Garden by Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford, which includes 96 pages of black-and-white drawings has sold more than 1.4million copies and is riding high in the bestsellers chart. So far, it's been translated into 22 different languages. The New York Times has even reported on 'colouring-in groups', where grown-ups meet, as if they were in a knitting circle or book club, just to neatly daub colour on the right side of lines together. The arty fad is said to have started in France, where it was promoted as both a therapeutic hobby and a way of rediscovering lost creativity. Adult colouring-in titles are now said to be outselling cook books in the country, no mean feat for a destination that holds gastronomy so close to its heart. The allure is said to be the unadulterated pleasure of doing something for no purpose other than to enjoy the practice of colouring and staying within the lines. According to experts, it's a kickback against the stresses of modern life and technology, where everything, even leisure time has to be in some way useful or aspirational. The images in Basford's book are not particularly adult in theme, they depict scenes of both nature and fantasy. Basford, 31, told The Times: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it\u2019s a chance to do an analogue activity that\u2019s not on a screen. Everyone is creative deep down but as you get older you get less confident in your abilities.' The artist's second book, Enchanted Forest, is showing all signs of eclipsing the success of her first work. Basford says her success is down to people resisting modern technology in their leisure time. She says: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it\u2019s a chance to do an analogue activity that\u2019s not on a screen' In Australia, colouring-in circles have emerged, such is the pursuit's current popularity. One crayon fantatic Jenny Keane told the Sydney Morning Herald that she even enjoys colouring in with her husband: 'During the week some people like to go to the bar to decompress, whereas my husband and I like to sit down together and just colour.' She adds: 'I can't draw but I like to use my hands to get creative. Some people might use yoga or running but colouring for me is my sense of peace.' A study in the US in 2012 found that colouring in reduced anxiety among university students.",
