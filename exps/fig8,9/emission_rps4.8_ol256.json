Three-time winner Faldo has confirmed he will cross the famous Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory on the Old Course, having also lifted the Claret Jug at Muirfield in 1987 and 1992. Faldo, whose 58th birthday falls on the Saturday of the championship, said: 'The Open and St Andrews will forever hold a significant place in my heart. My fondest moments on my journey with this great sport are woven with pictures and emotions in this setting. It all means a huge amount to me. Sir Nick Faldo (left) and Tom Watson will compete at The Open for the last time at St Andrews in July . Watson will walk across the Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory there . 'I look forward to celebrating all that golf has given me as I cross that storied bridge and the wonderful memories I share with many people. I am grateful for it all and grateful to golf.' R&A chief executive Peter Dawson added: 'Sir Nick Faldo is an inspirational figure in British golf and has enjoyed a remarkable career in The Open. 'He has delighted the galleries over many years with his three victories and consistently outstanding performances. I'm sure there will be great anticipation among the galleries at St Andrews to see him play in The Open once again and he will receive a rousing ovation worthy of a great champion.' Five-time Open champion Watson, who lost a play-off at Turnberry in 2009 at the age of 59, received a special exemption from the R&A to play his final Open in 2015, the 40th anniversary of his first victory at Carnoustie. He and Faldo will be joined by the likes of Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson in the Champion Golfers' Challenge on Wednesday, July 15, a four-hole team event played on the first, second, 17th and 18th on the eve of the championship. Almost 10,000 spectators will be able to watch from seats on the first, 17th and 18th, with a two-tiered grandstand created behind the 18th green for the first time and an L-shaped arena behind the 17th green, as well as the traditional seats to the right of the first. The grandstand behind the famous Road Hole will have a capacity of more than 4,000, with a total of 21,000 seats around the entire course. Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, executive director of championships at the R&A, said: 'There is always an incredible atmosphere at The Open and particularly when it is held in St Andrews. We want to make sure as many spectators as possible can experience that unique atmosphere and enjoy wonderful views of the play on the opening and closing holes at St Andrews. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson paid tribute to the achievements of Faldo during his career . Tom Watson (right) poses with the Claret Jug alongside runner-up in 1975, Jack Newton (left) Rory McIlroy is the current holder of the Claret Jug and will defend the title at St Andrews this year . 'The new arena will provide a fantastic setting for the climax of the Championship at the 72nd hole and will be the ideal place for spectators to greet the new champion golfer of the year.' Several cameras have been implanted into bunkers on the course, with another 'turf camera' giving views of the R&A clubhouse from in front of the first tee. The R&A has also invested \u00a3150,000 in subsidising food and drink prices, meaning the price of fish and chips, for example, is down from \u00a310.50 to \u00a38.50.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man, told CNN on Thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident. \"One of the officers told me to stop, but it was because I (said) to them that what they did it was an abuse and I witnessed everything,\" he told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\u02da.\" Santana told Cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work. In other interviews, Santana has said he feared for his life, which almost kept him from revealing the recording. Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday. That evidence led to the officer's firing and arrest on a murder charge. Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He could hear the sound of a Taser in use. At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser. He believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana told CNN. Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser. After Slager shot Scott five times, the officer went back to pick up something. Santana thinks it was the Taser but said he wasn't 100% sure what it was. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording. What we know about Officer Slager . The cell phone video, which Santana revealed this week, reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of African-Americans and led to a murder charge against Slager, who is white. Scott was black. Police said Slager pulled the 50-year-old Scott over for a nonworking brake light on Saturday morning. Scott, according to a dash cam video, fled from Slager for unexplained reasons, and the officer chased him on foot. When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager. The video shows Slager shooting at Scott eight times before Scott falls down. Who was Walter Scott? Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward. \"He was there. God planned that. He's the ram in the bush -- I truly believe that,\" Judy Scott said. Santana agreed. \"I think she was right,\" he said. \"God put me there for a reason.\" Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording. \"When I saw my son running and I saw the policeman behind him, I couldn't take it,\" she said. \"I had to turn away. I couldn't handle it. In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution. \"At some point I thought about staying anonymous, and don't show my face, don't talk about it. But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am,\" Santana said. Santana did not say whether he had received threats. His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention. In the last half of the video, a second officer appears to examine Scott with gloved hands. Witness video, official accounts raise questions . Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR. A police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid, and that the third officer approached and helped that person \"with first aid and CPR.\" On Wednesday, asked whether CPR was performed on Scott, North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" A timeline of events .

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Last year: Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt last November \u00a0after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game against Hiram University . Never give up: Lauren, picture on March 22, is vowing to never give up her battle with rare brain cancer . A team player: Lauren is working with her doctors and family to fight the disease that will likely kill her . Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center at hospital) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain .",

Jessa, 22, and her 19-year-old husband Ben   announced the\u00a0the news of their pregnancy ina video for\u00a0TLC.com, which featured them both\u00a0making health smoothies, and Jessa has revealed that one of the first things the couple considered after hearing the news was how to adjust her workouts accordingly, to ensure that she can remain fit and active while expecting. Speaking to People magazine, the reality star explained that when it comes to exercising: 'I'm just trying not to overdo it right now. I am still working out, but not trying to break any records. Scroll down for video . Expecting: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald recently revealed that she is pregnant with their first child . Announcement: The baby is due on November 1, which is also the date of Ben and Jessa's first wedding anniversary . 'I want to gain a little less weight and not stress out about it. I do want to make sure that I'm eating healthy. You are eating for two but the other is, like, a speck. I am trying to make healthy choices now that I'm entering my second trimester.' The pair, who married after a chaste courtship, are well-known for their health-conscious lifestyle and are often seen on the Duggars\u2019 hit reality series enjoying healthy dinners or working out together, something which viewers saw frequently during the build-up to the couple\u2019s wedding, during which time Jessa was incredibly keen to trim down her already-toned physique. A recent episode of the show even saw Jessa pushing Ben's truck down the road while wearing workout pants covered with knee-length skirts to maintain their 'standard of modesty'. Jessa also frequently posts recipes and photos of healthy foods she's trying out on Instagram. Juiced up: Jessa and Ben are both champions of healthy eating, and even announced their pregnancy in an adorable video while making smoothies . Push it along: While getting ready for her wedding, Jessa stepped up her workout, part of which involved pushing her fiance's truck down a dirt road with her siblings inside . Interesting attire: The women in the religious Duggar family wear skirts over their workout pants to maintain their 'standard of modesty' As for her pregnancy diet, when Jessa discovered the news, she said that she thought she would take after other Duggar mothers when it came to her pregnancy cravings, but admitted that this hasn\u2019t been the case. 'I am feeling pretty good,' she added to People. 'I thought I'd crave pickles and lemons because my mother did, but I couldn't stand them. 'I'm hoping I'm having triplets because I've been eating so much!' However, Jessa does admit she will be looking to her older sister Jill for advice, as the 23-year-old just welcomed a son Israel with husband Derick Dillard on April 6, and is also a trained midwife. Jill kept up her exercise during the later months of pregnancy by\u00a0walking on the treadmill while listening to sermons. 70 hours later: Jessa's sister Jill Dillard (pictured) welcomed her son Israel on April 6 with her husband Derick after almost three full days of labor . Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c) Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.",

Isco returned to the starting XI for the second leg of the Madrid derby in the quarter-finals, as injuries to Gareth Bale and Luka Modric forced Ancelotti into a change of system.

Despite its secluded location it is home to the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy,\u00a0the world's largest Buddhist settlement. A vibrant splash of red, this colourful settlement has sprung up in the 1980s and is now a haven for over 40,000 monks and nuns. Larung Gar Buddhist Academy is home to 40,000 monks and nuns, who travel to the settlement of\u00a0Sertar to study Tibetan Buddhism . The red and brown houses are nearly identical, with one to three rooms per hut and no heating or toilets installed . The settlement is home to 40,000 nuns and monks, who flock to study, attend lectures and dwell in the mountains . Local children gather after class on one of the banks in the hilly religious institution. Monks and nuns are segregated by a winding road . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study at the remote dwelling. The wooden huts are built so closely together, they look like a red sea spreading up the hilly terrain. Nuns and monks are housed near to their colleges, and separated by age and sex. The segregation of male and female living quarters is marked by a winding road, which weaves through the dense mass of huts. All monks and nuns live close to the college but are housed in different district according the age and sex of students . Prayer forms an important part in the life of the monks who travel from multiple countries to attend lectures and classes in the area . Sky burials are common in the province of Tibet and involve corpses being cut and left for animals to devour. The human bodies are placed on mountaintops in order for the elements or predatory animals, typically vultures, to prey upon it. The majority of Tibetans and many Mongolians adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits. They believe after death the body is an empty vessel and there is no need to preserve it. By allowing nature or animals to take command of the body, they are disposing of the remains in the most generous way. In many areas of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and, due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical. Conditions are basic, with residents having to share communal toilets, and each unheated hut ranging from one to three rooms in size. An isolated religious haven, Sertar is located around 370 miles from Chengdu, and those wishing to visit have to travel by coach for a gruelling 20 hours. TVs are prohibited at the picturesque retreat, with monks and nuns flocking to benefit from the studies, prayers and lectures ran at the academy. The settlement has grown from a handful of disciples in the 1980s to become one of the largest centres for the study of Tibetan Buddhism . Prayer is undertaken by spinning the decorative prayer wheels which are located around the Buddhist settlement . Monks study after their lessons. Visitors are welcomed into the monastery to learn and witness the classes . Monks pray inside the biggest temple of the town. Inside, children and adults gather on the floor to sing songs . Photographer Wanson Luk journeyed to the secluded location from Chengdu on a 20-hour bumpy coach ride. The 34-year-old Buddhist said the Larung Area has two small guest houses, but as these were occupied, he had to stay near the entrance. He stayed two days at the Buddhist centre, taking part in ceremonies. Luk said that the settlement welcomes everyone, and they maintain their life in the hills from donations and by small businesses like the guest house or small grocery store. Sertar attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia . Tibetan monks, also known as lamas, are pictured at a grocery in the Serthar Buddhist Institute in China . 'I was most surprised about how people feel about death,' Luk said. 'I took part in the sky burial ceremony where there were hundreds or thousands of condors waiting quietly.\u00a0There were 7 corpses on that day...one of them was a child. 'During the ceremony a monk will pray then the \"sky burial master\" will start cutting the corpses.\u00a0When he is done, the condors will all fly to the corpses . 'They believe the more the condors eat, the better it is and they will not eat bad people's body.' Nuns travel to school by walking down the steep verges which can peak at nearly three miles high . Snow covers the surrounding hills of the\u00a0Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, where conditions can be bleak in the winter months . The resplendent Buddhist monastery is the focal feature of the academy, with a wall to prevent monks and nuns from mingling . At the peak close to the town, monks tie colourful prayer flags as a practical sign of their religious devotion . One encounter which struck a chord for Luk was the meeting of a nun who was on her 'no speech day'. When the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist. She ended up taking him around the whole monastery, showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray. Although TVs are prohibited in the monastery, iPhones strangely are permitted, with her typing words to instruct him as they went. At night the view of the Serthar Buddhist Institute is magical, with thousands of little lights illuminating the rolling hills . The settlement is also home to a number of Tibetan people who share the land with the monks and nuns . Prayer stones decorate the colourful Buddhist academy, which is only accessible by a long coach journey . Tibetan nuns, also known as lamas, are pictured on a street in the Serthar Buddhist Institute . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study here . Many of the Buddhists own second-hand  iPhone 4s. The incredible academy was established in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by Jigme Phuntsok, an influential lama of the Nyingma tradition. Despite its remote situation, Larung Gar evolved from a handful of disciples to be the largest Buddhist settlement in the world. It attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, who attend separate classes taught in Mandarin, while larger classes are taught in Tibetan.",

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

His views were echoed, more robustly, by commentators and fans alike. That might not be the end of the short-term Kiwi exodus, despite Jerome Kaino\u2019s decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the Lions in 2017. Charles Piutau rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast . Fly-half Colin Slade is thought to be deciding between a move to Toulon or Pau in France \u2013 while the latter club have already landed Conrad Smith. The prospect of piles of Euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the Top 14 league the destination du jour, for southern stars seeking a stint abroad. What makes the Piutau deal so eye-catching is that it is a bold endorsement of Ulster\u2019s ambition and also a boost to the wider Celtic game, below Test level. That boost is much-needed, because there are simmering problems \u2013 as exposed and bemoaned by Leinster\u2019s head coach Matt O\u2019Connor last weekend. The Australian was infuriated by the softly-softly stance of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose final say on release of Test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the Pro 12 clash with leaders Glasgow. Alun Wyn Jones can put his body on the line for\u00a0Ospreys and Wales . \u2018It hurts the league,\u2019 said the Australian, which is absolutely true. The Pro 12 has a credibility issue, due to the continuing absence of so many Irish stars from so many matches. While player welfare is quite rightly prioritised, there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions. No wonder the Welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the Aviva Premiership clubs during the European rebellion last year. A leading figure such as Alun Wyn Jones gives body and soul to the Ospreys week after week, but still found the energy to face down the more rested Irish in Cardiff during the Six Nations. He and so many others in Wales would enhance the Premiership. If the Irish cannot fully commit to a league \u2013 making it a fitting stage for Piutau\u2019s class \u2013 they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for European combat with their provinces. Scrap the LV Cup and bring the regions into an expanded Premiership. Job done. Wasps forward Hughes\u00a0was clumsy, not reckless . Wasps players were incensed by the three-game ban handed to their No 8, Nathan Hughes, for the collision which left George North unconscious last Friday night, and their angst is understandable. The big Fijian was clumsy, but no more, by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the Lions wing, as he scored a try. Nathan Hughes\u00a0was clumsy rather than\u00a0reckless and didn't deserve a three-game ban . The disciplinary panel called the offence \u2018reckless\u2019 and the reaction of Wasps captain James Haskell was priceless. \u2018Rugby is reckless,\u2019 he said. \u2018The whole game is reckless. If you\u2019re going to worry about that\u2026 maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch.\u2019 The England flanker had a point. The sport is founded on physicality and danger. A player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated, damaging contact, however accidental, but the suspicion lingers that Hughes is serving a ban because North was knocked out. If the scorer had jumped up and walked off, it\u2019s fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed. Fill World Cup seats or face fan fury . Is anyone really surprised that trying to buy World Cup tickets is such a drawn-out ordeal? For those without the benefit of a corporate invite (or a media pass, before anyone pipes up), securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of root-canal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket. The Webb Ellis Cup visits a school in Toronto as part of the Rugby World Cup Trophy Tour . We are in the cost-cutting age of do-it-all-online, so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on Monday. At least the old-fashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit, as so wonderfully evident at Wimbledon tennis down the years. Ultimately, the World Cup will be a sell-out, but organisers better be right when they say there won\u2019t be the empty seats which blighted the Olympics. As if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough, those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of well-heeled \u2018guests\u2019 can\u2019t be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena, or even turn up at all. Signing Sinfield is an inspired move . It\u2019s been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt, which is harsh on all concerned. Kevin Sinfield is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in Leeds later this year, from the Rhinos to Yorkshire Carnegie. Yorkshire Carnegie's signing of rugby league legend\u00a0Kevin Sinfield is a statement of intent . He wants to play fly-half and while the prospect of him igniting the Championship at the age of 34 is far-fetched, he is a proven leader and winner, and his mentality is what the union side at Headingley are keen to tap into. No doubt, he\u2019ll bring a few more through the turnstiles, too, but coach Bryan Redpath will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him. It is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation, Leeds are another second-tier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile. Last Word . Team GB, under the auspices of England, face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the Olympic Sevens tournament in Rio. In Hong Kong last weekend, Simon Amor\u2019s side \u2013 nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of Great Britain, ahead of Wales and Scotland \u2013 lost further ground to Australia and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings, one below the final qualification slot. This weekend in Tokyo, they must try to catch their rivals from Down Under, but they have been drawn in a pool with Fiji, who won in Hong Kong and are second in the rankings behind South Africa. Realistically, one Olympic place is up for grabs, behind those nations and New Zealand, and England\u2019s advantage is that the series culminates at Twickenham next month. Sadly, Team GB\u2019s preparations \u2013 complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby \u2013 have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight, and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting.",

Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of V\u00e1c in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Ter\u00e9zia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by \u2018new\u2019 diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of V\u00e1c's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria\u00a0Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second\u2013fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in\u00a0V\u00e1c in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'",

Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, was arrested after he burst into\u00a0Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham wielding an axe and demanding cash, as an accomplice stood at the door. But he was foiled after shopkeeper Sab Dhillon heard McKarry's demands and ran from the back of the shop and rugby tackled him to the floor. Mr Dhillon's wife then appeared clutching her son's baseball bat and managed to subdue him further. Scroll down for video . Prolific thief Shaun Andrew McKerry was once dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' because he always returned home after his many crimes, and he has been unmasked as the axe wielding thief in an attempted post office robbery - where he was subdued by the owner who rugby tackled him and his wife with a baseball bat (left) McKerry was dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' in the 1990s after he was arrested\u00a080 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998. He got his nickname because he always returned home after his crimes. He committed his first offence at the age of 11 and in the next five years went on to commit 1,000 crimes. His own mother even previously pleaded for her teenage son, known as a one man crime wave, to be locked up. McKerry pleaded guilty\u00a0at Durham Crown Court, via videolink from prison, to attempted robbery from the post office on March 15. CCTV footage of the incident shows the 31-year-old burst into the store and demand\u00a0terrified assistant Andrea Brighty fill his bag with money. But Mr Dhillon heard the incident and ran from the back of the store to pounce on McKerry. After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat. McKerry is pictured in handcuffs at the age of 15 when he was committing strings of offences in the area . As Mr Dhillon held him, the shop assistant removed McKerry's scarf so his face could be shown to the cameras. His accomplice, who had been standing guard at the door when they burst in, fled. Mrs Dhillon said: 'It was really scary. We didn't realise who he was at the time and how bad his previous convictions were.' Her husband told the Northern Echo: 'He did not hit me but there was a good chance that he could have as he was waving the axe about blindly while he was on the floor. Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor . 'I am OK and we're trying to get over it and we just want to put this behind us.' McKerry, who will be sentenced on April 24, is known by the nickname 'Boomerang Boy' or 'Homing Pigeon Boy' because he always returned home after his crimes. He once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His catalogue of offending included car chases with police, a string of burglary convictions, aggravated vehicle taking, sending indecent letters, witness intimidation, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and countless breaches of curfew, community sentences and offending while on bail. CCTV images show Mr Dhillon pouncing on 31-year-old McKerry, armed with an axe, from behind . Mr Dhillon and the terrified shop assistant (right) subdued McKerry and revealed his face for the cameras . Mr Dhillon tackled McKerry and both he and his wife said they did not realise his criminal history at the time . McKerry's case was even brought to the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair, who later announced a crackdown on so called 'bail-bandits'. He began offending from the age of 11, and has clocked up dozens of court appearances. On March 11, 1999, McKerry, of County Durham, had already been arrested five times between January 22 and February 10. Shaun Andrew McKerry started offending at the age of 11 when he committed his first theft in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000 he clocked up 1,000 offences. In the 12 months of 1995 he was arrested 80 times. McKerry managed to stay out of prison for 36 weeks in 1998, and was arrested 45 times. He was arrested five times between January 22 and February 10, 1999. McKerry became known as a one man crime wave and was dubbed Boomerang Boy because he always returned home, police knowing where to find him. His mother even called for her teenage son to be arrested. In 1999 she said: 'I love him as a son but I hate the person he has become.' In one of his earlier crimes McKerry  stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman. By the age of 15 McKerry had\u00a0convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. When he was 16 McKerry was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for\u00a0robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. At the age of 18 he was out of prison and had offended again, but was given a 'second chance' by magistrates. Just three days later he was back again. From then on he stuck to low level crimes to feed his drug habit. In 2011 he was jailed for four years after he admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. In March he was rugby tackled and restrained by Sab Dhillon when he went into the store, armed with an axe and demanded cash. He has 55 previous convictions. He boasted after one court appearance he would be back and returned just 48 hours later on suspicion of taking a car. The 15-year-old was then placed on a supervision order despite a report to magistrates that he was a danger to the public. Magistrates tried to provide him with a string of second chances and opportunities to rehabilitate himself - but each time he re-offended. In February 2000 the press won a landmark legal victory to name him when the Lord Chief Justice ruled Bishop Auckland Youth Court had done nothing legally wrong when it agreed to the paper's application to lift the juvenile's automatic right to anonymity. Lord Bingham said he had taken a great interest in the case which centred on the individual youth's right to freedom and anonymity against the public's right to be better protected by knowing his identity. As he continued to offend McKerry developed a drug problem and stole to feed his habit. Six months later McKerry, then 16, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. This was later cut on appeal but by March 2002, aged 18, he was back behind bars again after admitting two new offences - three days after being given yet another 'last chance' by magistrates. McKerry had been granted bail after admitting theft on a Monday but was picked up 48 hours later after helping raid a Bishop Auckland clothing shop. In 2002 his mother Paula Harp, 32, pleaded for him to be arrested after she said he had ruined her life. She claimed he started to offend because he was a bit of a loner, and began doing minor things like throwing stones before his behaviour escalated. In recent years, much of his offending has been for the theft of low value items, from shops in the south-west Durham area. But in May, 2011 he was jailed for four years at Durham Crown Court which heard he only had 18 months to live if his drug and alcohol abuse continued. McKerry admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. His lawyer said he had deep vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver, as a result of years of substance abuse. The court heard he had 55 previous convictions for 120 offences.",

Grace Rebecca Mann, 20, was found unconscious by two female roommates in the home they shared in\u00a0Fredericksburg, near the college campus, about 3pm. Local reports say Mann was asphyxiated and found with a plastic bag stuffed into her throat, however police have not commented on the cause of death. The fourth roommate of the house, Steven Vander Briel, 30, was home when the two women stumbled upon the body, but ran out of the house, according to\u00a0Fredericksburg.com. Scroll down for video .

Mann\u00a0- the daughter of a juvenile and domestic relations court judge in Fairfax County - was rushed to Mary Washington Hospital, but pronounced dead shortly after arriving. A major manhunt was subsequently launched for Briel. A nearby school, James Monroe High School, was placed on lock-down as officers scoured the streets with police dogs. Just over two hours later, about 5.30pm, some officers saw Briel emerge from the woods near Riverside First Church of God on Fall Hill Avenue. He was arrested and taken in for questioning. Police have since charged Briel with first-degree murder and abduction.

David Hibbitt, 33, was diagnosed with the disease in July 2012 and underwent\u00a0chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery to remove his large bowel. Doctors told him the cancer was terminal - so he decided to try cannabis oil as a last resort and bought it from a local dealer for \u00a350 a gram. Now the father-of-one says he has been cancer-free since his last scan in January \u00a0- and puts the class-B drug down to his miracle recovery. David Hibbitt, 33, claims doctors said he had between 18 months and five years to live after being diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. In desperation, he tried cannabis oil, which he now credits with his recovery . He is now looking forward to the future after tying the knot with his partner of six years Heather Martin, 26, at a registry office today. Mr Hibbitt, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Friends had told me about cannabis oil and I dismissed it at first. I've never been into drugs. 'But in February last year I was told I only had 18 months to five years to live, and I felt I had to try everything I could. 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die.' After going online to research his options, he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it. 'I pay around \u00a350 for a gram from a bloke I know who makes it,' he said. 'That lasts me about a month usually. 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy. 'The pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job. 'I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there.' Mr Hibbitt was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer after initially being told he was suffering from piles. Mr Hibbitt, with fiance Heather, said: 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die' After undergoing treatment at the Christie Hospital, in Manchester, the cancer returned and he had another operation in July 2013 followed by more chemotherapy. He was given the all-clear before Christmas that year, but a month later he found a lump, and was told the cancer was in the lymph nodes in his groin. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn't good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'Researchers are collecting patients' experiences to build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabinoid-based drugs in order to gather solid data on whether they benefit people with cancer.' Mr Hibbitt, who works in advertising, added: 'This time they told me there wasn't a lot they could do. 'In July, after doing a lot of research, I got some cannabis oil. I was having chemo, and I was getting to a point where I couldn't really do much, I had no energy. 'In August I decided I'd had enough and I was going to stop the chemotherapy. In October, he had an operation to remove the affected lymph nodes at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. But he chose to carry on taking cannabis oil rather than have any more treatment, deciding against further chemotherapy sessions. Following a scan in January he was given the all-clear - paving the way for him to organise his wedding. Mr Hibbitt, who has a five-year-old son, Ashton, said: 'We never thought this would happen, it's great. Fingers crossed now I will grow old. 'I feel really good and I hope my story will help other people.' His fiance Heather, a nursery nurse, said: 'I didn't want him to take the cannabis oil at first because it's illegal, but I saw the change in him and slowly got used to it. 'He is a determined person and did a lot of research. He wanted to live. 'We are all amazed how well he's done. I can't see my life without him. We have come through a hell of a lot.' Describing the effects of cannabis oil, he said: 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy.The pain just seemed to disappear. I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there' Cancer Research UK says it is aware of patients using cannabis extracts to treat themselves but stressed there is 'no good evidence'  to prove it was safe and effective. The charity is supporting clinical trials into the use of the drug and a synthetic cannabinoid to treat the disease. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours.

But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna\u2019s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair\u2019s popularity. Brookstein\u2019s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It\u2019s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair\u2019s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: \u2018Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.\u2019 Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned \u00a3303,000 in addition to his MP\u2019s salary, mostly from \u00a31,600-an-hour appearances on Iran\u2019s Press TV and Russia Today. The national treasure that is Andrew Marr gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign. \u2018There\u2019s this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life. To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,\u2019 he writes in The Spectator. \u2018They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don\u2019t want to talk about taxation. \u2018The deficit? Apparently if it\u2019s left alone it\u2019s just going to melt away. Huddled-down, risk-averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children.\u2019 Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's 'Controls On Immigration' mug embarrassing . Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour\u2019s embarrassing \u2018Controls On Immigration\u2019 mug at the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in her Sky News interview yesterday. Cooper coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras. \u2018A storm in a coffee cup,\u2019 Cooper, aka Mrs Ed Balls, said. The influential Labour Uncut blog says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon\u2019s claim that Red Ed Miliband \u2018stabbed his own brother in the back\u2019 to lead Labour, and would do the same to Britain by negotiating away Trident, will help the Tories. \u2018The manner in which Ed Miliband defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with Labour canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of Ed Miliband as an untrustworthy leader,\u2019 the website says. \u2018The gutter is an ugly place to be but. . . it\u2019s where elections are won.\u2019 Plaid Cymru is under pressure to dump its candidate for Ceredigion, Mike Parker, for saying in 2001 English-born inhabitants of rural Wales were \u2018gun-toting final solution crackpots\u2019.

The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.",

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video . In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name . This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent . Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base . To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers. On her YouTube profile she writes:  'I use make-up to transform myself into famous celebrities and characters. 'It started out as a hobby 4 years ago and now I am here using this awesome platform to teach and entertain millions around the world.' Promise colours her lips in before adding a Mac lipstick on top - the make-up brand created a collection inspired by the film . Promise uses a pair of tweezers to place false eyelashes onto her eyelid . Her Facebook page states: 'I am not a professional make-up artist nor did take any lessons in it. I am purely self taught!' Along with Disney princesses, she's also transformed herself into the likes of Drake, Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson. In the four minute video Promise talks her viewers through the steps that she took to get her Maleficent look. She uses many products from Mac's Maleficent collection including the eye shadows and eyelashes. Here we look back at some of her other amazing looks... In another look Promise transformed herself into Elsa (left) and Anna (right) from the film Frozen . In this brilliant transformation Promise has turned herself into the rap artist Drake . Here Promise holds a bow and arrow as she tries her hand at being Merida from the film brave . Promise is Princess Esmeralda got this look, when doing her transformations Promise also buys outfits to complete the look . Promise attached facial hair to her chin for this look which saw her become the actor Johnny Depp . With her dark hair and pretty make-up Promise looks just like the character Princess Jasmine from the film Alladin .",

Tanguy Pepiot, a steeplechase runner for the University of Oregon, had a clear lead on his rival Meron Simon, who competes for the University of Washington. But at a track meet Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, a crowd of more than 3,000 people saw the distance evaporate after Pepiot raised his hands in pre-emptive joy, with less than 100m to go. Vanishing lead: Tanguy Pepiot, a runner for the University of Oregon, is pictured left celebrating his victory - and right after he has lost it all to the University of Washington's Meron Simon . Big gains: Pepiot, right, is pictured from track level raising his hands to excite the crowd - as Simon tears toward him from behind . The gesture seemed to sap some of his momentum, opening the way for Simon to speed towards the finish line, and beat him by a tenth of a second. The home crowd roared as Simon powered ahead - seemingly in an attempt to warn French-born Pepiot. But the warning came too late, and Simon flashed past, leaving Pepiot, who is in his senior year, to collapse, defeated. Simon's time, 8:57.86, exceeded his personal record by around 15 seconds. Speaking to the Eugene Register-Guard\u00a0after the contest, a newly-victorious Simon said: 'I thought he had me. Moment of truth: Simon is shown here edging ahead of Pepiot, whom he beat by a tenth of a second . Reconciliation: After celebrating his triumph, Simon headed back to help Pepiot up after he collapsed to the ground in defeat . 'I thought he was just so far ahead. Then I heard the crowd get crazy, and he started throwing his hands up. 'I was like, \"I don\u2019t think he knows I\u2019m coming\". I just went to the line and just raced.' After a justified victory celebration of his own, Simon doubled back to console his rival. Not long after, a defeated Pepiot told columnist Austin Meek: 'I think it was the first time it happened to me. I'll make sure it's the last time.' Personal best: Meron, pictured left at a different event, ran his best ever time in the 3,000m steeplechase. Meanwhile French-born Pepiot, right in a file photo, had pledged not to get cocky again .",

Soil underneath a slide at the park in the Toshima ward in the north-east of the Japanese capital, showed radiation readings of up to 480 microsieverts per hour. This is nearly half the recommended annual limit of exposure for a person. Danger: Japanese authorities detected an unusually high level of radiation around playground equipment in this Tokyo park (pictured) Safety: Authorities cordoned off the park after high levels of radiation were detected underneath a slide . It was not immediately clear why radiation levels were so high in the park, which opened two years after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Authorities believe that the radiation could be coming from something buried underneath the park. The playground has now been fenced off with an orange barricade. Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, members of the public should not be exposed to more than 1000 microsieverts per year. Japan has seen heightened concern over radiation since the 2011 failure of a nuclear plant in Fukushima following an earthquake and tsunami, which led to leaks of radioactive water. In the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks. Thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home in areas closest to Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear plant. Elsewhere, a drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office building this week. Clean up: Workers carry away a container after extremely high levels of radiation were detected in the park . Tests: Following two rounds of testing, officials found high levels of radiation on a section of the equipment .",

Surveillance cameras caught the thief taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut. Thief: Surveillance cameras caught a thief (left) taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan (right) at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014 . Sullivan, who had lung cancer, was informed of the fraud while fighting for her life at\u00a0Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She died five days later. The 50-year-old had worked as a marketing executive for fashion designers Kimora Lee Simmons and Diane von Furstenberg. According to CBS New York, the suspect had Sullivan's Social Security number and a signed copy of her driver's license. Other documents she allegedly used were forged. Sullivan's family was, unsurprisingly, horrified by the news. 'I was just pretty violated and felt kind of helpless standing there with my sister and then knowing that there's some woman trying to clear out her bank account while she lays here fighting for her life,' her sister, Sarah Sullivan, told CBS New York. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut . The thief posed as Sullivan in Chase branches in two Long Island towns. A teller at one of the locations caught the fake documents but the suspect fled before authorities could be called . 'I just want to make sure nobody else goes through what my family's been going through the last couple of months.' In the weeks following Sullivan's death, her sister discovered new store and credit card bills in Sullivan's mail . 'I've had to fax death certificates and affidavits to all of the creditors and fly in to meet with the police and lots of other stuff I didn't need to deal with while I'm mourning my sister's death,' she said. Detectives from New Haven were scheduled to speak with a New York State Police investigator Thursday afternoon, according to city police spokesman Officer David Hartman. Detectives in the New Haven Police Department's Financial Crimes Division were shown a picture of the suspect and none are aware of any connection to open New Haven cases at this time.

Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, had spent his entire life in foster care after\u00a0his mother gave birth to him behind bars. Three years after his emotional plea at St Mark Missionary Baptist Church in St Petersburg he has finally found a permanent home with the woman who first met him as a seven-year-old when she became his caseworker. Scroll down for video . Davion Only, 16, who captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea for a\u00a0family to 'love him forever', has been adopted by his old caseworker Connie Bell Going (right) and her family . Davion plays on the Xbox in his bedroom with his soon-to-be adopted mom Connie sitting behind him together with her daughter Carley, 17, and her adopted son, Taylor, 14 . Throughout Davion's search for a family, and his years in the system, Connie Bell Going, had been by his side. On April 22 she will officially become Davion's mother.\u00a0She admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it. Since August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14. Then in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. Since then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges. 'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told\u00a0the\u00a0Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' Davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.' He then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.' Davion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker,\u00a0Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire life . Davion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a\u00a0family to 'love him forever' Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'. Millions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family. That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system. After Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months. 'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said. Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida. Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year. Davion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children . Going says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone. Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy. 'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said.\u00a0'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?' For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear. The 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier. From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor. Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July . Davion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their\u00a0birthdays,\u00a0which\u00a0fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his\u00a0three\u00a0siblings\u00a0and signed the court papers. After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December .",

'The council immediately looked into the matter and when our concerns were confirmed, Andrew Barr tendered his resignation.' Mr Barr resigned after a student at The Geelong College took the picture of him and shared it with other students using the photosharing app, Snapchat . In a statement, Dr Seward thanked Mr Barr for his contribution to the school since he joined the college in 2013. \u2018In the two years since his appointment, Mr Barr has made an enduring contribution to the College\u2019s educational vision and future planning. The Council is grateful for Mr Barr\u2019s commitment and achievement,' he said. Mr Barr is a former chairman of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and previously served 10 years as principal of Scotch Oakburn College in Melbourne. Dr Seward told the Geelong Advertiser the investigation confirmed Mr Barr had not broken any law and 'at no point' did his actions affect the care provided to students.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nNBC News has changed its account of how chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel was kidnapped in Syria, saying he was now most likely taken by Sunni rebels who tried to convince their victims they were government militants. The broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of Mr Engel, which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed, was carried out by forces associated with President Bashar-al Assad. But Mr Engel has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a Sunni group who had tried to convince their victims that they were Shi-ite rebels affiliated to the Government. Scroll down for video . NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel (centre) was taken captive with Turkey reporter Aziz Akyavas (left) and photographer John Kooistra (right) and were convinced by their captors they had been taken by forces related to President Bashar al-Assad, but they may have been Sunni rebels instead . A statement posted on the NBC News site said: 'The group that kidnapped us put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite Shabiha militiamen.\u00a0The group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances.' The statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight, as they were told, this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes. Instead the captives may just have been handed over. The statement added: 'We have not been able to get a definitive account of what happened that night. But based on all of our reporting, it is clear that we were kidnapped by a criminal gang for money and released for propaganda purposes. 'This, of course, does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous. It does, however, underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside Syria.' Mr Engel and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the New York Times raised questions over the attackers' identities. They suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a Sunni criminal element of the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army and known for taking hostages. The New York Times claimed that NBC executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers' identities during and after Mr Engel was taken. Mr Engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces . But immediately after his release Mr Engel appeared on Today and in a Vanity Fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group, government militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. He made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors, which included that they had been rescued by Sunni rebels. The paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the Assad regime. Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra, were taken hostage on December 13, 2012, while reporting in Syria. The foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a Syrian rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see Iranian and Lebanese prisoners being held by rebels. Syrians run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the Bustan Al-Qasr district of Aleppo . They were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound, blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes. The kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress GPS signal, which informed NBC exactly where they were. \u00a0NBC was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world, also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location. Engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall behind them. It read: \u2018Or will burn.\u2019 A statement published by NBC said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes . During the five days they were held Mr Engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot, and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last. He claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers.\u00a0As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. On the fifth night they were loaded, while blindfolded, into a van. They were told they would be handed over to military forces in  Foua. As they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor. Engel has since said, in light of the new information, this may have been staged to convince them they were rescued rather than handed over. Engel, who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's chief foreign correspondent in 2008.",

Because, according to her, she has cancer. That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nOne of Britain's top entrepreneurs has unveiled a new plan to build a block of flats worth as much as \u00a32billion on the site of an ugly multi-storey car park. John Caudwell, the founder of Phones4U, bought the Audley Street garage in Mayfair, central London for \u00a3155million in order to knock it down and build a high-end housing complex. The new apartment block will contain five townhouses, three penthouses, a mews home and 21 more luxury flats, rivalling properties such as One Hyde Park for the title of the world's most desirable living space. Luxury: Audley Square House is set to be a complex of houses, luxury flats and penthouses in Mayfair, central London . Contrast: Most of the plot is currently taken up by an ugly parking garage which is set to be knocked down by owner John Caudwell . But it could face trouble getting planning permission - as VIP neighbours may object to the building works needed to build four levels of basements as well as nine storeys above the ground. Each townhouse and penthouse will have its own gym and swimming pool, while the penthouses will have dedicated lifts to ensure their owners' privacy. Entrepreneur: The Phones4U founder, pictured with his partner Claire Johnson, is known as a prolific investor in Mayfair property . The development's communal facilities will include a 15-metre swimming pool, a business centre for holding meetings, a gym, spa and cinema and games room. Plans for the ambitious complex were submitted to Westminster Council this week after being put together by US architects RAMSA, which beat 30 rivals to the job. Audley Square House is regarded as a 'super prime' scheme - with one agent saying it could reach \u00a310,000 per sq/ft, valuing it at \u00a32billion in total. Becky Fatemi, director of Rokstone estate agents, said Audley Square House was 'one of the most exciting residential projects ever unveiled in London'. She estimated it would sell for \u00a35,500-\u00a37,000 per sq/ft, rising as high as \u00a310,000 per sq/ft in the next few years. Ms Fatemi said: 'John Caudwell's visionary proposals will replace an unsightly multi-storey concrete car park at 5 Audley Square and convert it into a super-prime residential project. 'The Audley Square project will create a new luxury village for Mayfair and will rival One Hyde Park as London's best luxury address.' Susan Cohen from Mayfair-based Pastor Real Estate said: 'Speculation on plans to develop the Audley Square car park have been going almost as long as I've been in Mayfair, long before the \u00a3150 million deal to purchase the site in 2011. 'There have been many twists and turns, initially refused by the planning officer, Westminster council then overturned this, now the plans have been revised and resubmitted. 'Whatever happens, due to the scale of investment already ploughed into this I don't doubt the finished development will be one of the most super-prime schemes in Mayfair.' Desirable: The complex is set to fetch as much as \u00a32billion in total when it goes on to the market, according to one estate agent . Plan: This map shows how the development will include five townhouses as well as a courtyard garden . Towering: The property will reach nine storeys, as well as four basement levels to be excavated below ground . Mark Tunstall of Tunstall Property added: 'Mayfair is becoming increasingly residential as commercial leases granted after World War II on previously residential addresses come to an end and those properties are reinstated to their original use. 'Yet where it has lagged behind other areas such as Knightsbridge and Belgravia is in its provision of 21st century full-service apartment buildings. 'What Mayfair has lacked until now is a building to rival One Hyde Park and 199 Knightsbridge. Audley Square is set to be a game changer.' Mr Caudwell, 62, has previously described the location as being 'the best site in the world but with some of the ugliest buildings', and promised his stone-clad development will be 'very beautiful'. Contrast: This image shows how the huge building will tower over the street it is on, compared to the modest development there now . Stylish: Mr Caudwell claims that many buildings in the area are very ugly and is keen to restore the district's elegance . Overhaul: The vista will be almost unrecognisable when the complex is built - but it has to get planning permission first . He does not plan to include any affordable housing as part of the complex - and will instead pay Westminster Council more than \u00a38million in compensation. If the property is sold for its maximum price, the Treasury could gain as much as \u00a3100million in stamp duty. However, Ms Fatemi warned that powerful locals might not be happy with the years of building works which would be likely to ensue in the area. 'The project will have a lower ground floor and four basement levels, this will be a major engineering scheme,' she said. 'The neighbours are powerful and include the Embassy of Qatar, the Dorchester Hotel and very wealthy apartment owners who will expect the site construction to be managed to the highest levels to ensure no noise or construction impact and they will expect constantly clean roads.' Map: Another projection of how the finished development will look which was submitted to Westminster Council planners . Eyesore: The current car park is an undistinguished modern building with a monolithic brick frontage . Mr Caudwell has previously made a number of significant investments in Mayfair - he is currently spending millions on converting two houses into a single mega-mansion, and he also owns the house next to Audley Square, which has been rented out for \u00a315,000 per week. A spokesman for the development project declined to comment on the newly revealed plans. Billionaire: Mr Caudwell founded Phones4U and sold his business for \u00a31.5billion . John Caudwell rose from humble beginnings to become one of the wealthiest men in Britain thanks to the Phones4U business empire. He left school before taking his A-levels and worked as an apprentice at Michelin - but while working at the tyre firm, he started a mail-order business selling clothing to motorbike fans. Mr Caudwell was living in a caravan when he and his brother cooked up a plan to sell mobile phones, then considered an expensive luxury with huge profit margins. In 1987 He bought 26 phones from Motorola and took eight months to sell them all, but that turned out to be the origins of a company which would help define the burgeoning mobile market. Nearly 20 years later, Mr Caudwell cashed out by selling the last of his businesses for \u00a31.5billion, and at that point he became a noted philanthropist, giving to causes such as the NSPCC and the Bomber Command memorial. He has a son with his partner Claire Johnson, as well as four other children from previous relationships. Last year his son Rufus revealed that he was struggling with agoraphobia, and finds it almost impossible to leave the house. As well as his properties in Mayfair, Mr Caudwell owns 50-room Broughton Hall in Staffordshire, where he is currently building a private miniature railway to transport him and his guests around the estate.",

The veteran host was attempting to warm up the studio audience ahead of his show on Monday when he made the off-colour gag. Letterman had just opened up questions to the floor, and fielded the first query of the night from a college employee, reported the\u00a0New York Post. They asked what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates. Letterman, who was in 2009 forced to admit to string of affairs, said:\u00a0'Treat a lady like a wh\u2013e, and a wh\u2013e like a lady.' But the joke received a frosty\u00a0reception from the shocked crowd. After being met with stunned silence, the host attempted to recover by offering further advice to graduates to 'eat salad' and 'always be nice'. However, several audience members at the Ed Sullivan Theater were furious over the sexist joke. Retired Jerry Stockton, from Virginia, called it 'disrespectful to women' while another, who would not be named, said it had been an 'odd choice' for the first joke of the evening. The gag is thought to have been a reference to a saying by 1930s screenwriter Wilson Mizner. Scroll down for video . Joe Logan, 41, from Pennsylvania, told the New York Post:\u00a0'Younger people watch his show. We already live in a culture that objectifies women, it's not right to make a joke like that.' A Letterman spokesman said he could not 'confirm the accuracy' of Monday's failed joke and would not comment further. But a source close to the show insisted 'It got a big laugh.' Letterman carried on with the show which had guests including John Travolta and Amy Schumer, star of her eponymous Comedy Central show, 'Inside Amy Schumer.' Old friends: David thanked John for being his friend over the decades during Monday's show. It was during a Monday warm up that he made the gag . The Grease actor, 61, had tried to bring his son Ben on to meet his 'old friend' Letterman but the nervous youngster had fled the stage into his mother's arms. The host later offered some advice to Schumer and instructed her to 'do something now that you'll regret.' So the comedienne immediately lifted her dress and flashed... her surfing scar to a relieved-looking Letterman. In October 2009, the veteran host of the Late Show had been forced to admit to a string of affairs live on air  by a blackmailing producer. The host made the shocking revelation on his show that he had cheated on his wife, Regina Lasko, whom he had only married that March. He made the confession after becoming the victim of an extortion plot concocted by a then-CBS producer, Robert Halderman, who demanded $2 million in exchange for his silence over the affairs. Letterman is now planning to retire from the show after more than 20 years of hosting on May 20. Good times: David rubbed his forehead while Amy cracked up after he told her to do something she'd regret .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nCharlie Adam looked up, noticed Thibaut Courtois was off his line, and thought: \u2018Why not?\u2019 Why not, indeed. The Stoke City midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the Barclays Premier League\u2019s strike of the season. David Beckham did it against Wimbledon in August 1996, as did Wayne Rooney against West Ham last March. There was Xabi Alonso in 2006 and Maynor Figueroa three years later, too. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Yet this was different. It was not a hit and hope. It was not a lob. This was a direct shot from deep inside Adam\u2019s own half which fooled one of the world\u2019s greatest goalkeepers \u2014 and Adam meant it. Sportmail\u2019s Jamie Redknapp agreed. \u2018This is better than Beckham, more audacious than Rooney\u2019s last season, This is one of the best strikes we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s an absolutely incredible piece of play by Charlie Adam. \u2018You categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals, but that was a piece of genius. To even try it is brilliant.\u2019 Even by the standards those at Stamford Bridge are used to seeing week in, week out, this was special. Particularly because it came from an unexpected source, from a \u2018bloke who looks like a bus driver\u2019, as former English cricket captain Freddie Flintoff colourfully put it. Nineteen years ago, when Beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line, he did so wearing the wrong footwear. The Manchester United great beat Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan wearing custom-made boots embroidered with \u2018Charlie\u2019 on the tongue \u2014 adidas sending Beckham a pair which were actually intended for Rangers attacking midfielder Charlie Miller. Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game . David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . Chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the Premier League. Liverpool were the first and have now scored 102. Miller never got his boots as they were retired, turned into a museum piece, having helped Beckham towards his first of 115 England caps less than three weeks later against Moldova. From one Scottish Charlie to another, Adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from Stamford Bridge, but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool midfielder as it was for Beckham. Yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net, Adam disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original. \u2018The manager kept saying to me, \u201ccome in the middle of the pitch\u201d, to try to get on the ball,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018I\u2019m not a winger, I\u2019m not a wide left midfielder, I don\u2019t have the pace to go in behind so I\u2019ve seen an opening, I\u2019ve seen the goalie off his line and I thought, \u201cwhy not do it at a place like Chelsea?\u201d 'I\u2019ve seen the goalie back-pedalling and I was praying it would go in. I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my career.\u2019 From Spain\u2019s Marca to Italy\u2019s La Gazzetta dello Sport, the goal has been admired worldwide. One man who does not want to see it again, however, is Jose Mourinho. It left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, yet even the Chelsea manager can admire a wonder-goal when one comes along, as much as it hurts to admit it. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had to admit that Adam's goal was a strike of the highest quality . Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . \u2018It was a fantastic goal, every player in the world would like to score a goal like that,\u2019 Mourinho said. \u2018Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi to all these brilliant players. Not all of them did score that goal in their careers.\u2019 Maradona, Messi, and Adam. Unlike the Argentinian greats, he is known more for his heavy tackling, as Gareth Bale found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in May 2011. Yet this was straight from the Pele playbook. Stoke had not managed a single shot on target with half-time minutes away and there seemed no danger as Adam picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half. Courtois mistakenly thought the same. Yet this is nothing new from Adam. He did it for Blackpool reserves previously, and Ross County, too. Asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game, Adam said: \u2018Every time.\u2019 Midway through this interview, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba interrupts. \u2018Why?\u2019 he asks Adam in mock indignation. \u2018Tell me why?\u2019 To which Adam replies: \u2018I watch your videos.\u2019 Indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on YouTube and, on Saturday, Adam rightly earned his place in history among them.",

Bill Dudley, Europe's oldest McDonald's employee, celebrating his 90th birthday at the outlet in Mold, Flintshire, where he works two days a week . Great grandfather and Second World War veteran Bill celebrates his special with fellow employees at McDonald's in Mold. He joined the team nine years ago after growing 'bored' pottering around the house . Wife Margaret, 71, has nicknamed her hubby Old McDonald. Bill's special day on Wednesday was marked with a cake and tickets for a weekend away. McDonalds hailed the great-grandfather as 'a real asset' to the team. 'I didn't expect such a nice surprise,' Bill said. 'But I suppose it's not every day that you turn 90. 'I still enjoy working. I come here two days-a-week, which not only gets me out of the house but I honestly love it.

Sexual assault charges against a Chicago Uber driver have been dropped after prosecutors heard a secret recording he made of his passenger the night of the alleged attack. Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, was charged in December with kidnapping and raping a female passenger he picked up after she ordered an UberX ride the month before. The 22-year-old woman told police she was intoxicated \u00a0and fell in and out of consciousness during the ride with Fohounhedo. She alleged that she eventually woke up in Fohounhedo's apartment as he was having sex with her, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The woman told police he then helped her into his car and drove her home. She called police the next day and a rape kit was administered at Swedish Covenant Hospital, the\u00a0Chicago Tribune\u00a0reported. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, claims the woman made a pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place.' 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' Yassin said. According to Yassin, Fohounhedo made the nine-minute recording as he drove the woman home because 'he had a gut feeling he needed to protect himself'. 'She was having a friendly conversation with him,' Yassin said. 'And talking about her boyfriend and her work, and gave him a hug in the end.' Yassin said when Fohounhedo helped the woman out of his car she said 'thank you so much'. The attorney said prosecutors authenticated the recording after Fohounhedo turned over his phone. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, said the woman made the pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place'. 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' he said. Fohounhedo's wife Sheena (right) said the couple will have to work to get past the incident . Fohounhedo was released from Cook County Jail on Monday night. He has spent the last four months behind bars. Sheena Fohounhedo, his wife, told\u00a0ABC 7\u00a0the couple will have to work to get past the incident but that she is happy her husband is coming home . Fohounhedo was using his wife's Uber account, which is a violation of the company's policy, when he picked up the 22-year-old woman. Uber removed Fohounhedo from the service after he was charged with assault. Yassin said his client wasn't given a chance and that 'everybody immediately thought he was guilty'. He said Fohounhedo has no ill will against Uber but does not plan to work with the company again. Fohounhedo was just one of several Uber drivers who have been accused of sexual assault since the app was launched in the US in 2011. Another woman in Chicago sued the company earlier this year after her driver allegedly locked her in the car and groped her breast, legs and groin before she escaped.",

The men were part of a group of five divers from the East Coast and San Francisco. Ten friends, including the dead men, had rented a house on Caspar Cove 160 miles north of San Francisco to hunt for abalone, a rare and expensive mollusk that is prized as a delicacy. The Santa Rosa Press Democrat\u00a0reports that the accident in Mendocino County is the deadliest single incident involving abalone divers in recent memory. Witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough, choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby. Abalone is a prized delicacy that sells for up to $70 per pound. The annual abalone season brings divers out into the rough waters of northern California (stock image) The three men died after diving into rough waters off of rocky coastline in Mendocino County, California, on Sunday in search of abalone (stock imagine of abalone diver) Firefighters said the men dove into water in Caspar Cove and found themselves immediately in trouble. An off-duty firefighter who happened to be fishing nearby spotted the men and called for help. The three men who drowned were overcome by the churning water and crushed against the sharp rocks on shore. Rescuers managed to pull the two survivors and one of the dead men from the water immediately after arriving on scene. A Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office helicopter plucked the second victim from the sea and brought him to shore. Ten friends from the East Coast and San Francisco rented a house on Caspar Cove to dive for abalone, locals said. Five of them went out on Sunday - three died . Firefighters performed CPR on the two drowned men on the beach as his horrified friends watched - but both were pronounced dead on Sunday afternoon. The third man's body was found after a five-hour search that involved aircraft and boats from several fire departments and sheriff's offices, as well as the US Coast Guard. He was smashed against rocks in a cove, which required rescuers to hoist his body up the cliff with a winch because they couldn't get to him by water. Local authorities say the abalone season, which started April 1, is always marred by several rescues and often a few death.

Larry Kramer, 79, says he believes what's written in his history book is true though he is selling it as fiction to avoid legal troubles. In Volume One of his two part book 'The American People,' Kramer says that Abraham Lincoln was gay and his killer John Wilkes Booth was actually Lincoln's spurned gay lover. 'We know that Abraham Lincoln was gay,' Kramer told CBS in an interview about the book which came out this month. Were they gay?: Writer and gay activist Larry Kramer claims that Abraham Lincoln (left) and George Washington (right) were gay . The American People: Volume one of the two part book by Larry Kramer explores prehistoric America's unwritten gay history up to the present day . Abraham Lincoln . According to Larry Kramer, Abraham Lincoln slept with several men including\u00a0actor John Wilkes Booth\u00a0who later fatally shot him in a theater on April 14, 1965. Kramer claims that the motive for murder was not Booth's anger over the Civil War but was his unrequited love for the former president. Another indicator that Lincoln was gay is that he would share beds with other men, especially when his wife Mary left town. One such man was\u00a0Captain\u00a0David Derickson who would visit Lincoln at a retreat from\u00a0the White House called the Soldier's Home. Lincoln has been quoted as saying of Derickson, 'The captain and I are getting quite thick.' George Washington . Larry Kramer says that historians just don't have 'gaydar' when it comes to studying historic figures and that George was was 'basically a big queen.' Larry Kramer said in an interview with Sirius that George\u00a0Washington\u00a0loved decorating battle gear and that he was a bit of a dandy in his love of showmanship. 'In the case of Washington, he was a big queen, basically,' Kramer said. 'He decorated everything. He designed all the uniforms, the buttons. The correspondence exists with all the dealers he dealt with in England to make everything. And then there was a man called Baron Von Steuben, who was German, who designed all the maneuvers for all the troops of all the great armies in Europe. And he kept getting thrown out after he made the armies real \u2013 like Rockettes . He got kicked out and he came to George. And he and George hit it off like nobody\u2019s business.' Alexander Hamilton . According to Kramer, Alexander Hamilton was in love with George Washington claims the pair had an erotic father and son attraction. Alexander Hamilton was also supposedly involved with a young officer named John Laurens to whom he wrote 'love letters. ' 'You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent. But as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have artfully instilled into me,' said one of those letters to Laurens. In another letter to Laurens, Hamilton calls himself, 'a jealous lover.' Men of Jamestown . Even though sodomy was considered taboo at the time, Larry Kramer says that a lack of women in Jamestown led many men to experiment with one another in their absence. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Larry Kramer of the initially all male settlement. 'Why is that not in the history books? Because all history books are written by straight people, and they don't wanna either admit that, or they wouldn't know how to recognize what we call 'gaydar.' According to Kramer, Jamestown was a mecca of gay sex where men chose to sleep with men because there weren't any women around. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Kramer. Kramer says it took him 40 years to write his 800 page history book that spans from pre-historic america all the way to the 1950s. 'It's called a 'novel,' but that's just to keep the lawyers away from me,' Kramer said. 'I believe everything in the book is true. Everything in there happened,' said Kramer who has long wanted to write a book on gay history. Spurned lover: Larry Kramer claims John Wilkes Booth, who murdered Abraham Lincoln, was one of Lincoln's spurned male lovers . The writer: Larry Kramer, 79, is an HIV positive American writer and gay rights advocate who spent 40 years writing his most recent book . 'It may look like fiction, but to me, it\u2019s not,' Kramer told the New York Times. 'Most histories have been written by straight people. There has never been any history book written where the gay people have been in the history from the beginning.It\u2019s ridiculous to think we haven\u2019t been here for ever.' Kramer says that John Wilkes Booth's murder had nothing to do about the outcome of the Civil war, rather Bookes felt spurned by the president. Kramer's book doesn't only touch on the gay history of politicians but it also talks about the about the HIV crisis in the nation which will be the book's second volume. Kramer, who is HIV positive, said that 35 years is too long for a plague like HIV to still be in existence. 'You'll hear all about the plague of AIDS in the second volume, and a lot about Ronald Reagan,' Kramer said. 'It's not a nice story, but it's one that needs to be told. If I've been kept alive for any reason, it was to tell this story.'",

While this was the first time the public were able to check out Mick in action in his new car, his pre-season practice didn't quite go to plan as he was involved in a 100mph crash last month. However, German newspaper Bild reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who is still recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven 91 races in Formula 1, and Mick's boss Frits van Amersfoort says the youngster will need time. 'Of course we know that his father is a seven time world champion,' he said. 'But I want to emphasise that Mick will take the time to learn the trade of the racing driver.' Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4 in March, and links up with team-mate Harrison Newey, the son of the Red Bull designer Adrian.

The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering the race as a 'leftist' alternative to Clinton in the hopes that this will see him represent the party in the 2016 elections. This claims come in the wake of a television appearance last week, just hours before Clinton announced her candidacy, where de Blasio refused to back her. Scroll down for video . The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering preparing to run for president as a 'leftist' alternative to Hillary Clinton, according to a source within the Democratic Party . De Blasio's intentions to throw his hat in the ring as Democrat presidential candidate comes from a 'national party operative', according to the New York Post. The mayor's bid for presidency is backed by the Working Families Party, and he hopes that left-leaning 'progressive activists' will join them in supporting him over the coming months, the source claims. 'De Blasio and his advisers are trying to position the mayor as the 'draft' candidate for the left in 2016. That's why he refused to endorse Hillary last week,' the party operative told the Post. The 53-year-old has yet to back Clinton, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000, an indication that the rumours of his intentions to run for president may be true. The New York City mayor, known to be more liberal than Clinton on most issues, surprised many Democrats when he declined to endorse his former boss during an interview last week. Behind her back? Bill de Blasio has yet to endorse Hillary Clinton as the Democrats' presidential candidate, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000 . The New York City mayor, seen inspecting a Bronx apartment as pary of an affordable housing project, said he will not endorse Clinton  until he can 'see an actual vision of where they want to go' Appearing on Meet The Press, De Blasio said he would withhold his blessing 'until I see an actual vision of where they want to go.' 'She's a tremendous public servant,' the mayor continued. 'I think she is one of the most qualified people to ever run for this office. And by the way, thoroughly vetted, we can say that. But we need to see the substance.' De Blasio has taken several steps to raise his profile in recent weeks, including making a bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention, hosting a meeting of liberals at Gracie Mansion this month and traveling to Nebraska and Iowa \u2014 site of the first nominating caucus \u2014 \u00a0last  week to champion the fight against income inequality. Today, Clinton is scheduled to arrive in New Hampshire as she steps up her campaign for the Democratic nomination. As she did in Iowa last week, Clinton plans to forgo the packed rallies that marked her previous campaign and focus on smaller round-table events with selected groups of supporters.",

But in his life, 50-year-old Walter Scott was also the father of four children and served in the Coast Guard before being honorably discharged. \"He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody,\" his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon. \"All the family loves him, and his kids loved him.\" Until it all came crashing down Saturday morning, when North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run. Why did he run? Justin Bamberg, a lawyer for Scott's family, speculated Thursday it could have been related to \"child support and a fear of maybe going back to (jail).\" At the time of his death, Scott owed over $18,000 in back payments for two children and hadn't made a payment since July 2012, according to Charleston County family court documents. Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years. \"I know that it had nothing to do with anything violent,\" Bamberg said of Scott's legal history. \"He was not a dangerous person.\" According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun. Slager fired eight shots, five of which struck Scott. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, \"running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty,\" Stewart said. Slager has been charged with murder, a charge that might not have come about if not for a bystander's video of the shooting. Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family. \"When I saw that video for the first time, my family was deeply hurt that someone would gun down a human being in that way,\" the brother said. \"We just couldn't believe it.\" The last time the family got together with Walter Scott was when the siblings threw a surprise wedding anniversary party for their parents. \"It was a great celebration,\" Anthony Scott said. \"My dad and brothers planned it, and (my mother) was totally surprised. \"Now this happens,\" Scott said, referring to his brother's shooting. \"It's so tragic.\" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

The Ukip leader said anti-English sentiment in Scotland was now the 'biggest' form of racism in the UK. H\u200ee said Mr Salmond had made the problem worse and said it was wrong that Ukip is called racist. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, pictured today giving a speech in Harrogate, said the SNP was 'openly racist', accusing Alex Salmond (right) of fuelling resentment . Speaking during a visit to Hartlepool, Mr Farage said: ''The biggest racism I have seen in British politics is happening north of the border where some of the anti-english hatred is reaching a truly astonishing level. 'T\u200ehe SNP are openly racist. The anti-English hostility and the kind of language that is used about and towards English people is totally extraordinary. 'If my supporters behaved in the way that some of those pro-independence supporters behaved in the referendum I'd have been painted out to be the worst person that had been seen for 70 years in British politics.' Asked if being anti-English was the same as being racist, Mr Farage said: 'When I say that I don't think we should have an open door to Poland, Latvia and Lithuania I'm accused of being racist and yet when it's the Scots being rude about the English you don't think it is. 'The fact is Ukip is a non-racist non-sectarian political party and we've got more members of black and ethnic minority standing for us than the Green Party or the Liberal Democrats. We're an all embracing party.' Mr Farage addressed supporters at the Grand Hotel, in Hartlepool, \u00a0as he stepped up his election push in the north of England . Nigel Farage has said he is 'astonished' by how little clothing women in Newcastle wear on a night out. The Ukip leader said it showed that people in the North East are 'particularly tough'. During a visit to Hartlepool, he said: 'The last time I went out in Newcastle was about 18 months ago and I think it was February or March and I think it was completely astonished to see how little clothing people wear in this part of the world. 'There were girls with platform shoes like that, dresses here, blokes in T-shirts and I can only conclude that although we are all from the same country you are particularly tough up here.' Mr Farage accused the former Scottish first minister of not doing enough to counter the problem. He said: 'I think the one I blame is Alex Salmond. When I was attacked by a group of thugs in the street in Edinburgh with the most extraordinary anti-English sentiments being shouted, when Salmond was asked whether he condemned that \u200ebehaviour he didn't. 'I think it is ironic that all the talk about extremism within British politics is pointed towards Ukip when there are others who are far more guilty.' Asked if Nicola Sturgeon was also to blame, Mr Farage added: 'She hasn't done anything to stop it, but I haven't heard her say anything to encourage it.\u200e' But SNP MSP Humza Yousaf hit back at the Ukip leader's 'politics of fear and intolerance'. He said: 'These disgraceful comments - which aren't just offensive to the SNP, but to the majority of people in Scotland on current polls - show exactly why the people of Scotland reject Ukip. 'Nigel Farage's politics of fear and intolerance have been exposed in this campaign, and he has still not apologised for David Coburn MEP comparing me to a convicted terrorist merely because I am a Muslim. 'The SNP have been clear that we will be a positive voice for people across the UK - and with progressive policies such as ending austerity to invest in public services and our NHS, we can bring real change north and south of the border. 'All Ukip have to offer is nasty rhetoric.' Mr Farage said both Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Salmond had failed to act to quell resentment between the English and Scots . Mr Farage also dismissed a claim from Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna that Ukip is infected with the 'virus of racism'. He said Mr Umunna, who he labelled 'the high priest of the liberal metropolitan elite', had made the comment because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Hartlepool, which has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974, is Ukip's main target seat in the North East at the general election . In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour's Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage's hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as 'H'Angus the Monkey', Hartlepool United FC's mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, 'free bananas for schoolchildren'. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy.",

Diego Costa (centre) has been ruled out for up to the next four weeks after injuring his hamstring vs Stoke .

But Mourinho says Costa will be fit enough to face the final four games of the season, starting with the clash against Crystal Palace on May 3. 'Only Diego is injured, everybody else is fine and ready,' Mourinho said during the club's pre-match press conference on Friday. '[John Obi] Mikel is ready. [Cesc] Fabregas with a mask, but ready too. No problems. 'We have eight matches to play, if he [Costa] plays four it's normal,' Mourinho said. 'If he plays three it's a little bit below what I'm expecting. If he plays five it's more than I'm expecting.' Costa has a history of hamstring problems but Mourinho is refusing to let his focus shift from Sunday's game at Loftus Road. Asked whether he was concerned about the former Atletico Madrid forward's latest injury, the Chelsea boss said: 'Not concerned. I'm concerned about the match on Sunday. 'At this moment I don't want to think of him (Costa) for two, three weeks.' Blues boss Jose Mourinho (left) hopes to have Costa back for their final four games of the season .",

Roberto Mancini has Liverpool midfielder Leiva and Barcelona's Song, currently on loan at West Ham, on his list of alternatives if Jovetic and Toure prove too costly. Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told Sky Italia: 'Dreams are beautiful, I'm trying to prepare something and I hope my dreams come true. Lucas Leiva (left) is believed to be a target for Inter Milan and could leave Liverpool in the summer . Alex Song has impressed during his loan spell at West Ham United and would be available for a transfer . 'Jovetic? In the past there was something, especially last summer. We had gone quite a bit forward in the negotiations, we were hoping to conclude the deal but then Negredo became injured and Manchester City changed their minds. 'He is a great player, he fits the profile of the player we are looking for. He is not very young but he is fully mature and still has a lot to give. He is a very talented player but the English club buys very often but seldom sells.' Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony. The Premier League champions rejected several bids from Inter last summer, while Juventus showed interest in the Montenegro star during the last transfer window. Roberto Mancini remains keen on the Manchester City duo he worked with while he was at the club . Yaya Toure (left) and Stevan Jovetic both look set to leave the club in the summer and Inter are keen . Toure, meanwhile, has been heavily linked with a move this summer and Mancini made his admiration known for the Ivorian earlier this month. Mancini said: 'Yaya has played in every top League, apart from Germany and Italy. 'If, as it seems, he wants to have an experience in Italy, then there is this possibility he could come here. 'It won\u2019t be easy, but he\u2019s a player with incredible technique and character. Would Inter be his first choice? That\u2019s certain.'",

A controlling Afghanistan veteran who beat his girlfriend and banned her from wearing revealing clothes has been jailed for a two-year-long campaign of terror. Royal Marine Bobby Burnett forced Samantha Chudley to stop wearing make-up because he wanted to make her less\u00a0attractive to other men, and forced her to hand over the passwords of her e-mail and social media accounts so he could monitor them,\u00a0Exeter Crown Court heard. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her\u00a0smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home. His violence and the stress of his controlling behaviour led her to have two miscarriages, one of which happened days after he punched her in the stomach when she was ten weeks pregnant, the court was told. The otherwise exemplary Marine's personality changed because he was taking a powerful illegal steroid\u00a0normally given to beef cattle to make them increase body mass, the court was told. He told police she was lying about his repeated assaults but inquiries\u00a0showed he had asked the Marines for help to control his domestic violence. And checks on his mobile phone showed hundreds of texts in which he begged her\u00a0to forgive his attacks and promised to stop hitting her. Burnett was a Marine with an exemplary service record who has been thrown\u00a0out of the Corps after a routine drug screen showed he was taking steroids. Burnett, 30, who has been in custody since leaving the Commando Training\u00a0Centre, admitted aggravated harassment and making threats to kill and was\u00a0jailed for two years and two months by Judge Phillip Wassall. He told him: 'Miss Chudley lost all confidence in herself. She was even\u00a0having to check with you what she could wear and you began to chastise her\u00a0for wearing make up. 'If she ever questioned you, your response was to attack her, grabbing her\u00a0by the neck, holding her up against walls, putting her to the floor and\u00a0telling her to shut up. 'She says the assaults happened on a weekly basis although you say there\u00a0were longer periods between attacks when you could control your temper. 'This was a relationship where you set out to control her by violence to the\u00a0extent her will was completely broken and she became completely subservient\u00a0to your control over the best part of two years. 'You were not only abusing alcohol but taking steroids at the time and it is\u00a0well known they can cause bad temper and cause violence. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home, the court was told . 'This was a protracted history of very serious domestic violence. The\u00a0aggravating features are the continued and repeated threats and extreme\u00a0domestic violence. 'You now acknowledge your responsibility and I believe you have had a change\u00a0of heart and are far less dangerous than you were. It is an attribute of\u00a0your steroid abuse that it played some part in your behaviour.' The judge made a restraining order banning Burnett from contacting Miss\u00a0Chudley ever again. Miss Emily Pitts, prosecuting, said texts recovered from Burnett's phone\u00a0showed the domination he asserted over his partner. One said: 'I won't\u00a0change. You will always have to live by my rules and do what I say.' She only left him after two years of repeated assaults and his increasing\u00a0domination in which he would attack her and call her a s**g if she wore make\u00a0up or attractive clothes. Miss Pitts said his attacks and bullying led to Miss Chudley becoming a shell of her normal self and feeling worthless and enslaved. Miss Pitts said: 'She went through months and months of torture. He would go\u00a0out of his way to make her feel like she was nothing. 'She says she felt worthless and he destroyed all her confidence. Friends\u00a0told her they did not recognise her as the same person while she was under\u00a0his control. 'He would constantly question her about where she was and who she was with\u00a0and installed a tracking app on her phone. She felt sick and trapped. 'She is petrified that when he is released she will become the focus of his\u00a0rage at the fact that his life has fallen apart and will find her and hurt\u00a0her or even kill her.' Mr Barry White, defending, said that since acknowledging his guilt Burnett\u00a0is a changed man who is determined to address the issues which led him to\u00a0treat Miss Chudley as he did. He provided references from Burnett's previous partner and a new girlfriend,\u00a0both of whom say he has behaved well towards them. He also provided testimonials from the Marines showing an unblemished 11\u00a0year record in which he saw action in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the 2011\u00a0operation in Libya. He said: 'He went off kilter. This relationship was toxic and dysfunctional\u00a0and he knows he carries the burden of responsibility for that.'",

A former Celtic star tried to dodge performing unpaid work for shoplifting from Harrods - after claiming it would disrupt his search for a new club. Andre Blackman, 24, who now plays for doomed Championship side Blackpool FC, stole a jacket worth more than \u00a31,000 from the world famous store in Knightsbridge. Blackman, who has been told he is \u2018surplus to requirements\u2019 by Tangerines boss Lee Clark, described the offence as a \u2018moment of madness.\u2019 He was ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after Hammersmith Magistrates\u2019 Court was told he fled from the shop with the \u00a31,225 jacket. He was arrested shortly afterwards and the jacket was recovered. Blackman told Deputy District Judge Samantha Mace: \u2018It was just a moment of madness. It was not something that I intended to do, or something I do regularly. \u2018I\u2019m just absolutely speechless.\u2019 Blackman told the judge his attempts to find a new club might be hindered if he was forced to carry out community work. He said the travelling to different clubs would be the biggest problem. Explaining his situation, he said: \u2018I have got my current agent looking around on my behalf and there have been a few clubs that might be interested. \u2018And because we are closer to the end of the season they are just waiting to see whether they are going down or staying up.\u2019 \u2018Once I do work for a club I would have to come back to the court and say that something has come up.\u2019 Judge Mace told Blackman, who temporarily resides in a hotel in Blackpool using the \u00a3125 living allowance he receives from the club, that he would be more than capable of carrying out unpaid work before the new season begins. Blackman has already played for 11 clubs in his short career. Blackpool defender Blackman has played just three Championship games for the Tangerines this season . Blackman has been told by Blackpool boss Lee Clark that he is surplus to requirements at Bloomfield Road . He played for Arsenal\u2019s academy between 2001-06, and Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s between 2006-07. Blackman signed his first professional contract with Bristol City in 2009, making his debut in a League Cup match against Brentford in August 2009, before playing for AFC Wimbledon, Celtic, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Plymouth Argyle, Dover, Maidenhead, and most recently Blackpool. He was awarded \u2018Tackle of the Year\u2019 at Celtic when he accidentally collided with manager Neil Lennon during a match, sending him crashing into the turf . Judge Mace told Blackman his offending was at the \u2018lower end\u2019 of the spectrum, and that 40 hours of unpaid work could be completed before September. She added that if the order really hinders him from finding a new club then he can apply to the court to be sentenced in another way. Judge Mace said \u2018Because you haven\u2019t been signed by a club just yet, you should be able to complete the hours before the new season, and if you really really can\u2019t do it you can make an application to the court to deal with sentence in another way.\u2019 The judge ordering him to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order and to pay \u00a385 in costs. \u2018As I have said, because the goods were of a high value, the fact you do have a similar conviction - albeit a long time ago - and the fact that you did try to run away from the shop before being apprehended by the police, this makes it serious enough to merit a community order. \u2018In the present circumstances I do think it\u2019s appropriate for such an order to be made. \u2018It would be far more serious if you had not pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.\u2019 Blackman, of Edymion Road, Brixton, southwest London, must complete his community service by April next year.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA former commander of the Metropolitan Police's elite Flying Squad has said the Hatton Garden gem heist could be linked to the huge underground fire which ripped through London last week. The massive fire started  last Wednesday and took more than 24 hours to put out. John O'Connor, a highly experienced former police detective, has claimed the major power outage and the proximity of the multi-million burglary was far more than a coincidence. Scroll down for video . A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . It came shortly after firefighters  battled a major fire in Holborn - just 500 metres from the raid site . Speaking on LBC, Mr O'Connor said: 'Yeah, I think that probably was deliberate. 'I've never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that. That seems to me as too much of a coincidence.' He also said that in his opinion, to succeed with such a complicated and ambitious crime, the gang must have had some inside help. He added: 'You're gonna have to have a detailed layout of the whole of the business. So clearly they got that from somebody on the inside.' He later told Sky News: 'You've got a major strong room, there's no sign of a forced entry, they've apparently been able to abseil down the lift shaft to get access to the vault - I just find it astonishing that it was that easy. 'The fact that there is no sign of forced entry, what does that mean? That someone left the door open? That someone left the windows open? Former head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, John O'Connor, pictured, said the Holborn fire and the raid could be linked . 'It smacks all the time of inside aid, all of the way through it. This doesn't look to me like a genuine sort of smash and grab raid by determined criminals, this looks like they've had accomplices on the inside.You wouldn't go to attack a building like that unless you knew you could gain access.' The London Fire Brigade said they do not believe that the blaze was caused deliberately. Fire experts said their initial assessment showed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the Victorian tunnels running below ground, damaging an eight inch gas main which ruptured and fuelled the flames. Fresh details of the daring heist emerged yesterday as police forensic teams continued to sift through the rubble in the vault. It is believed an alarm was triggered when the professional gang broke into the building in the heart of London\u2019s jewellery district. A security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the property on Good Friday before leaving when he found nothing untoward. Police have refused to say whether officers were despatched to investigate around the same time. The gang used a heavy-duty drill weighing 77lb to bore through a reinforced 7ft concrete wall to reach the vault. When the raid was discovered on Tuesday, police discovered cheaper jewels left strewn amid a large heap of rubble in the vault. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad said: \u2018I\u2019d say it\u2019s a sophisticated offence and clearly it would have taken some pre-planning. It\u2019s organised. It\u2019s people who have planned it and they know how they were going to go about it. \u2018I would imagine that the pool of people [who could carry out the heist] is quite limited.\u2019 The  fire started underground just several hundred yards from where the heist took place a few days later . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . It has also emerged that celebrities and Premier League footballers could be among the victims of the thieves. A source told the Daily Mail: \u2018At least two of the jewellers have gems in the vault which have been bought by footballers and celebrities. They are waiting nervously to find out if they are among the victims.\u2019 Mr Johnson described how the gang gained access to one of the offices on the second floor of the building where they disabled the lift before climbing down. Once in the basement the thieves forced open the lift doors to get close to the vault. They used a \u00a33,500 Hilti DD350 drill, which is commonly used on large construction sites, to drill through the reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault. Joel Vinsant, secretary of the Drilling and Sawing Association, said that even with high-tech equipment, it may have taken hours for the thieves to drill through the concrete. He said: \u2018What they might have done is to bore several holes with a rig-based drill until they had made a space big enough to get through, rather than boring one hole and breaking through. It could have taken up to an hour per hole.\u2019 Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Police yesterday revealed the thieves used a Hilti DD 350 drill to get through the two-metre thick vault walls . During the raid the gang used an angle grinder and crowbars to force their way into 70 deposit boxes to steal the gems and cash inside. They then made their escape before employees arriving for work on Tuesday spotted the raid. Mr Johnson added: \u2018The scene is chaotic. The vault is covered in dust and debris and the floor is strewn with discarded safety deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars. \u2018There is no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building. We are in the process of identifying the owners of the safety deposit boxes and contacting them to take statements and find out what has been stolen.\u2019 He said his team had only just reached the vault because of the amount of debris at the scene. Mr Johnson added: \u2018It\u2019s got to be a slow, painstaking and methodical forensic process to get in there.\u2019 Experts fear the thieves may have already smuggled the jewels out of the country and are planning to cut up the larger gems to make it easier to sell them on the black market. One jeweller who rents a deposit box said police have identified the owners of 30 boxes which had been broken into. Furious jewellery dealers today accused the manager of the safe deposit of 'gross negligence'. Pictured: Felix Stephens (left) and\u00a0Gerald Landon (right)",

The Southwest Airlines flight which was scheduled to leave  Midway International Airport at 1.15pm was delayed for almost two hours due to the 'disturbance'. The Chicago Fire Department was called to evaluate Mr Modarkski after he was stabbed in the arm. Mr Mordarski said he would not be pressing charges following the incident. His best friend, photographer Michael Sutton, said the pen stabbing began after Lenny's arm brushed up against the woman while he slept. Mr Sutton, 41, told Daily Mail Online: 'She took her pen and stabbed his arm several times causing him to yell out in pain. 'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment. 'Luckily he wore a thick long sleeve shirt or there would have been blood. He will have a few bruises in the morning. 'The passengers cheered when they heard she wasn't coming back on.' Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight.

David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.' Armstrong said there's been no attempt to meet with Howman since 2013.",

The latest report shows that he sped up the descent of the plane to its doom. It's terrifying. As the investigation unfolds, we will learn more about to what extent Lubitz kept his mental illness secret, or how much help he sought. How much did his battle with depression affect his fitness to fly? Should he have walked away from his job? Should his doctors have sounded alarm bells? His case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma. Too often and for too long, people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen. When we don't distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one, we reinforce a pernicious idea that's both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness. Some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help. That's why in our public and more private discourse, people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that doesn't drive some into the darkness. We need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing. And we have to recognize that \"mental illness\" is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways. People with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment, many can recover and live healthy, productive lives. We must encourage them to open up, and when they do, we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously. It wasn't that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly-kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members, friends and especially employers. But that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer, their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease. Similarly, and with the courageous example of Michael J. Fox, we've seen perceptions about Parkinson's disease change for the better, as people learn more about what it is and isn't. Time to talk about depression . That's the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better-informed public discussion. We have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear. That includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place (through laws and regulations like the Americans for Disabilities Act) for individuals who disclose their disability. We also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk. It's a difficult balance. Sooner rather than later, policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people. At the same time, we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities, families and employers. That can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions. If companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society, we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground. We won't pretend that this is an easy problem to solve. But, awful as Germanwings Flight 9525 tragedy was, the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue. We need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness.",

Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. However, Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Harry Kane calmly slots Tottenham's third goal in time added on after coming one-on-one with Krul . Kane celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as Spurs claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle . He said: 'He has big potential. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'It's a fantastic achievement and I congratulate him. He deserves this moment because he has worked a lot. It's an historic thing. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' If it was Kane who put the icing on the cake at St James' Park, it was Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat. Chadli fired them in front on the half-hour and after Jack Colback had levelled 20 seconds after the restart, Eriksen scored with a free-kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper Tim Krul. Kane killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st-minute break to leave Pochettino delighted. Tottenham striker Kane at full stretch as he is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . Kane celebrates his goal against Newcastle as opposition goalkeeper Tim Krul looks on in despair . He said: 'We fully deserved the victory and the three points. I think our performance was better than Newcastle's and I am very pleased for our players. 'I am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that wasn't good and it's important to feel victory again.' It proved a difficult day for opposite number John Carver, whose side had to contend not only with Tottenham, but a boycott by some of their own fans. Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Vernon Anita . Carver insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000-capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the Magpies, who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone, are engaged in a survival fight. He said: 'Absolutely, we're in amongst it, there's no danger of that, because you have got sides - and I'll use Leicester as an example - who are winning games. We aren't. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise . Newcastle players join Colback as the hard-working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area . 'But we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board. We have to come up with a solution, I have to come up with a solution. 'I have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye, but I need to find a way of getting some results, getting some points. People might not like what they see, but I'm going to have to do it.' Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at home . Fans applaud Newcastle's goals while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, Not Ashley' sign during the game . Geordie Carver was installed as Alan Pardew's replacement until the end of the season in January, and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since, although he is refusing to throw in the towel. He said: 'It's probably the most difficult situation I have ever been in. But I'm a fighter and I'm not going to shirk anything. I'll take the stick and I'll take the responsibility because that's the type of person I am. 'But I'm not going to give up on it. Yes, I'm angry and I'm annoyed, and I've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private. But I have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it.' A plane hired by the supporters of rivals Sunderland heap misery on Newcastle United . 'We don't demand a team that wins, we demand a team that tries,' reads banner outside St James' Park .",

West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost. Sam Allardyce is not the man to lead West Ham into their new exciting adventure at the\u00a0Olympic Stadium . Allardyce (left, pictured behind Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini) has not been up to scratch . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's brilliant column on Jack Grealish . The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom. If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game \u2014 31 points from 17 matches \u2014 they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season \u2014 12 points from 16 games \u2014 they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival. Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project .",

Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nKent Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.",

A Houston Uber driver arrested and charged last week with sexually assaulting a female passenger was granted approval to drive for the car service despite being a convicted cocaine dealer. Duncan Burton, 57, was released in November 2012 after 14-years behind bars but was allowed to work for Uber despite city controls prohibiting drug felons driving cabs. Burton was taken into custody on Wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years. Uber spokeswoman, Debbee Hancock said on Monday that Burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name. However, according to Uber's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago. That means because Burton was sentence 14-years ago, his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag. Indeed, Burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the US Bureau of Prisons. That information is readily available online by typing in his name. He was convicted in Houston and served time in Louisana and Georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior. According to Houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs. However, they could appeal and still receive one. Burton did not have a city permit to drive a cab and had never applied for an exemption. Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. Last week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks.",

Yesterday, Allie, 21, based in Minneapolis, delivered her beau the ten-question document, which she dubbed 'The Official Allie Davis Relationship Test', and informed him that he must score at least 60 per cent 'to stay in the relationship'. She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter, revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent, for diligently answering questions mainly about Beyonce's songs. Prove it: Allie Davis, 21, (pictured) is so obsessed with Beyonce that yesterday she made her boyfriend take a written exam on the famous singer in order to stay with her . Passed: She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter (pictured), revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent . After a series of questions about Beyonce's songs, and those of other artists, Allie demands: 'Briefly explain the Solange Knowles elevator incident. Who was involved?' Allie's very obedient boyfriend scrawled in response: 'A billion dollars, and Jay Z got punched.' This question referred to last year's legendary family fracas at New York's Met Gala, when Beyonce's sister Solange Knowles viciously attacked Beyonce's husband Jay Z following a heated row. Beyonce, 33, later mysteriously sang in her Flawless remix with fellow songstress Nicki Minaj: 'Of course sometimes s**t goes down when there\u2019s a billion dollars on an elevator.' After a series of questions about Beyonce's songs, and those of other artists, Allie demands, 'Briefly explain the Solange Knowles elevator incident. Who was involved?' Allie also dropped in a few questions about some of her other famous popstars, One Direction included . Allie's Twitter bio reads 'I met Beyonce [left] at Top Shop and life will never be the same', and the young blonde also appears to be quite the fan of One Direction's Harry Styles (right) Allie - whose Twitter bio reads 'I met Beyonce at Top Shop and life will never be the same' - also dropped in a few questions about some of her other famous popstars, One Direction included. Asked to list the first names of three members of the British boy band, Allie's boyfriend incorrectly answered with 'Harry' and 'Zack' - to which Allie wrote on the sheet of paper: 'WTF No.' He did manage to get the last question on the exam right, however, by correctly identifying that 'no', Harry Styles should not cut his hair. Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves, 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship.' Sharing is caring: Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves (pictured), 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship' At least one commentator took the stunt very seriously, writing on Buzzfeed: 'Dump her ass... this is a HUGE warning sign. [Don't] put up with this kind of deluded psycho act.' Allie then explained in her defence: 'It literally took five minutes to write and I did it because I was bored and I like to mess with my boyfriend.' She later added: 'When some people call you nuts and psychotic because of a funny Beyonce joke #lightenup'.",

CHELSEA 2004-05... Paulo Ferreira, John Terry, William Gallas, Ricardo Carvalho . No team in Premier League history has conceded fewer goals than Mourinho\u2019s side in his first season in England after the Portuguese coach moved to Stamford Bridge fresh from his Champions League triumph with Porto. Chelsea\u2019s defence was breached just 15 times as they won the title with 95 points, another Premier League record. Mourinho brought Ferreira and Carvalho with him from Porto and the effect was instant. William Gallas and John Terry celebrate after the latter scored for Chelsea in a 4-1 win against West Ham . MANCHESTER UNITED 1998-99... Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Ronny Johnsen, Denis Irwin . United\u2019s Treble winners were not the meanest by any stretch, letting in 37 goals in 1999 compared with the 17 conceded by nearest challengers Arsenal. But the attacking instincts of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s side always meant it was going to be a case of \u2018we\u2019ll score more goals than you\u2019, as was evident in the two 3-3 draws with Barcelona that season. Ferguson has since said that Irwin would be the only certain inclusion in a best XI picked from his time at Old Trafford, while selling Stam was arguably his biggest regret. Either way, this back four deserves their place in the hall of fame on the basis of the club\u2019s Treble achievement. Jaap Staam (centre) and Gary Neville (right), pictured with David Beckham and Dwight Yorke (top), formed half of United's Treble-winning defence. Denis Irwin played at left back with Ronny Johnsen partnering Stam . MANCHESTER UNITED 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09: Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra . This was an altogether more compact United, conceding an average of 24 goals on their way to winning the title three years in a row. Has there ever been a better bit of January transfer business than the two deals United completed in 2006 to sign Vidic and Evra from Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively?\u00a0Vidic teamed up with the majestic Ferdinand to forge one of the great central defensive partnerships, playing together in three Champions League finals, while Neville was still going strong at right back. Nani's celebration is overlooked by Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand in the summer of 2007 . Ferdinand's partnership with Vidic helped Manchester United to successive titles in 2007, 2008 and 2009 . MANCHESTER CITY 20011-12: Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Joleon Lescott, Aleksandar Kolarov . Manchester City\u2019s success in conceding only 29 goals was ultimately crucial in snatching the title away from United on goal difference after an unforgettable final day of the season in 2012. Kompany, who lifted the trophy, was well on his way to establishing himself as a City legend, as was Zabaleta. Both players had been signed by Mark Hughes, along with Lescott, but the defensive nous of Italian Roberto Mancini helped turn City into a more solid unit before he brought in the combative Kolarov from Lazio. Vincent Kompany is mobbed by his defensive partner\u00a0Aleksandar Kolarov after scoring against Liverpool .",

Inside the Juventus Stadium, with 2,000 travelling England fans seated in the curva at the north west area, there was more of the same. England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's friendly draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . Michael Carrick (centre) and the rest of the England squad applaud the travelling support in Turin on Tuesday . Frankly, it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good-natured and good-humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to June\u2019s friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. It also places a strain on the FA. What can they do when thousands of travelling fans are singing: \u2018Where were you in World War Two,\u2019 or the German bomber song that has been heard for many years on our overseas trips? Toe-curling stuff. As for the IRA songs, many of the younger fans who join in with these chants cannot know or understand the significance of the Irish political situation and how it affected Britain through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties. In Dublin there will be the issue of provocation, the potential to engage with a city that has traditionally been a political hotspot.There is barely time to catch our breath before England\u2019s 3,000 supporters head to the Aviva Stadium for the first fixture against the Republic of Ireland since 1995. It was at Lansdowne Road on February 15 that year when rioting England fans - many of them associated with the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 - caused the fixture with Jack Charlton\u2019s side to be abandoned. England supporters throw missiles at Landsdowne Road 20 years ago, causing the fixture to be abandoned . In the intervening years there have been various conversations between the FA and the FA of Ireland about a fixture between the teams, but it is only now they can agree that the time is right. Let\u2019s not spoil it. The fixture with Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s labouring team on June 7 is a bookend to the season ahead of the final chapter in Slovenia seven days later. Roy Hodgson is a football man and you can tell by his pained expression at the end of every post-match briefing that he would rather not be answering questions about fans\u2019 behaviour. \u2018We can only hope that in some way we put that right before we go to Ireland because the last thing we want is anything (other) than a very good football match,\u2019 he said after the 1-1 draw with Italy. This is an awkward situation for the FA and yesterday they were reluctant to release another statement condemning the anti-IRA chanting as there is no evidence that it has had a positive effect. It seems by Roy Hodgson's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the England boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans' behaviour . The first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to Celtic Park in November, when England emerged with an uplifting 3-1 victory over Scotland. Life felt good. That was until Hodgson, underprepared for a question about the nature of the chants, answered one with some assistance from a diplomatic member of the FA\u2019s communications team. The FA attempted to defuse the situation by releasing a statement the following day apologising for the behaviour of \u2018a section of the England support\u2019. It read: \u2018We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective.\u2019 The songs were sung in England's win against Scotland and the FA wanted to make sure they stopped in Turin\u00a0- there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . The FA are in a tricky position because they are getting hammered by the travelling fans at every away game for the \u2018two caps for Wembley\u2019 loyalty scheme. Previously, those who travelled to watch England were rewarded with double the \u2018caps\u2019, giving greater access to restricted-allocation European Championship and World Cup tickets. Now, fans who attend home games get twice the points instead. The FA would do well to take a closer look at this policy in an effort to placate the supporters. Is it a fair trade? Probably not, but then it isn\u2019t equitable to inflict anti-IRA songs on the people of Ireland the day before kick-off at the Aviva Stadium, either.",

The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin. 'He got up and resumed teaching after the demo was over. Looked uncomfortable, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do,' Mubarak said.",

Activists in the Missouri suburb, protesting over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop, were also known as 'adversaries', according to internal briefings seen by CNN\u00a0this week. The National Guard was first activated in Ferguson in August after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency when riots and looting broke out amid peaceful demonstrations over police brutality. National Guard soldiers secure the police command center in Ferguson, Missouri, on November 27 last year. An internal report has revealed that the heavily-militarized guard referred to  protesters as 'enemy forces' The guard were activated again in November ahead of the November 24 decision by a St Louis grand jury who decided not to indict the officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. Many in the community accused the National Guard of making an already tense situation worse. Guardsmen were seen rolling through the streets of the suburb in tanks wearing combat gear and carrying assault rifles. Missouri National Guard described some  on the streets as 'enemy forces' including the KKK, the RgB Black Rebels and the New Black Panther Party - \u00a0but also the 'general protesters'. According to CNN, National Guard supervisors were worried about how they were being viewed by the public and asked guardsmen to tone down the heavily militarized language. Officers were told by superiors to change references to 'enemy' to 'criminal elements' instead. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a response from the Missouri National Guard on Friday. Brown's shooting stirred long-simmering racial tensions in the St. Louis suburb, where two-thirds of the residents are black but the police force is almost entirely white. Rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily-armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions. At times, protesters lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, who fired tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds. At the time of the Guard's deployment in November,\u00a0St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said he supported Nixon's decision to activate the Guard. 'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting directly with demonstrators,' Slay said. Protesters flip over a Ferguson police car on November 25, 2014. Missouri's governor ordered hundreds more National Guard troops to the St Louis suburb following the grand jury's decision not to indict white cop Darren Wilson over the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown .",

Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury . It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries . Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time. Leeds were not available for comment.",

Pictures show the aerial view of the new buildings which have been built following the discovery of the 12-year-old's body in the in 2013. The two-bedroomed terraced house - Number 20 The Lindens in New Addington, near Croydon south London - was bulldozed in June 2013 along with the two neighbouring properties. 19a and 19b\u00a0The Lindens in New Addington, near Croydon - the previous address, where\u00a0Tia Sharp was sexually assaulted and then brutally murdered has been completely wiped off the map . 20 The Lindens as it was before: Neighbours say the old house was a constant reminder of the evil that happened there . In its place, two new houses have been built, which will be numbered 19a and 19b, completely wiping number 20 from the map. The two identical houses come with a garden, shed and new solar panels on the roof. The properties are clearly noticeable next to the old houses in the street. One local resident who did not want to be named said: 'We are so relieved that it has gone. It was a constant reminder of the evil that took place there. 'It has been raised to the ground and erased from our memories. 'The new homes are lovely.' The former home was where evil killer Stuart Hazell, 39, murdered the schoolgirl and dumped her body in the loft. Twelve-year-old Tia Sharp (left) was sexually assaulted and then brutally murdered by Hazell (right) before her body was hidden in the loft . He was living there with his partner, 49-year-old Christine Bicknell, Tia's grandmother. Twisted Hazell was one of the 'heartbroken' family members who 'searched' for Tia during a national manhunt in August 2012 after she disappeared. As the distraught and desperate family members comforted each other in the house, they were unaware that missing Tia was just feet away from them, wrapped in bin-liners in the loft. Father-of-one Hazell suffocated Tia during a sex attack after months of trawling vile internet pornography sites and filming her as she slept. Hazell was living there with his partner, 49-year-old Christine Bicknell, (pictured) Tia's grandmother . Her body was not found for over a week by police - even though it just feet away from where they had been searching. The property, which is owned by Croydon Council, was demolished to avoid it becoming a sick tourist attraction. Two adjoining houses were also demolished by the council and now building work has been going to replace the three bulldozed properties with two new ones. A Croydon Council spokesman confirmed the homes are near completion and the number 20 will not be used. Hazell, who lied that Tia spent the night at home before heading to a shopping centre in nearby Croydon, was jailed for life in May last year. He pleaded not guilty before changing his plea to guilty on the fifth day of his trial at the Old Bailey. A Croydon Council spokesman confirmed the homes are near completion and the number 20 will not be used .",

The broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of Mr Engel, which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed, was carried out by forces associated with President Bashar-al Assad. But Mr Engel has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a Sunni group who had tried to convince their victims that they were Shi-ite rebels affiliated to the Government. Scroll down for video . NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel (centre) was taken captive with Turkey reporter Aziz Akyavas (left) and photographer John Kooistra (right) and were convinced by their captors they had been taken by forces related to President Bashar al-Assad, but they may have been Sunni rebels instead . A statement posted on the NBC News site said: 'The group that kidnapped us put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite Shabiha militiamen.\u00a0The group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances.' The statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight, as they were told, this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes. Instead the captives may just have been handed over. The statement added: 'We have not been able to get a definitive account of what happened that night. But based on all of our reporting, it is clear that we were kidnapped by a criminal gang for money and released for propaganda purposes. 'This, of course, does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous. It does, however, underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside Syria.' Mr Engel and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the New York Times raised questions over the attackers' identities. They suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a Sunni criminal element of the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army and known for taking hostages. The New York Times claimed that NBC executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers' identities during and after Mr Engel was taken. Mr Engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces . But immediately after his release Mr Engel appeared on Today and in a Vanity Fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group, government militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. He made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors, which included that they had been rescued by Sunni rebels. The paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the Assad regime. Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra, were taken hostage on December 13, 2012, while reporting in Syria. The foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a Syrian rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see Iranian and Lebanese prisoners being held by rebels. Syrians run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the Bustan Al-Qasr district of Aleppo . They were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound, blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes. The kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress GPS signal, which informed NBC exactly where they were. \u00a0NBC was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world, also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location. Engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall behind them. It read: \u2018Or will burn.\u2019 A statement published by NBC said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes . During the five days they were held Mr Engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot, and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last. He claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers.\u00a0As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. On the fifth night they were loaded, while blindfolded, into a van. They were told they would be handed over to military forces in  Foua. As they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor. Engel has since said, in light of the new information, this may have been staged to convince them they were rescued rather than handed over. Engel, who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's chief foreign correspondent in 2008.",

Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c) Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.",

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), before having to come back in, which he said was 'the saddest moment of my life'. But the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when White was back inside. It's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside. Had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves, they wouldn't have been able to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and would have been lost in space. And had that worse case scenario happened, it could easily have scuppered the Apollo missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969. Edward White, pictured, became the first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 June 1965. He spent 20 minutes in space, and said coming back in was 'the saddest moment of my life'. As it was the first spacewalk, there were a number of complications. White used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space . The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White.\u00a0They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. Shown is the first page of the checklist (left) and the Suit Integrity Check (right) for the spacecraft . The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. On the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft, and on the right, part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . Checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts. The spacewalk checklist for the Gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to McDivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago. The document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission. Cassandra Hatton, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the item, said: 'The Gemini 4 mission was the first time [an American] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme. Gemini 4 (pictured) launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board . Shown are astronauts Edward H. White II (left) and James A. McDivitt, command pilot for Gemini 4 . 'We knew we could get into space but until this point we didn't know if we could walk and float around out there. Jim McDivitt and Ed White's achievement is second only to landing on the moon. 'The checklist was vital for making sure things didn't go wrong and they didn't get sucked out into space. 'They had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck. There was a problem with the latch on the hatch. It was a really scary, life or death moment. 'If they hadn't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space. It would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme.' The auction takes place on April 24 in New York. The Gemini spacecraft (illustrated) was fairly cramped, leaving the astronauts little room to move around . This fantastic shot shows White floating above the curvature of Earth with the hatch seen open on the right .",

The actress is selling the Manhattan penthouse she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis with an asking price of $75million which is exactly half of her total estimated fortune of $150million. And if the penthouse sells for that much, it will break the record for the most expensive co-op apartment ever sold on the Upper West Side. Moore and Willis purchased the south tower penthouse on the 28th floor of the historic San Remo apartment building in 1990 from Saturday Night Fever producer Robert Stigwood, in addition to a two-bedroom maisonette on the lobby floor. Scroll down for video . Moving out: Demi Moore is selling the Manhattan penthouse apartment she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis for a $75million asking price . 'We looked at everything on the park, Fifth Avenue, Central Park South and Central Park West, and there was just nothing like it,' Moore told the New York Times of her house search. 'The location, architecture and history of the San Remo were on a completely different level.' The 14-bedroom apartment includes a 7,000 square feet of living space and wrap around terraces with views of both Central Park and the Hudson River. The couple decorated the mansion in the skies in a Southwestern mission motif, complete with cherry wood detailing and a ceramic tile fireplace. New windows have been installed in every room, the bathrooms remolded and state-of-the-art equipment like a sub-zero refrigerator and viking range installed in the kitchen. Split: The couple, pictured left in 1997, purchased the Upper West Side home in 1990. They split up in 2000, and Moore says she doesn't spend much time there anymore. Pictured on the right leaving the residence in 2005 .

The two towers of the San Remo building seen behind the Central Park Lake . The 24 by 17 foot dining room features a crystal chandelier. In the living room, the focal point are the windows which look out onto the boat pond in Central Park. The San Remo was designed in 1929 by American architect Emery Roth, and it was turned into a co-op in 1972. Over the years, Moore has counted Dustin Hoffman, Diane Keaton, Steven Spielberg as neighbors - not to mention U2 frontman Bono who occupies the north tower penthouse. Moore says she is selling the apartment and maisonette since she doesn't spend much time at the residence anymore. Adam D Modlin, president of the Modlin Group, is in charge of the listing and says there is no other apartment in the neighborhood to rival Moore's. 'Compared with the other iconic private perches on the perimeter of Central Park, there just isn\u2019t anything quite like this penthouse,' he said. 'It is the grandest residence in the south tower, the one that sits above all the others, a mansion in the clouds, and it is the largest intact park-facing residence at the San Remo with private outdoor space.' Moore and Willis were married from 1987 until 2000 and share three daughters. The combined monthly maintenance fees for both residences is more than $20,000.",

The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC.\u00a0Other names have not been released. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com . Drug ring? Many of those facing death row were trying to import or export the drug 'ice' into or out of Guangzhou. Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline. A spokesman for Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said Australia should lead efforts against the death penalty, 'in particular working with the United Nations'.

The Millers fielded Derby defender Farrend Rawson in their 1-0 win against Brighton on Easter Monday after his youth loan had expired. The Football League maintain the paperwork for his extension wasn\u2019t handled properly. They have until May 1 to appeal the decision and, should they choose to, that could have ramifications with an ultimate decision likely to be taken after the season has finished. Rotherham manager Steve Evans has seen his side deducted three points by the Football League . On-loan Derby defender Farrend Rawson (third right) played in the 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday . Rawson (right, pictured playing for Derby's Under 21 side) wore the Rotherham shirt four times . Rotherham were on 44 points (left) but are now just one point above the relegation zone after the deduction . A Football League statement read: 'Rotherham were also fined the sum of \u00a330,000, half of which will be suspended until the end of the 2015-16 season. The club must also pay the costs of the hearing and the Football League.' The Football League set a precedent for penalties this time last year after slapping AFC Wimbledon with a three-point deduction and \u00a35,000 fine after playing Jake Nicholson when he wasn\u2019t registered correctly. Blackpool were fined \u00a330,000 earlier this season after starting on-loan Donervon Daniels once his 28-day youth loan had expired but escaped the loss of points because they lost at Millwall on August 30. Top QC Jim Sturman unsuccessfully defended Rotherham, who will feel the full force of financial relegations should they are to drop into League One. The punishment means they are now only one point ahead of the Championship relegation zone with two games left. Rotherham drew 1-1 with Fulham last Wednesday, which left them four points above the relegation zone . Rotherham\u2019s scenario has set-up a tantalising end to the campaign, bringing two teams who appeared doomed back into play. Wigan lie on 39 points, Millwall 40 and Rotherham 41 before this Saturday\u2019s fixtures. Steve Evans\u2019 side have a tough trip to Norwich, while Millwall host Derby and Wigan play Wolves at the DW Stadium. All three opponents still have things to play for in the final two weeks of the season.

Carl Forster's try and Griffin's penalty made the game safe, though, despite the prolific Aaron Murphy's try setting up a tense finish. Salford Red Devils secured a second win in a row with a 18-12 victory at Huddersfield . Salford made a fast start and Cory Paterson had a try ruled out on 18 minutes. A Rangi Chase kick-through was fumbled by a Giants player in the in-goal area and Paterson pounced but referee James Child had already ruled it a knock-on and given the Red Devils a drop out. The game was twice delayed early on when Kevin Locke for Salford and Huddersfield's Brett Ferres were carried off injured. Griffin opened the scoring on 21 minutes when he pounced on a mistake by Huddersfield's Jermaine McGillvary. The winger seemed set to grab a grubber kick into the left corner by Jones-Bishop - but when he slipped in the in-goal area Griffin was there to score. He failed to convert but was on target 10 minutes later after Jones-Bishop took advantage of more slack defending. Rangi Chase kicked through straight from a scrum and Jones-Bishop got to the ball first despite several Giants players being better placed. Lacklustre Huddersfield, seeking a fifth straight win, woke up after that and were back in the contest on 38 minutes. On-loan Wigan forward Hughes went over from Jamie Ellis' pass after good work by Eorl Crabtree. There was a flare-up on half-time when Crabtree and Weller Hauraki came to blows after the Kiwi made a heavy tackle on the England international. Salford extended their 10-6 half-time lead on 55 minutes when Forster grabbed his first try of the season. Griffin, the older brother of fellow former Huddersfield player Darrell, who was on the bench for this match, converted. Hauraki was put on report on 62 minutes for a bad tackle which left Giants full-back Scott Grix needing treatment. Murphy then went over in the right corner on 76 minutes for his fourth try in as many games. Brough added the extras to leave the home side a converted try away from a late victory. But soon after they were punished for interfering with play and Griffin kicked the resulting penalty. Solid defending, including forcing Huddersfield to play out a set of six around their own 10-metre line, helped Salford see the game out.",

On Saturday the spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles (14km) of the surface to take a closer look at the jets that are being ejected from its surface. But during the manoeuvre, Rosetta lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into \u2018safe mode\u2019, causing it to momentarily lose contact with Earth. The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft (illustrated) has survived a hair-raising encounter with comet 67P after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby. Rosetta launched into space in 2004 and entered orbit around 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014 . \u2018Not the best month to choose to go dry\u2026\u2019 Rosetta project scientist Dr Matt Taylor quipped on Twitter, as the team back on Earth sweated over the safety of the spacecraft. The problems arose due to Rosetta\u2019s limited vision owing to the amount of material it was flying through. The spacecraft uses two star trackers to work out where it is in space, in addition to a sun sensor, navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes. Crucially, the star trackers allow Rosetta to know where it is with respect to the sun and Earth, so it can correctly orient its antenna to send and receive signals from ground stations on our planet. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing to orbit and study the comet. From data collected by the two proves, Esa said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. When the star trackers are not working properly, the antenna  drifts, causing communications to be temporarily lost. And during the recent flyby, the spacecraft started to mistake comet debris for stars, causing it to lose sight of Earth. The spacecraft autonomously attempted to readjust itself but struggled due to its close proximity to comet 67P. Esa said that \u2018hundreds of \u201cfalse stars\u201d were registered\u2019 and it took nearly 24 hours before the spacecraft could properly start tracking again. During this dramatic event, the antenna had become mis-aligned with Earth, so that only a very weak radio signal was being received. Once the tracking system was restored, the off-pointing was immediately correct and the operations team on the ground saw a return to full signal strength. Some issues with \u2018false stars\u2019 were still occurring, though, and attempts to eradicate them caused the same problem to occur. This time, the spacecraft but itself into \u2018safe mode\u2019 to preserve its safety, during which it switched off its science instruments to replace them. Esa said it took until Monday to get the spacecraft back into \u2018normal\u2019 status. On whether the problem could cause Rosetta to lose permanent contact with Earth if it happened again, Dr Taylor told MailOnline that they were 'looking at ways to minimise this from happening.' \u2018Plans for the future are being discussed now,\u2019 he added. He also said they had been \u2018flying at a very low relative velocity to the comet to reduce the chance\u2019 of any lasting damage being caused by debris. The spacecraft is now performing a wide sweep around the comet, giving engineers ample time to make sure the problem does not occur again. 'We are looking to examine the best way to mitigate the chance of re-occurrence,' said Dr Taylor. The spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles (400km) of the comet to within 90 miles (140km) by Wednesday next week. The spacecraft uses two star trackers (shown in red) to work out where it is in space, in addition to a sun sensor, navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes. The star trackers allow Rosetta to know where it is with respect to Earth, so it can send and receive signals. The high gain antenna is in the background . Rosetta was tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface (shown in image). It is hoped that continuing studies like this could reveal what the comet's interior is composed of - but engineers will be hoping that this 'false stars' anomaly does not occur again . This diagram shows an example of Rosetta's recent flyby trajectories at Comet 67P.\u00a0The spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles (400km) of the comet to within 90 miles (140km) by Wednesday next week . The purpose of flying in so close is to examine 67P's geysers. These jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. It is getting closer and closer over the next few months, with its point of closest approach taking place in August. As it becomes more active, Rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data. Studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface, and it could also reveal the connection between the comet\u2019s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface. Despite the drama, Esa was still able to release some amazing images recently taken by Rosetta. This stunning scene was created from two Rosetta frames acquired at 12 miles (19.9 km) from the comet centre on 28 March. The scale is about 1.7 m/pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km . The latest images include ones of Earth and Mars which were taken when the probe was attempting \u2018gravity assist manoeuvres\u2019 in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet. Pictured is Mars as seen by Rosetta in 2007 . As the comet gets closer to the sun, scientists will also be hoping to hear from the Philae lander on the surface. The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. Now, as the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae\u2019s batteries and bring it back to life. As the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae\u2019s batteries and bring it back to life. Shown is one of the first images returned by Philae on the surface, showing what appears to be the probe on its side wedged in darkness against a cliff .",

Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher is confident part of that will come their way. 'My understanding is that Suge is going to be bailed out this coming week,' Fletcher told the New York Daily News outside court. 'We think Mr. Mayweather is going to win the championship and then come champion the day again,' he said. 'They're good friends, and there's no reason he shouldn't. And we believe that will happen.'

Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said  Twiglet was left behaving strangely after swallowing the unidentified substance while on a walk near their home last Monday. The four-year-old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop. Vet Nick Fisher, 31, from Leintwardine, Shropshire, said his bedlington lurcher Twiglet (pictured) was left behaving strangely after eating the drugs he found at a bus stop while on a walk near their home last Monday . Twiglet seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drug . But after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls Twiglet seemed back to normal following his 'trip'. Today Mr Fisher, a veterinary surgeon, said: 'We had been taking Twiglet out for a walk as we normally do. 'We went past the bus stop which is just like a seat around an oak tree. 'A few people often hang out there and drop things like food and so on, so the dogs like to go scavenging around that area. 'He came back in the house and lay down and was tired as you might expect. 'But then he got up and started running around, doing laps of the room as if he was being chased. The bus stop in\u00a0Leintwardine, Shorpshire, where Twiglet found and consumed the unidentified narcotics . After  drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls he seems to be back to normal . 'He had his tail between his legs and his head down, which he only does when he is being chased around by our other dogs. 'When I got hold of him he started shaking uncontrollably, producing huge quantities of saliva and panting excessively. 'He then lost his balance on the laminate flooring and fell onto his side. 'My wife was obviously quite upset. She's never seen a dog go through anything neurological before. Let alone tripping on drugs. 'I just reacted instinctively and had to treat him like any client's dog. I took step back and tried to remain calm.' Because of Twiglet's symptoms Mr Fisher believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic . The father-of-one said he phoned the nurse at his surgery in Ludlow, Shropshire, to come and take a blood sample and made Twiglet vomit. The blood test did not show any obvious medical cause but a veterinary neurologist believed the illness to have been caused by narcotics. He added: 'The next day he was completely back to normal - although his eyes were very red. 'I've got a friend who is a neurologist so I asked them what they thought it was. 'Because of the circumstances and symptoms they suggested it sounded like he'd ingested something hallucinogenic. 'For a dog with no history of having any neurological issues to behave like this for a short period is usually related to drugs. Twiglet's scavenging days would appear to be over following the unfortunate incident last week . 'He would have been quite an unlucky dog to have had all those symptoms and for it to be anything else. 'It's not a common diagnosis around our village but there is a bit of a hippie commune up the road. Maybe something was dropped or had fallen out of someone's pocket. 'I have only seen one similar case in which we found a dog had swallowed a bag of marijuana - we just want other owners to be careful in future.' Wife Karen, 33, a farm consultant, added: 'It led to a 45 minute episode in which Twiglet showed symptoms of being under the influence of narcotics. 'Symptoms include hallucinating, partial seizures, tremors, hyper salivating, in-coordination and collapsing. 'We want to make other owners aware to be vigilant when walking their dogs in the area.' The vet is urging dog owners to be vigilant while walking pets in the area in case a similar incident occurs .",

Swafford had an 11-under 133 total at TPC Louisiana. Weekley, the first-round leader after a 64, also was 11 under with three holes left. Jason Day, ranked sixth in the world, was 5 under for the round through 14 holes, pulling him into a five-way tie for third at 10 under with Brandon de Jonge, Cameron Tringale, former Zurich champion Jerry Kelly and Daniel Berger. Tringale had a 65, and de Jonge shot 70. Kelley was on the 18th green when play was stopped, and Berger had three holes left. Hudson Swafford watches his tee shot on the 18th hole on day two at the Zurich Classic . Boo Weekley tees off on the 5th hole at TPC Louisiana in Avondale on Friday . Second-round play was scheduled to resume Saturday at 8 a.m. CDT. The field remained tightly packed with birdies seemingly harder to come by Friday. Many players cited a combination of wind, soggy turf from recent rain and thick, swampy air as reasons for the course to play even longer than usual. Six players were tied for eighth, two shots off the lead. They were Chad Campbell, Morgan Hoffman, Steven Bowditch, Justin Thomas, Chris Stroud and David Hearn. Seven more players were at 8 under, including Marc Leishman, who returned to the PGA Tour this weekend after taking a month off from golf to tend to family when his wife became gravely ill. With his wife, recovering, Leishman came to New Orleans saying he just wanted to knock off some rust and was keeping expectations low. He did a lot better than that and is now in line for a nice pay-day, given officials were estimating the cut line at four under. Swafford chips on to the 17th green before ending the day tied for the lead on 11-under . Marc Leishman (right) takes a drop after hitting into the water on the 18th hole . Leishman was at 10 under through 17 holes, putting him in position to set a TPC Louisiana record with a birdie on the par-5 18th. But after a booming drive, Leishman gambled on an aggressive second shot, using his driver on the fairway. He pushed his ball right into the water. When play was stopped, he was on the fringe, lying four, needing to sink his next shot Saturday morning to tie the course record of 62. Swafford, in only his second season on the tour, had six birdies and no bogeys during his second round, putting him in position to contend for what would be his maiden PGA Tour victory. His best finish so far is tied for eighth at the Frys.com Open last October, though his most impressive outing may have been at last month's Arnold Palmer invitational at Bay Hill, where he tied for 11th. Weekley, meanwhile, continued to play well with new shafts that he credited for a strong first round after missing the cut in three of his previous four tournaments. England's Justin Rose is just four shots off the lead on 7-under, while Rickie Fowler is one shot off the projected cut as he finished the day on 3-under after his round was stopped at the 15th.

Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was looking to improve on the Internet-connected device, which was trumpeted as a huge technological leap forward when it was announced in 2012. However, Google stopped selling the first version and shut its pre-launch Explorer program for Google Glass earlier this year, prompting speculation about the demise of the wearable gadget before it became widely available. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There\u2019s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we\u2019re ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets. 'There are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3' of Google Glass, Vian said, according to NDTV. Details about what the new versions will look like have not yet been released. Processor company Intel is expected to create the chip in the device.",

I\u2019m a size 10, but even so I could do with dropping 10lbs. But as long as I don\u2019t mind, who cares? Which is why I\u2019m utterly peeved about Dove's latest campaign results.\u00a0How humiliating to film women in a public place \u2018choosing\u2019 to walk through a door marked either \u2018beautiful\u2019 or \u2018average\u2019. Talk about putting the meeker sex on the spot. It's hardly a big surprise the survey discovered 96 per cent of women chose the 'average' option. From my experience, most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than  freely admit that not only are they good-looking, but they\u2019re also (whisper it) beautiful. Why is this? Numerous university studies have been carried out (I know this because their authors send them to me) and they have all come up with the same conclusion \u2013 it\u2019s self-protection. If women don\u2019t fit in with their (usually older, fatter, less attractive) female peers, then those who are good-looking won\u2019t get hired for jobs by the fairer sex; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they\u2019ll routinely receive their P45 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile. And this is what really exasperates me: it isn\u2019t society that won\u2019t let us admit that we\u2019re beautiful \u2013 it\u2019s the very same members of our own sex who hold us back. Even though I\u2019m an un-Botoxed, un-surgically enhanced 44-year-old, I would have marched through the entrance marked beautiful without giving it a second thought. I\u2019m extremely comfortable in my skin. Haters: Samantha has received death threats for standing up and saying 'I'm beautiful' This confidence annoys the heck out of other women. You might have read what I\u2019ve written about this problem, in an\u00a0article published in April 2012. It received almost 5,000 comments online and suddenly I was a global name. The earth turned on its axis as one woman - me - was up for admitting: \u2018I like how I look and other women have a problem with it.\u2019 Since then I\u2019ve been ridiculed, received death threats, told I\u2019m off my rocker. Just last week I received yet another email from a woman titled \u2018please read me\u2019 which went on at length to tell me I was \u2018an arrogant, cocky woman\u2019. Little wonder only four per cent of women were brave enough to walk through a door marked 'beautiful' in the Dove campaign. Critical: Samantha claims Dove's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly . My personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple: we\u2019d rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow 'fairer' sex any more ammunition than we've got already against each other. My view is supported by the thousands of emails I\u2019ve received over the years from women routinely humiliated, bullied and singled out by their female peers for daring to think they look good. The emails depressingly cover the same ground wherever they live in the world. Whether they\u2019re teenagers at school in the US, middle-aged mums in Australia or women in the workplace in the UK: if they rate themselves, display confidence, or dare to say they look good they get bullied or socially ostracised. A recent plea from a young women in how to deal with her critics was this: . \u2018I have just looked up your article, it\u2019s my life in black and white. I tried dressing down, not wearing too much make up, unfashionable clothes and flat shoes. Reaching out: Samantha receives letters from teens who get bullied for being beautiful . 'I am confident and friendly, men open doors for me, they are polite. But some women are awful to me as a result of it. 'I am fed up with it, angry about it, annoyed with it. I feel like a complete nothing and nobody; maybe that\u2019s what I should be to be accepted.\u2019 Another woman was banned by her mean-minded (older) female boss for wearing heels to work: they were a \u2018health hazard\u2019. What health and safety offense could she cause wearing stilettos while working as a receptionist? The mind boggles. How awful that these women are treated this way. It's little wonder so many of the fairer sex refuse to acknowledge that they are good-looking, which is ironic because so many do it in private \u2013 behind the anonymity of social media. We know how to photograph ourselves well thanks to selfies and social media sites such as Instagram. We can iron out wrinkles, banish zits, magically award ourselves a thigh gap or hip dip. In the Dove campaign, women were asked to choose between a door marked 'beautiful' or 'average' Yet to admit to the world \u2018yeah, I look good\u2019 means we risk incurring the wrath of other women. We have to be display modesty at all times - which is why Dove's campaign works brilliantly. I\u2019m not some superior Type A female who doesn\u2019t recognise that there are some who don\u2019t feel happy about themselves. Yet such feelings of low self-esteem seem to go hand in hand with the desire to criticise and target others in order to restore an illusion of self worth. Any female trolls ousted usually blame their behaviour on a crisis of confidence. Ironically, they are the only ones who can help themselves - but picking on others isn't the way to go about it. In 2015, we desperately need a seismic shift in female societal thinking so that women can say loud and proud that they\u2019re beautiful - and not fear reprisals. Otherwise cynical advertising campaigns - in a bid to flog toiletries - will continue to exploit us just like this one has 'beautifully' done.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nIt's hard to know quite what motivated the Duke of York to rescue teenage sex slaves in India at the same time he faced damning allegations that he had slept with one in America. But one thing is for certain: it definitely took guts. With a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion, it can be revealed that Prince Andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in Calcutta. Rescued from brothels and domestic servitude, child labour and human trafficking, the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called Key to Freedom. Moved: Prince Andrew during his visit to an Indian refuge in 2012, which inspired him to form the charity . Their kimonos, duster coats, pyjamas, scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the British High Street by Topshop, with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary. What makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after Andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with American \u2018sex slave\u2019 Virginia Roberts, who had been working for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire. The claims, furiously denied by the Duke, have now been struck out of American court records, effectively clearing his name. He was inspired to launch Key to Freedom after visiting a girls\u2019 refuge on an official trip to India. He came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation and swiftly donated \u00a310,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, the Duke said: \u2018I was incredibly impressed with the work of the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation during my Diamond Jubilee visit to India in May 2012. \u2018I could see that it would be possible to complement [founder and chairman] Aloka Mitra\u2019s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products. It is incredible to see what the team has achieved. Roberts had been working for Andrew's former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire (pictured together above) \u2018I am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the United Kingdom. \u2018Most importantly, this has helped the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation support more young people to develop skills, which is an important area of focus for my work.\u2019 One of the young women who moved him so deeply was Anita, now 19. She was chosen to show the Duke how to block-print silk when he visited the refuge. In return, he left two copies of Little Red\u2019s Summer Adventure, a book written by his former wife Sarah. The child of two tea garden labourers from northern Bengal, Anita was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends. Lured to New Delhi with the promise of a job to help her support her family, she escaped only to find herself living as a \u2018railway child\u2019 at the city\u2019s station. Illiterate and destitute, she had no way home until she was taken in by the WIF where she met the Duke on his trip. She was among the first girls to sign up to Key to Freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees \u2013 approximately \u00a3430 \u2013 supplying silk goods to Topshop. She has also been reunited with her family near Darjeeling. \u2018We traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted,\u2019 revealed Aloka. \u2018Once we had told them her real story and that she\u2019d learned English and Bengali and maths, and that she had a craft and was earning a living, they changed their mind.\u2019 Anita said: \u2018I am doing well now and so is my mother. She was sick and I have been able to pay for medical treatment for her. \u2018I have earned almost 40,000 rupees through Key to Freedom and I have a skill which will help my future. I hope I keep getting orders for my work. I hope it won\u2019t stop.\u2019 Prince Andrew\u2019s 25-year-old daughter, Princess Eugenie, and his former wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have both paid private visits to help support the charity, and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative. The Duke\u2019s eldest daughter Beatrice, 26, was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months, although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in New York. Eugenie also works in the city for an online auction house. Other workers with Key to Freedom include Taralika, 25, who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home. \u2018She was locked up in a brothel and beaten, and then starved for days for refusing to have sex,\u2019 said Aloka. Profits: About \u00a320,000 from Topshop sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their UK stores . \u2018Finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police. She was, and still remains, mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she\u2019s making excellent progress. She is happy and confident working as a tailor.\u2019 Another Key to Freedom success story is Shila, 21, an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of Calcutta. Aloka said: \u2018She now has a bank account like any other working woman. It has totally changed her life. \u2018Poverty makes these women victims. They suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn. They live with abuse \u2013 mental, physical and sexual \u2013 just to be certain of food and shelter. \u2018The Duke understood that and wanted to make a difference \u2013 as the father of two daughters I think the plight of the girls here resonated with him. \u2018He wanted to given them their independence. Handmade: A silk Topshop kimono . \u2018There was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit. The only thing he asked me was, \u201cWhat do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls?\u201d \u2018I spoke to him about alternative income earning, a regular outlet to sell their work, and skills development to make their craft more marketable. His aides called less than an hour after he\u2019d left and set up a meeting the same night. \u2018He had already spoken to the Duchess of York about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could. The name Key to Freedom was her idea.\u2019 Aloka added: \u2018While I understood that their heart was in the right place, I also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought. \u2018Not only did they find the time, they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today. \u2018It was Prince Andrew\u2019s skills at connecting businesses that linked us to Topshop. It\u2019s nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the UK.\u2019 Aloka came to London for talks with the Duke\u2019s team at Buckingham Palace just three months after their initial meeting, and by summer 2013 Key to Freedom was up and running. It fulfilled its first order to Topshop, every piece individually signed by the woman who made it, in July 2013. Since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold. Yesterday, the High Street giant, which sent designer Penny McIvor to India to assist with colours, patterns and quality control, confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year. Topshop declined to discuss sales figures, but it is understood around \u00a320,000 has so far been paid by the company, which makes no profit from the scheme, to the Prince Andrew Charitable Foundation. This then sends the money back to Key to Freedom in Calcutta. In addition, the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of Prince Andrew\u2019s Pitch@Palace events for entrepreneurs last month, where 200 of its scarves were also on sale. The scheme is another of his business-to-business initiatives uniting start-ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors, venture capitalists and mentors. A Buckingham Palace source said that the Prince remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity \u2013 such as Pitch@Palace \u2013 to promote it. \u2018It\u2019s been completely empowering for the girls here,\u2019 said Aloka. \u2018It\u2019s about honour and dignity, and having control over their own future. \u2018It means they can look ahead and put their past behind them.\u2019",

The Homeless Period project hopes to shred the taboo around females living on the streets and their monthly cycle, and is encouraging people to donate tampons and towels to their local homeless shelter. A campaign video  tells the story of a woman called Patricia, who slept rough on the streets of Brixton for six months and was forced to use\u00a0makeshift sanitary products while menstruating. Scroll down for video . The Homeless Period campaign shines a spotlight on the plight of women living on the streets who don't have access to proper sanitary care during their periods . The team behind the campaign, Oliver Frost, Josie Shedden and Sara Bakhaty, wrote hard-hitting messages on cardboard boxes and photographed them on the streets of London . Using marker pens on cardboard boxes, the video writes the words of Patricia as she speaks them; focusing on how depressing she found it to not be able to access hygienic menstruation products. Patricia, who used to sleep on the 137 bus in Brixton Hill, says that when her period came, she would use 'ripped up cloth' as a  sanitary towel.\u00a0She has since been housed in a flat by South London homeless charity Spires. Among the cardboard placards held up are the words: 'Why does a woman have to rip up a cloth put between her to protect herself from bleeding?' Another is written with the words: 'I used to feel very depressed. It used to get me down.' The project was started by Oliver Frost, Josie Shedden and Sara Bakhaty, who met while working as interns at an advertising agency. The trio told FEMAIL that they began the campaign as a way of drawing attention to the amount of women who live on the streets after realising that society considered homelessness to be a 'male' issue. The campaign has prompted supporters to start their own collection boxes for tampons and sanitary towels: this (pictured above) was one of seven boxes collected in the workplace of Twitter user Sarah Wyatt . While homeless shelters receive funding for condoms, there is currently no government funding to supply charities with aid for sanitary products . They said that they were surprised to find that approximately 26 per cent of people who access homelessness services are women. Oliver Frost adds that periods seem to be a forgotten issue when it comes to living on the streets. 'It's that for many people, it's never even crossed their minds. As we say on the campaign site \"It doesn't bear thinking about\u2026 and that's the problem\".' While there is public funding for condoms to be supplied to homeless shelters, there is no financial aid for tampons and sanitary towels. Nearly 81,000 people have signed a petition to lobby the government for better funding to buy sanitary care. Frost says he hopes that the petition will 'promise a more long term solution to the issue, and the amount of funding it would need is relatively small.' The group aims to present the petition to the Secretary of Health or if they reach their 150,000 signature target before a new government is elected, then to lobby Simon Stevens,\u00a0Chief Executive of the NHS. A campaign video includes the voice of Patricia, who lived for six months on the streets of Brixton. She says she was forced to used ripped up cloth as a makeshift sanitary towel . Frost said donations are key to the campaign's success: 'For us, the hope is that #TheHomelessPeriod will become a platform for people wanting to help with donations. 'We've had people from around the country contact us with their own local initiatives and fundraisers for the campaign. Our side is in promoting those efforts and connecting them with other people who want to help.' Supporters have been dropping boxes of tampons and towels into their local homeless shelters, with one donor, Sarah Wyatt, so inspired that she has set up a crowd-funding page to encourage more people to donate. On her gofundme page, Wyatt says: 'I recently read an article about the lives of homeless women and the difficulties they face when they have their period. 'I had never really thought about it that way before, these women have little or no access to sanitary products. I decided to do something and did a collection in my workplace which got an amazing response.'",

With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you\u2019re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don\u2019t do that.'",

And Ibe took to Instagram, to show off his ability to perform the dance move, that many people around the country wish they could replicate. Jordon Ibe posted on Instagram, the video of him performing the moonwalk while he recovers from injury . The midfielder showed off some impressive moves as he steps up his recovery from a knee problem . He said: 'Having a little mess around, back training in a few days... #OoohKillem #MJ.'

The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston as Derek Lyle, Gavin Reilly and a Lee Wallace own goal gave Queen of the South\u2019s play-off hopes a massive boost. But McCall is adamant that confidence will not be dented by the scale of the loss and he expects his players to bounce back in Sunday\u2019s home meeting with Raith Rovers. Stuart McCall  urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure . The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston . \u2018We\u2019ve already spoken about going into the play-offs with good momentum,\u2019 said McCall. \u2018Tonight is a set-back but we\u2019ve got to make sure on Sunday that we don\u2019t have another set-back or then it can become a problem. \u2018We will be fully focused on Sunday and we will be looking for the three points. \u2018There will be no confidence factor come Sunday \u2014 I can assure you of that. Sometimes you get beat and you just have to hold your hands up and give credit to the opposition. \u2018I was pleased with certain things leading up to their first goal. I thought we were doing well. \u2018I said to the lads that we will put a line under it. Yeah, we know we weren\u2019t good tonight but we will be good on Sunday.\u2019 Rangers remain third in the table \u2014 behind Hibernian on goal difference but with a game in hand \u2014 after what was their biggest-ever loss to Queens. \u2018Fair play to them,\u2019 said McCall, who expects Cammy Bell to be fit to face Raith after a minor knee injury. \u2018They were clinical when they had their chances. New manager McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after doubling Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . \u2018We controlled large parts of the first half but they got a lot of good blocks in. It\u2019s about scoring goals and they got the first one. \u2018Then we lost a goal that was really poor defending straight from the kick-off. Then you are chasing the game and that suited them with their pace on the counter attack. \u2018We had some chances in the second half but we never really did enough. We weren\u2019t good enough to win the game but we move on. \u2018I\u2019ve said it before and I will say it again, there will be ups and downs between now and the end of the season. It\u2019s how we react to it, and Sunday can\u2019 t come quickly enough for me.\u2019 Jubilant Queen of the South boss James Fowler was thrilled with a result that saw his team leapfrog Falkirk into that crucial fourth place in the Championship standings. \u2018We were backs to the wall a wee bit in the first half,\u2019 admitted Fowler. \u2018But we managed to cope with that. We got the goal and then getting another one so early in the second half was great. \u2018All the players were great and we are pushing hard.\u2019",

The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting.

Lucian Faggiano's dream of opening a restaurant was scuppered when a dig to find a blocked sewage point yielded some 2,000 years of hidden history, including vast rooms and pottery (shown in this image that features Mr Faggiano left and his son) In a bid to stop the sewage backing up, Mr Faggiano, 60, and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 Via Ascanio Grandi,The New York Times reported. The search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium. Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and an important trading post for the Romans. But the first layers of the city date to the time of Homer, according to local historian Mario De Marco. Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the building has been turned into Museum Faggiano (pictured) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family . He imagined it would take a week to dig down and fix the plumbing beneath the building, but instead, the DIY mission led to the discovery of a Messapian tomb, a Roman granary (pictured left), a Franciscan chapel - and even etchings from the Knights Templar. An ancient room beneath the modern building is shown right . The search for the pipe (shown in this image of Mr Faggiano and his son) began at the turn of the millennium when no-one could have predicted the treasures hidden beneath the floorboards, which revealed a subterranean world dating back to before the birth of Jesus . It is not unusual for religious relics to turn up in fields or in the middle of the city itself, which has a mixture of old architecture . For example, a century ago, a Roman amphitheatre was recently found beneath a marble column bearing the statue of Lecce\u2019s patron saint, Orontius in the main square and recently a Roman temple was found under a car park. \u2018Whenever you dig a hole, centuries of history come out,\u2019 said Severo Martini, a member of the City Council. Years of excavations have seen the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Here, Mr Faggiano carries a piece of Roman pottery from an underground room . The building yielded plenty of nooks and crannies including mysterious shafts (pictured left and right) which lead to older parts of the building deeper and deeper underground . Lucian Faggiano bought the seemingly standard building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy, (marked on this map) but his dream of turning it into a trattoria was put on hold thanks to a broken toilet.\u00a0Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and a trading post for the Romans . The origins of Lecce in southern Italy are thought to be more than 2,000 years old. It was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, explaining the city's Greek culture. According to legend, a city called Sybar existed at the time of the Trojan War and was founded by the Messapii. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, who gave it the name Lupiae, which later became Lecce. Under the emperor Hadrian, in the second century AD, the city moved two miles (3km) northeast, got a theatre and an amphitheatre and was connected to the Hadrian Port. Oronotius of Lecce, who is known as Sant'Oronzo is thought to have served as the city's first Christian bishop and is now Lecce's patron saint. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was sacked by king Totila in the Gothic Wars. After that it was conquered once again by the Byzantines in 549 and remained part of the Eastern Empire despite some small conquests. After the Normans arrived in the 11th century, Lecce grew in commercial importance again, having been an important trading post in Roman times. It grew rich and became one of the most important cities in southern Italy, evidenced by its many impressive Baroque monuments. Plague broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to Allied fighters fighting the Nazis in the Second World War. Mr Faggiano asked his sons to help fix the problem with the plumbing so he could accelerate the opening of his restaurant, in a building that looked like it was modernised. But when they dug down they hit a floor of medieval stone, beneath which was a Messapian tomb, built by people who lived in the area before the birth of Jesus. Legend has it the city was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, but then the settlement was called Sybar. Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain, and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife, in part perhaps because he was lowering his youngest son, Davide, 12 though small gaps in the floor to aid his work. But his wife, Anna Maria San\u00f2 suspected the work was more complex than it appeared thanks to the amount of dirty clothes she was washing, and because of dirt and debris being taken away. Investigators shut down the site, warning Mr Faggiano he was conducting an unofficial archaeological dig. After a year, work continued but had to be overseen by heritage officials who witnessed the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Retired cultural heritage official, Giovanni Giangreco, who was involved with the excavation, said: \u2018The Faggiano house has layers that are representative of almost all of the city\u2019s history, from the Messapians to the Romans, from the medieval to the Byzantine time.\u2019 Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife. Here, he sorts though pieces of glass and pottery found in one of the rooms. There are even pieces embedded in the wall . Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. The cavernous property has been turned into a museum so visitors can easily see the remains (pictured) Mr Faggiano (pictured here with his son in an ancient underground room) admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant . Despite bearing the financial load of the dig, the family became fascinated about the history beneath their building and made ends meet by renting rooms in it. Mr Faggiano admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant. He said: \u2018At one point, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened.\u2019 Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the incredible building has been turned into Museum Faggiano and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers. However, Mr Faggiano hasn\u2019t given up on his culinary dream and is planning on opening a restaurant at a less complex location \u2013 even though he finally found the troublesome sewage pipe. Mr Faggiano, pictured here, said: \u2018At one point, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened\u2019",

'It gives us another 40 minutes, I know that,' said Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, who leads the Badgers to their first final since 1941. Wisconsin celebrate a 71-64 victory over Kentucky in the semi-finals of the NCAA Tournament . Wisconsin players run onto the court in celebration as Kentucky's unbeaten season was brought to an end . Wisconsin moved through to the final with a tense victory over Kentucky at the Lucas Oil Stadium . And Kentucky has a long ride home, finishing the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. Kaminsky and Bronson Koenig went 7 for 8 from the line over the last 24 seconds to seal the win. The 70,000-capacity Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home of the Colts in the NFL, is hosting the Final Four . Wisconsin Badgers fans cheer on their team at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis . Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled. He made only one free throw, and from there, Wisconsin clinched it from the foul-line. Earlier Saturday, Justise Winslow scored 19 points and Jahlil Okafor added 18 to lead top-seeded Duke to an 81-61 victory over Michigan State on Saturday and a shot at its fifth national championship. Winslow, who played through some early foul trouble, had nine rebounds and was 5 for 7 from the field, while Okafor grabbed six rebounds and was 7 for 11 from the field.

Senior Quinn Cook had 17 points for the Blue Devils, who dominated the game except for the opening minutes when they trailed 14-6. Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead. Trice scored 16 points and Branden Dawson added 12 for the Spartans.",

Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world No 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene\u2019s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Aljaz Bedene is pictured at his British citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday morning . Andy Murray says British players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking . Bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in Hatfield . Last year, when Bedene stated he intended to try to make the switch, the then British No 3 Dan Evans expressed some doubts about its legitimacy, wondering why he would wish to do it. But Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. \u2018If he was 500 in the world they wouldn\u2019t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit,\u2019 said the 27-year-old Scot. \u2018And he\u2019s obviously the British No 2, comfortably. \u2018So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He\u2019s British now so they\u2019ve just got to deal with it. \u2018I would hope that all the guys who are below him now, like James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup ties then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. \u2018He\u2019s a good player but so are James and Kyle, and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he\u2019s on the tour every week, the other guys aren\u2019t quite there yet.\u2019 Murray admits Bedene's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week . James Ward (left) and Kyle Edmund should try to use Bedene as motivation to get better as a player . Bedene (right) with girlfriend Kimalie, who is a pop singer in her native land of Slovenia . For the first time, Murray, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene: \u2018He\u2019s a good player with a very good serve. He\u2019s a legitimate top-100 player, when he plays challengers he\u2019s there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main tour he wins matches, it\u2019s not like he turns up and always loses in the first round. \u2018He had a bad (wrist) injury last year but has recovered well. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings, although I don\u2019t know exactly how high he can go. I\u2019ve practised with him a couple of times, I haven\u2019t seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would imagine he\u2019s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while.\u2019 Bedene can individually represent any country he wants where he holds a passport. The Davis Cup is a greyer area as from January 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the Slovenian squad three times \u2014 but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process. It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give support to his case but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: \u2018To have another player in the men\u2019s top 100 is clearly a positive thing and so we very much welcome Aljaz\u2019s change in citizenship.\u2019 Murray says Bedene is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings . Murray gets pumped up on his way to victory over Kevin Anderson at the Miami Open . Murray proudly poses with a cake, saying 'It's an amazing feeling' after winning his 500th game . Switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and Evans\u2019s questions have some pertinence to them. There is a recent precedent, however. Two years ago Australian Brydan Klein switched to represent GB by virtue of his mother originally being from Manchester. He subsequently struggled but his form has picked up and he is now ranked 210 in the world to make himself the national No 5. Last year that would have guaranteed a Wimbledon wildcard worth, minimally, a staggering \u00a327,000. However, there is now no automatic recommendation for a Championships wildcard for Brits ranked inside the top 250. The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally popular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairness to him, he proved true to his word.

'I will talk to everybody but Kevin is very, very happy with Wolfsburg and the way they have treated him since he arrived from Chelsea last year. 'There are still five games to play and hopefully they can make sure of a place in the Champions League next season so it is a little bit too early to be making any decisions.

Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, . Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to . an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of . Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the . theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart . Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 . A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist . This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught . 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they . think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are . threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the . Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and . threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined . to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, . 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the . museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair . allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs . in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on . the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces . Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . FBI investigators have long said they believed organized . crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed . a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked . if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court . testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the . stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police . uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most . recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of . illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms . The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum .",

Tutor Colin Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Rozina Khanim by a governor at the \u00a313,000-a-year independent Priory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham. The fee-paying school's facilities manager Kevin Bird walked in on the pair while they were engaged in a sex act during an entrance exam day. Colin Turnbull (left), 69, was caught having sex with 'model' Rozina Khanim (pictured left and right) in a classroom at a \u00a313,000-a-year Catholic private school in Birmingham . Caught: Mr Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Ms Khanim by a governor at the school . The school was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and 39-year-old Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on. The teacher has worked at the school for nine years, hiring out a room to offer private tuition to pupils looking to pass the 11+, The Mirror reported. Mr Turnbull has not commented on the tryst, but the school confirmed senior staff had told him to 'never return'. A school spokeswoman said:\u00a0'Once Mr Turnbull's behaviour was discovered by the school's facilities manager, he promptly informed the assistant headteacher. 'Mr Turnbull was challenged; he fully admitted improper behaviour and was then instructed by the assistant headteacher to leave the school site immediately and to not return.' She added that the teacher was not directly employed by the school but he did hire out the classroom for tuition. 'As far as the school is concerned, while behaviour of the sort alleged is wholly unacceptable in any circumstances, we understand from the advice taken from social services that Mr Turnbull had not engaged in any illegal activity. The Priory School (pictured) was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on . Elite: The independent Catholic school charges up to \u00a313,000 a year in fees for students to attend . 'There was no pupil involved, the incident was between Mr Turnbull and an adult female,' she added. School regulator Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the Department for Education were all informed of the incident. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Independent schools must adhere to the Independent School Standards. Any suggestion that schools are not doing so will be investigated.' Sources close to the school, however, said Mr Turnbull had been allowed to 'leave by the back door' and were angered that he would be able to continue teaching. Ms Khanim declined to comment but told the Birmingham Mail: 'That's not how it all happened.' The Priory School is attended by around 400 pupils, from 'Nursery and Poppets' classes up until sixth form. It charges fees of up to \u00a312,870 a year for its most senior students. On the school's website, its headmaster Jonathan Cramb says 'knowing what is right and wrong' allows teachers to get on with providing an education for pupils. More than 80 per cent of students got five GCSEs graded A* to C last year, well above the national average.",

And now that status update about jetting off on holiday is set to be even easier after Virgin Atlantic announced it would allow each passenger one Facebook login for free so they can post an update from 35,000ft. The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",

They topped a table of the most-loathed fees and charges in the poll by insurer Direct Line, followed by ATM cash withdrawal fees and debit and credit card surcharges for booking items such as air travel. Most-loathed: A poll found that parking charges topped the list of fees and charges that frustrate consumers the most. A total of 48 per cent thought they should be free, while 31 per cent said they are too high . Asked about their frustration with such charges, 48 per cent said they should be free, while 31 per cent thought they are too high and 15 per cent say they are often hidden. Direct Line spokesman Gus Park said: \u2018These types of fees and charges can be very frustrating because they tend to cover things that we either feel entitled to or think we have already paid for as part of another product or service.\u2019 It is hardly surprising that parking costs infuriate drivers as the fines are often extortionate compared to the price of a ticket.

Linn later said while pleading guilty to hate crime charges that he'd become enraged after seeing images of wounded soldiers in the news and decided to burn the mosque. He also blamed what happened on a day of heavy drinking. Being forgiven, he wrote last December, would 'probably give me a little bit of peace of mind.' Cherrefe Kadri, president of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, told The Blade said she waited nearly six weeks to respond to Linn's letter. Most of the members have moved on, she said. 'I think his letter was truly sincere, and I told him that,' she said. Her response, written on stationery with an image of the mosque at the top, said that she hopes he can make peace with God.

He was one of many veterans to respond to unedifying allegations that Zeta Beta Tau members had abused soldiers attending the Warrior Beach vacation retreat in Panama City Beach, the Gainesville Sun\u00a0reported. The charity event provides vacations for maimed soldiers, their carers and families - but ran afoul of braying frat boys holding an event of their own earlier this month. One veteran, wounded Nicholas Connole, said frat members spat on him and his service dog from their balconies. He told local TV station WJHG: 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts.' Haley Riley, whose husband is another injured veteran, said students hurled beer bottles at attendees. Linda Cope, who founded the retreat after her son lost both his legs in an IED explosion, said that rowdy students even went so far as to urinated on the American flag. Suspension: The Zeta Beta Tau chapter at the University of FLorida has been suspended, and three of its members expelled. There is nothing to suggest anybody in the photograph above was involved . Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was suspended in the wake of the allegations, which university authorities are investigating. They have charged the organization with 'causing physical or other harm, obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft and property damage'. The fraternity has expelled three members and is also holding its own investigation. The expelled frat members have not been named. It has yet to determine what exactly took place, but said in a statement that 'there is no doubt that some our members engaged in unacceptable behavior.' While Panama City Beach police were called to deal with the frat members, they ultimately let the resort management handle them, and did not file any charges or write a police report. Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was already on probation after being found guilty of holding hazing rituals at the start of this academic year. It was already restricted to a limited events program - and will face even tougher penalties than usual if the university decides to take action. Another Zeta Beta Tau chapter, belonging to Emory University in Georgia, was also caught up in the allegations, but has denied that any of its students were involved.",

A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to The Washington Post. \"The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her,\" and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he \"grabbed her arms when she resisted\" and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that  Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations \"very disturbing.\" \"Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. Earlier in September, an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched \"beyond its limits,\" needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. \"It's going to take time to change some of this culture,\" Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month. \"There's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain. That's going to take time because I'm going to have to build trust with our workforce.\" The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.",

First it was Britney and Christina, and now rapper Drake has been on the receiving end of a little lip action from Madge. While the blondes had fun with it, Drake appeared less than enthused after Madonna's prolonged smooch onstage at the Coachella music festival in California on Sunday. In an update Monday from \"champagnepapi\" himself on Instagram, the rapper clarified his reaction: \"Don't misinterpret my shock!! I got to make out with the queen Madonna and I feel 100 about that forever. Thank you @Madonna.\" After the kiss, though, he seemed dazed. \"Oh, s***. What the f*** just happened?\" he asked moments later from the stage.

He welcomed Madonna onstage as a special guest to perform a few songs. While wrapping up \"Human Nature,\" the Material Girl, 56, planted one on the seated Drake, 28, who began to flail his arms after a while in an apparent attempt to escape. His sour face after the encounter led many to speculate that he didn't enjoy the kiss. Of course, Drake and Madonna's little makeout sesh got the web talking and meme-ing: . \"So @Drake proves that kissing @Madonna is about as ghastly as I always imagined it would be,\" wrote former CNN personality Piers Morgan. \"Grandma: give Nana some suga .

Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a \"Most Wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's located in Kenya's North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\"  Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Adam said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" He said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Adam said. Five arrested in Kenya attack . Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as those who supported them. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

The study uncovered a link between belief in God and other societal characteristics, such as a strong social hierarchy. Scientists suggest that religious beliefs help people cope in inhospitable habitats. A study suggests that societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in all-powerful, deities. Here, people carry bags of popcorn through a Christian cemetery, to sell in a shanty town in Lima, Peru . \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland and a founding director of the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences in Jena, Germany. \u2018Prosocial behaviour [actions that help others] maybe helps people do well in harsh or unpredictable environments.\u2019 Together with other experts, he found that communities that believe in a high, controlling God or gods who enforce a moral code, tend to live in politically complex groups with a social hierarchy beyond the local community - and often tend to animals. While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre (Nescent) in Durham, North Carolina, implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland. Here, devotees prepare ritual rice dishes to offer to the Hindu sun god as they attend Pongal celebrations, at a slum in Mumbai . The UK is one of the least religious places in the world, according to a new survey. In a global ranking of 65 countries, the UK came sixth from last, with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious. This compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are \u2018convinced atheists\u2019, with the remaining Britons saying they \u2018did not know\u2019. In contrast, 94 per cent of people in Thailand deem themselves religious, with Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia and Morocco completing the top five, with 93 per cent each. At the bottom of the list was China, where 61 per cent of people are atheists, with only six per cent regarding themselves as religious. It was followed by Japan where just 13 per cent are religious, Sweden with 19 per cent and the Czech Republic on 23 per cent. Globally two-thirds of people consider themselves religious. Those under the age of 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups, the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found. People without a formal education were also more likely to practice a faith. \u2018When researchers discuss the forces that shaped human history, there is considerable disagreement as to whether our behaviour is primarily determined by culture or by the environment,\" said primary author Carlos Botero, of North Carolina State University. \u2018We wanted to throw away all preconceived notions regarding these processes and look at all the potential drivers together to see how different aspects of the human experience may have contributed to the behavioural patterns we see today.\u2019 The study, published in PNAS, took into account variables associated with the environment, history, and culture and involved experts in biology, ecology, linguistics, anthropology, and theology. It began when evolutionary ecologist Dr Botero plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising, high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds. He took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion, and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation. Professor Gray said: \u2018Although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive, the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically, we get some insight.\u2019 While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study  implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. Here, Muslims on the outskirts of New Delhi participate in Friday prayers at a slum area during the holy month of Ramadan . The team used historical, social, and ecological data, such as plant growth, rain and temperature, for 583 societies to illustrate the multifaceted relationship between belief in moralising, high gods and external variables. They used the Ethograhic Atlas, which was collated during the last century, to pinpoint communities around the world and access data about religious beliefs, agriculture, and animal husbandry. \u2018The goal became not just to look at the ecological variables, but to look at the whole thing. 'Once we accounted for as many other factors as we could, we wanted to see if we could still detect an environmental effect,\u2019 Dr Botero said. \u2018The overall picture is that these beliefs are ultimately shaped by a combination of historical, ecological, and social factors.\u2019 Dr Botero believes that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in examining human behaviour from a cross-disciplinary standpoint. The team plans to further their study by exploring the processes that have influenced the evolution of other human behaviours including taboos, circumcision, and the modification of natural habitats. Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous - a phenomenon known as The Scrooge Effect, after the Dickens character (shown) Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous, according to a new study. It also boosts the feeling of pleasure we get from doing a good deed. \u2018Acting pro-socially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety, and in turn produces psychological satisfaction,\u2019 researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. The study builds on the terror management theory, which says that humans deal with our fear of death by believing in an afterlife or devoting our lives to a cause that will live on, Pacific Standard reported. Previous work found that Americans reminded of their own mortaility gave more money to a charity that said it would help people in the country, than one that had an international focus. It suggested that thoughts of death made people strengthen their beliefs - such as allegiance to a religion or country \u2013 and is known as The Scrooge Effect. The new study included an experiment, where people were asked to split $8 between themselves and a stranger, while reporting their own satisfaction. Before this, Polish student participants were asked to fill out a survey about death, or dealing with a trip to the dentists, then complete a crossword. The researchers found that volunteers who had previously thought about death gave more money to the stranger and said they felt happier doing it. The experiment seems to bolster The Scrooge Effect and suggests that reinforcing a person\u2019s self-image of being generous, or supporting a cause, are effective ways of managing fear of dying.",

Nobody else would get close. This has been his best season in a Chelsea shirt. Two seasons ago Rafa Benitez said he couldn\u2019t cope with two games a week. That will have frightened the life out of John. So credit Jose Mourinho for trusting him and building that defence around him. Terry has never had pace but that is not a problem as he reads the game so well. He didn\u2019t break sweat against Arsenal and Chelsea were too streetwise for Arsene Wenger\u2019s team. John Terry celebrates after the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium . Chelsea are undefeated against the top four this season where Arsenal have lost twice \u2014 that is the gap Wenger\u2019s side need to bridge and Terry has been a huge part of that. I remember playing against him early in his career and after I tackled Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, he clattered right into me \u2014 he wasn\u2019t going to let me put one on his team-mate. That\u2019s when I knew he could grow up to be a special player. Terry  celebrates with his team-mates after the Premier League draw against Arsenal in north London . One Hull of a result . Beating Crystal Palace was a massive result for Steve Bruce. Their run-in is horrendous and had they lost at Selhurst Park, surely it was all over. It shows how football fortunes can change in an instant. Hull are not the best away from home but as the stats below show, they thoroughly deserved their win. Dame N\u2019Doye was the star and could have had a hatful but I love the way he took his second. That little delay of his foot was just enough to put the defender off balance and give him a sight of goal before firing it in. Bruce had to move quickly to sign him on deadline day in February but N\u2019Doye has done well since joining from Lokomotiv Moscow. If he carries on like this and Hull stay up they might have to build a statue outside the ground! Dame N'Doye  celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Premier League win against Crystal Palace . Can Manuel still be the man? After recent results, people say Manuel Pellegrini is a dead man walking. Beating Aston Villa was important but can he keep his job under so much pressure? Deciding Pellegrini\u2019s fate will be one of the toughest choices Man City\u2019s owners have faced. I spoke to Frank Lampard and he says they are fantastic people \u2014 there is no desire to chop and change. City are so close. They have world class training facilities, an expanding stadium and absolute fortunes to spend. But this season has been a blip. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during the Premier League match against Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium . Pellegrini won two trophies last year, so they could keep him and let him rebuild. Recruitment has been poor and they need to get it right in the summer. But it\u2019s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year. If he is sacked, who gets the job? Pep Guardiola is the dream but it would take a major fallout for him to leave Bayern. Patrick Vieira has the tools but no experience, Jurgen Klopp would be appointed on past success and Diego Simeone is an underdog manager. City want style. There is no shame losing to Barcelona, it\u2019s the defeats to the likes of Burnley and Stoke that have hurt Pellegrini. City could still get rid of him, but I\u2019m sure it would be with a heavy heart. Manchester City are dreaming of Pep Guardiola but it's unlikely the Bayern boss will make the move to City . Flying Foxes . Talk about timing your run. Leicester are in amazing form. Four straight wins is good for any side, let alone one facing a relegation battle. It\u2019s been a tough season for Nigel Pearson with all the drama of him being \u2018sacked\u2019 and reinstated, but he has got his team flying at exactly the right time. Home disadvantage? There were only two home wins this weekend with three away and five draws. At this stage in the season sometimes it\u2019s far easier to play with freedom on the road than under huge pressure at home. Toon's poor show . The way Newcastle are going I would not be surprised if they don\u2019t get a single point between now and the end of the season. They have been an embarrassment. It\u2019s as if they are in the clubhouse with 35 points. They don\u2019t look like adding to that any time soon and anybody with Newcastle in their run-in has got a chance of a result. A deflated Jack Colback and Siem de Jong trudge off the pitch following yet another Newcastle defeat . The Newcastle players react as they suffer yet another defeat, this time to Premier League rivals Swansea . Chaos at Watford, but it works . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates scoring for Watford against Brighton at the Amex Stadium . Watford have spent 20 days at the top of the Championship table. Bournemouth, who are on the verge of promotion, have led for 111 days. Congratulations to Watford after their promotion, but if ever you want an example of how not to run a club, they have been it this season! With unpredictable owners, four different managers and a host of key players on loan, it has been chaos. They have been outsiders throughout but have come through when it counts. I\u2019ve loved watching Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo bang in the goals and you can\u2019t argue with the results. It just shows you there\u2019s no right or wrong in football. The Watford players celebrate victory against Brighton as they all but secure their promotion to the big time . United slip up . Two weeks ago Man United had all the answers but two defeats later it\u2019s back to the drawing board. It\u2019s not that they have been found out, but maybe they are not as good as people thought. They were just in good form. They have had the luxury of playing with no European football this season so still have work to do in the summer. It\u2019s the same feeling with Everton. They started the season dreadfully but have won five out of six. I\u2019m a Roberto Martinez fan and they have good players so we should not be surprised that things have changed. Louis van Gaal watches on as his Manchester United side are comprehensively beaten by Everton . Paying the penalty . Why oh why did Danny Ings not take that penalty for Burnley? Yes, he is out of form and without a goal since February but what better way to get back on the scoresheet? He took one against Aston Villa in November and scored and he and Burnley needed that goal. Then to make things worse Leicester go up the other end and score 27 seconds later. Burnley midfielder Matthew Taylor holds his head after missing the chance to score from the spot . It was a similar story at QPR. Charlie Austin\u2019s goals have kept his side going this season but he has missed two big penalties now \u2014 against Hull and West Ham. When every goal is so vital you can\u2019t afford to pass up these chances. PS If QPR go down, Austin won\u2019t be the only player with plenty of suitors. Matt Phillips has been scoring and setting up good goals in the run-in. He is a useful Premier League player. Charlie Austin looks on angrily following his penalty miss against West Ham United at Loftus Road .",

Mr Philp claimed he had no recollection of vandalising the car and that it was out of character for him. Magistrate Michael Quinn reminded him he had a number of similar convictions on his criminal record, but Mr Philp said these were a long time ago and he wanted to 'change things.'

But for one New York-based writer, the urge to stand in front of a mirror and poke at and squeeze her pores for hours on end became so bad that it actually started 'sabotaging' her life. In an inspiring essay for\u00a0Marie Claire,\u00a0Jenna Marotta, 27, tells of her experience with dermatillomania - a\u00a0compulsive\u00a0skin-picking disorder that left her face bleeding - and how she managed to overcome it. 'I'd descend \"into the mirror\" for up to four hours a day,' Jenna writes in the essay, explaining how her actions horrified her parents. 'I would nick and squeeze and yank at every clogged pore on my face.' Scroll down for video . Obsessive behavior: Jenna Marotta, 27, of New York, says her habit of picking at the pores on her face was so all-consuming that it became 'self-sabotaging' At first, Jenna was just looking for a way to break out of her binge-eating routine. As a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch, then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home. Her binge-eating cycle continued through college and after graduation, when she moved back home to her parents' house in Illinois. 'I knew I was bingeing while I was bingeing,' she writes, adding that part of the problem was that she would head to the kitchen whenever she felt bored. 'So I decided to find a new place to spend my ample downtime.' That place became her parents' bathroom, where her mom kept a stainless steel 10x magnifying mirror and an array of Tweezerman tweezers. Jenna's use of the tweezers started off innocently enough, with her plucking out stray hairs along her eyebrows. Then she started to become obsessive, revisiting her brows several times a day and moving on to other areas of her face, where she would use those same tweezers to clear out pores and remove ingrown hairs. 'At one point, I became convinced that there was a lone dark hair trapped under my chin,' she says. 'I could think of nothing more vital than removing this growth from my face. In the process of freeing the (probably imagined) hair, I dug an eighth-inch deep hole.' Getting better: After accidentally going ten days without touching her pores when she forgot to pack her tweezers for a trip, Jenna managed to move away from her bad skin habit. She still sees a psychiatrist . Jenna was aware that her skin-picking was growing out of control and visited a 'battalion' of dermatologists, who told her that her problem was psychosomatic. So she enrolled in an an outpatient program for mental health. But once the three-week program ended, she insisted she had her problem under enough control to move on her own to New York City. The problem was not under control, however. Though the dreaded magnifying mirror was back at her parents' house in Illinois, Jenna would still lean in close to her own bathroom mirror to pick at her pores. 'I would tweeze and squeeze, filling my garbage can with tissues dotted with blood,' she writes, adding that she would hide out in her bedroom to avoid seeing her roommate, who might question her about the bloody tissues she threw out in the bathroom. And she didn't stop at using tweezers. Jenna admitted that she's also 'attacked' her face with an extruder, an earring post, an unspooled paperclip, a pushpin, a toothbrush handle, the rough side of a nail file, lotion caps, and nail clippers. One of Jenna's most agonizing memories was when the writer had to interview Steve Carrell after picking at a cyst on her chin until it bled. She worried the blood wouldn't dry in time to apply makeup before the interview. 'The urge to self-injure just always pulses through my head and hands,' she says. 'And it's my go-to method of procrastination when I have a deadline.' Luckily, while travelling to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this January, Jenna forgot her tweezers at home, resulting in ten whole days during which she didn't pick at her face. Now, the 27-year-old says she has overcome her condition - and is working on being 'nice' to herself. 'I continue to work with a psychiatrist to stay on track since I first put the tweezers down,' she says. Dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterized by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one's skin. Some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged. Sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body. The condition is often categorized as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). It can lead to bleeding, bruising and infections. CSP will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour. The skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels. However, once the damage has been done, those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness. Although the damage that is caused can be very severe, the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out CSP again and again. Treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. Source: Anxiety UK .",

A gambling addict stole more than \u00a322,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number,\u00a0cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into\u00a0care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to \u00a3200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing \u00a322,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just \u00a31,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was  discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash\u00a0withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for\u00a0the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said:\u00a0'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has\u00a0really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing.\u00a0'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said:\u00a0'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting\u00a0for it for a long time. 'She does take full responsibility - and realises the impact it has had on\u00a0the family. Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley . 'This offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking\u00a0after the victim's finances. Her gambling spiralled out of control. 'She tried to take her own life.' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and\u00a0seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you. And the fact the funds you\u00a0took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to\u00a0some extent to pay for his care home fees. 'I can't ignore the fact that addictions do exist and there is no other\u00a0motivation.' She was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid\u00a0work and be part of a supervision requirement for 18 months. The judge also stated that \u00a31,350 would be confiscated for compensation and any sums recovered in the future should be paid to Mr Woodrow. Stoneman  was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid work at Leicester Crown Court .",

Despite recent gains, only 126,000 jobs were added, the lowest since December 2013. Wages remain sluggish. And unemployment may still be at 5.5%, but there is wide concern among labor experts and economists that too much job growth is in part-time low-income work. Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy. Nearly 60% of the people in America's workforce are paid hourly and work part-time. Most part-time employees are doing low-wage work. Tackling this growing trend is complex. But there is a simple step we can take to improve the conditions of low-wage workers today. Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules. Here is how this issue works: . America's major fast-food chains, retailers and department stores use \"just-in-time\" scheduling to maximize profit, which in turn creates unstable and stressful work environments for low-wage workers. This type of scheduling has increased dramatically because of sophisticated software that ties staffing to expected customer traffic. Algorithms, built on sales and economic data, provide real-time information for managers to make personnel adjustments. Not surprisingly, such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low-wage workers. Hourly low-income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full-time employees.  Many don't even know their weekly schedules until the last moment. A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules. Imagine dealing with this as you are trying to earn a basic living, find reliable child care, get new vocational skills, or attend to medical needs. Women and workers of color most acutely struggle with this practice. Women comprise over two-thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low-wage jobs like home health care, fast food work, and cash services. Similarly, a large proportion of minorities work low-wage jobs. Nearly 50% of African-Americans and Latinos receive their hours with a week or less notice. By comparison, almost 40%  of whites receive weekly notice. Minorities also have much less of an ability to control their hours. Only 10% of Latinos and 12% of black workers reported being able to set their hours within certain limits or freely. Within this same context, 18% of whites said they could. Child care is the primary casualty of just-in-time scheduling. Because of erratic shifts, child care centers often can't accommodate a working mother's schedule. Many must attend to informal arrangements, which by nature are unstable and unreliable. Traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers. Unions, for example, have provided little protection against just-in-time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy. Real solutions exist. States and cities are enacting laws to address scheduling abuses. New York, Minnesota and Michigan previously introduced promising legislation. And in December, San Francisco became the first jurisdiction to pass a \"retail worker bill of rights.\" This ordinance limits how chain stores can alter their employees' schedules. Still, there is no substitute for federal action. Too many people work in states with little protection. Washington ignores the problem because congressional Republicans have shown little interest in the plight of low-wage workers. Last summer, The Schedules that Work Act was introduced in Congress. According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss. Although the bill expired last session it will likely be reintroduced. And yet the bill will most likely not pass. Congressional Republicans have demonstrated they are more interested in unraveling worker protections under the guise of supporting economic growth. Conservatives should embrace this work-schedule legislation. The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work. Protecting shift workers is likewise good for business. Studies show that workers who exercise greater control over their hours are happier and more efficient. Conversely, just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction. While Washington stalls, it's everyday Americans who are hurt. It's the single mom in Chattanooga working as a Walmart cashier who's juggling work and childcare for her kids. It's the Arby's line cook in Fort Worth who needs reliable shifts to make her dialysis treatments. It's the stock man at an Amazon fulfillment center in Lehigh Valley who can't get his son to pre-algebra tutoring because of his erratic shifts. Our leaders have the unique responsibility to protect America and attend to the critical economic challenges of our time. Even with the weaker-than-expected jobs report we know our overall economy is improving, yet income-inequality is deepening. Congress must endorse a recovery that's inclusive, livable, and one that enables every family to balance competing obligations. They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.",

Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment: \u00a0This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady\u2019s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead\u2019s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration:\u00a0Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .",

The government has approved funding for Cambridgeshire-based Mole Solutions to develop the idea as an alternative to the conventional systems of transporting goods by road. The plan, called the Mole Urban project, aims to reduce the level of road freight within urban areas by using freight pipelines carrying goods in capsules to edge of town consolidation centres, where they would be collected. Scroll down for video . One of the Mole Solutions capsules inside one of their pipelines at their testing site in Northampton . A graphic showing how the Mole Urban project would work by sending freight in underground pipes rather than on the road . The firm is now looking to see if the concept could be used within the town of Northampton and if results are positive, a pilot could see underground pipelines installed to transport goods. The development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other towns, although it is still a long way from fruition. The proposal, would see the driverless capsules propelled by a magnetic wave produced by linear induction motors. A track has already been constructed in Northampton to test the capsules with data being collected on commercial and environmental influences. However, the firm say that even irrespective of the final results for the test case, the process established in the project can be used to assess other locations that have major congestion and pollution problems caused by excess road usage. The development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other towns . Dr Roger Miles, head of Mole Solutions told the Independent: 'Clean water is taken into homes and dirty water is taken away and we never really see it, while huge amounts of oil and diesel are transported by pipes and underground. 'Now we want to do something similar with freight, delivering goods to buildings and taking away waste.' The concept has already had funding from the government and is also attracting support from private businesses too. The company is already one of several businesses that have attracted support from the Transport Systems Catapult, a government-funded centre set up to support innovation in transport. The Transport Systems Catapult is currently working with the UK Government and over 70 major multinationals on \u2018Intelligent Mobility\u2019 inventions with major market potential, including driverless cars, underground sensors and freight pipelines. The technology comes after Amazon announced they had been carrying out a secret research project which would see packages from the company delivered by drone. Amazon has approached the British Government about trialling its flying Amazon Prime Air service in the UK. One of its prototype delivery drones is pictured . In December 2013, the internet shopping giant\u2019s chief executive Jeff Bezos says that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes. Customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber. And last month, it was reported that Amazon is said to have approached the British Government to launch a trial of the technology in Britain.",

'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion \u2014 continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow. Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 14, 2014. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.",

It all started with a birthday party that little Damani Terry was attending. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. The distraught driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy. But it was too late, police said. Damani was dead. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. That was not the end of the situation. Soon, two more people would also die: the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man, police said. That man, identified as Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, was located late Wednesday at a Chicago-area hotel. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. \"Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm,\" the police chief said Thursday. An accidental death, a fatal retaliation rips apart two families . Damani's family members had previously identified the shooting suspect as the boys' uncle. \"Sunday was the worst day I ever lived in my whole entire life,\" Lena Tidwell, told CNN affiliate WISN. \"It's a day I wish had never, never came.\" Tidwell is the boys' grandmother and the mother of the alleged gunman. She said she was inside eating cake and ice cream at the birthday when her life turned upside down. \"I didn't know my grandbaby got hit, and then I heard people just screaming,\" she said. \"Then I just heard gunshots, and my daughter ran in the house with the baby in her arms.\" The family believes the uncle targeted Brown, and Rasheed was struck by an errant bullet. \"I heard he was trying to pick his brother up. He was trying to hold him and save him,\" a family friend, Stephanie Townsend, told CNN affiliate WITI. Earlier this week, Flynn bemoaned the apparent madness of what happened. \"What did we have Sunday?\" Flynn asked. \"We had some clown take the law into his own hands and murder a guy who was doing what we expect good citizens to do, and oops, accidentally kill somebody else.\"",

Health experts in the US have warned the country is in danger of being gripped by a measles pandemic because a growing number of people are not getting vaccinated against the virus and are being exposed to the rest of the population. The virus has swept several states in America and California and officials have warned there could be a danger of reversing the eradication of measles 15 years ago. They are also keen to prevent a return to the outbreak of 1989 when more than 100 people died. Scroll down for video . More than 100 pupils have been kicked out of their classes because they did not have completed vaccination forms, as health officials have warned about the danger of the spread of the measles virus (pictured) This week 143 pupils were removed from their classes in Spokane because they could not prove they had legally required vaccinations, which includes measles. And officials predict the number of children being kicked out of school in the state for not getting their jabs is likely to rise, as around 700 students in the district lack complete documents. Earlier this year,\u00a0Tom Frieden, director of\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he was concerned about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in America. He said there was concern over the growing number of people choosing not to have their injections to prevent the highly infectious disease and has called for more people to be vaccinated . In February around 100 people were diagnosed with the virus across 15 states.\u00a0Last month officials in California confirmed 119 people had been diagnosed with measles after visiting Disneyland in Anaheim. The outbreak is believed to have started when an overseas tourist with measles visited the theme park. American officials are calling for children to be vaccinated against measles in order to prevent a pandemic . Spokane school district officials are believed to be the first to remove children from schools in a bid to prevent the spread of measles. District spokesman Kevin Morrison said:\u00a0'We're the front-runners . 'Given the increased awareness that the world has of the possibility of pandemic, I think heightened awareness is certainly not a bad thing.' Mr Morrison said complete documentation is important to protecting students so that if there was an outbreak at school staff would know which students to send home. Measles is a highly infectious disease that is characterised by a rash, runny nose and fever. In extreme cases it can be fatal. Children are routinely protected against the virus through the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine but some parents choose not to allow their children to have the jab because they personally disagree with it or due to problems with their offspring's immune system. Dr Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control said the spread of measles could increase because of a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated being exposed to the population . Pupils in Spokane were removed from school on Monday and will be allowed to return once their parents either get the required vaccinations, or sign waivers saying they were opposed to one or more vaccinations, Mr Morrison confirmed. The Spokane district has about 30,000 students, and only about 729 students lack the required documentation. Mr Morrison did not speculate on whether other school districts in the region or the state would follow. After the measles outbreak, Spokane district officials discovered about six percent of their students lacked proper vaccination documentation. In February they launched a program to inform parents that their children needed vaccinations or waivers. The school district and the Spokane Regional Health District also held a series of vaccination clinics. This helped reduce the lack of compliance to around three per cent. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing. The CDCP warned: Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. 'If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.' Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The infection can lead to blindness and even death. Children aged one to four are most vulnerable. The CDPH warned medics to ask patients if they have either travelled to areas with a measles problem or locations domestically with a large number of foreign tourists from infected areas. The process of ensuring students are vaccinated is complicated because 60 different languages are spoken by students in the Spokane district, and about 30 percent of the students leave their school each year. Tracking vaccinations is especially difficult for students who come from out-of-state or other countries. At least 92 percent of the population of America is vaccinated. However, the number of children who are not vaccinated, is higher in some states, particularly in California where a number of cases are believed to have originated. The virus from Disneyland has so far infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to the theme park, health officials reported. It is believed to be linked to a similar outbreak in the Philippines. In California an estimated eight per cent of kindergartners\u00a0fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella. Some people choose not to get their children vaccinated for personal reasons, or it may be because their immune system is compromised. Children under one year old are not vaccinated because their bodies cannot cope with the vaccine. The issue of vaccination against measles is a historically controversial one. In a 1998 UK study the triple MMR vaccine was linked to autism, causing parents to panic and refuse to get their children vaccinated - leading to a rise in cases and resulting deaths and permanent injuries. However this paper by Andrew Wakefield was partially withdrawn from the Lancet in 2010 and fully retracted in 2014 after it was proven to be fraudulent. Wakefield was found guilty of serious  professional misconduct and was struck off the register. His claims have been disproved by a number of scientific studies. Last week Robert Kennedy Jr waded into a debate about proposals to remove the rights of parents to refuse to get their children vaccinated by comparing it to the holocaust. He claimed there was a link between autism and thimeresol, an ingredient in vaccines, and said:\u00a0'This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.' Multiple studies have rejected this link and this week Kennedy apologised for his comments.",

Competitive eater Mary Schuyler accomplished the stunning feat in front of hundreds at the Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday. Schuyler is such a champ that the four teams of two that competed against her didn't even come close to winning - even though they were allowed to split their dinners. Scroll down for video . Winner, winner, steak dinner: Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at the Big Texan Steack Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday . Fast eater: The 120-pound mother-of-four ate three steak dinners - complete with sides - in just 20 minutes . Worth it: For breaking the record for quickest steak dinner eaten and for finishing her three meals in under an hour, Schuyler took home a grand total of $6,000 . In addition to the three massive 72-ounce steaks, competitors also had to eat three baked potatoes, three shrimp cocktails, three salads and three rolls for a whopping 15 pounds of food. While that might sound daunting to most, Schuyler was confident that she would beat out the other competitors with her experience. 'They would have had to eat their half in like four minutes,' Schuyler told the Amarillo Globe-News. 'If you\u2019re not used to doing this, four minutes is hard.' Filling: The dinner included three 72-ounce steaks, three shrimp cocktails, three baked potatoes, three salads and three rolls . Champion: Though her competitors were allowed to tackle the challenge in teams of two, none came close to winning the competition . She cleaned her plate: Schuyler poses with a fan after the feat, showing off her belly bloated from the competition . However, she was a bit nervous about tackling a three steak dinners since she ate just two when she competed at the restaurant last year. 'I come in thinking I'm going to fail, but you know if I win it's a lovely parting gift and that's cool,' she told KFDA-TV. 'I also get free steak so I don't really lose.' As the competition began, Schuyler covered up with a pair of sunglasses and put up her sweatshirt hood to focus on the task at hand and finished her first steak in just four minutes and 18 seconds - beating the previous record she set last year of four minutes and 48 seconds. Hundreds cheered her on below the competition table set up side the restaurant on a sunny day, as Schuyler ripped her way through the steaks. Competitors had an hour to finish their $72 dinners, in order to get them for free, but Schuyler cleaned her plates in a cool 20. And with enough time to spare, Schuyler tried attacking a fourth steak but had to stop, saying she was tired of the taste. Schuyler was born and raised in Nebraska and currently residents in Sacramento California. Before her competitive food eating life, she worked as a bartender and server at Applebee\u2019s. In August 2012, Schuyler entered her first competitive eating competition, becoming the first woman to finish the Stellanator at Stella Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. The Stellanator includes six hamburger patties, six eggs, six pieces of cheese, six pieces of bacon topped with fried onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, two buns and mayonnaise. Another to add to the trophy cabinet: Schuyler pictured above winning the Z-Burger contest in Washington, DC last July. During the competition she ate 24 hamburgers in ten minutes . Since then, Schuyler has been competing regularly in food eating competitions - including one weekend in 2014 when she competed in FOUR food competitions. On January 31, 2014, Schuyler won Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia, by eating 363 wings. The next day, she competed in and won both the IHOP Pancake bowl and the bacon-eating contest at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines. She finished out the weekend by taking on the Adam Emmenecker Challenge at Jethro\u2019s Barbecue. Schuyler first took on the Emmenecker challenge in December 2012, when she became the first woman to complete the meal that includes a spicy pickle, bun, pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken tenders, white cheddar sauce, fried cheese cubes, Texas brisket, applewood smoked bacon, cheeseburger and a pound of waffle fries...in just 15 minutes. Dessert: Schuyler guzzles down\u00a012 pounds of rice pudding in three minutes to set a new world record last year . Hero: Last year Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland, Oregon . Schuyler started the competition at her normal 120 pounds, but by the time she was crowned winner, she had gained 15 pounds and her stomach noticeably filled out. Her physique was quite a contrast to the larger men who decided to take her on in the eating competition including a team of two professional wrestlers and two members of the Amarillo Venum indoor football team. For setting the record for fastest eaten steak dinner, Schuyler won $1,000 and another $5,000 for completing the challenge in less than an hour. What's more - Schuyler says she plans to come back next year and break her record, upping the ante to four steaks instead of three. Bobby Lee, the co-owner of the Big Texas, says the restaurant was floored by her performance and that they'll be submitting her record to Guinness. 'We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time- so this is a first for us and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal,' Lee told ABC 7. Schuyler started competing in eating competition in August 2012, and has broken several records during her brief career. In January 2014, she set ate 363 wings in just 20 minutes, earning $22,000 prize for that competition.",

On the show hapless character Rachel decided to treat her loved ones to what she mistakenly thought was 'a traditional English trifle' layered with all the trimmings - including\u00a0ladyfingers, jam, custard, beef saut\u00e9ed with peas and onions, a little more custard, bananas and some whipped cream. Now one brave Mancunian has whipped up their own version of the unusual concoction - replacing the beef with the far more traditional lamb. Scroll down for video . Neil Killham made the infamous shepherds pie-trifle combination immortalised on Friends 16 years ago. It features sponge, jam, custard, lamb, peas, onions, whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles . Neil Killham, a 32-year-old software engineer from Manchester, announced his plans on Twitter with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption: 'It's finally time. I'm making The Trifle Out Of Friends.' Giving a running commentary on the social media site, Neil proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it. He told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still 'f****** horrible'. He added: 'But with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it.' The trifle-shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into . Friends character Rachel Green (played by Jennifer Aniston) accidentally made the disgusting dessert . Neil posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it doesn't appear to have improved . 'I thought I'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours, but I cannot.' When MailOnline asked how it tasted, Neil, who shared the dish with friends, said: 'It tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that I couldn't finish my slice. 'It's the way you sometimes think you've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow! Lamb!' He said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes, a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza, among other things. 'Usually they kind of work, so I figured it was time to try something that definitely wouldn't,' he said. 'Although when I tried sprouts in marmite that didn't work either, but it wasn't as bad as this. 'A couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible.\u00a0Opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem. 'Then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions. 'Except for one guy who said \"it wasn't that bad really. Not good, but not the worst\". 'I'm not sure I can trust him any more.' The trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse . In the show the dessert was described as half trifle, half shepherd's pie after two pages in the English cookery book Rachel was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie. Towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and Rachel says: 'I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!' If for some reason you would like to recreate this Heston Blumenthal-esque clash of flavours and textures, the recipe would appear to be: A layer of sponge, layer of jam, layer of custard, layer of raspberries, another layer of sponge, layer of lamb saut\u00e9ed with peas and onions, a bit more custard, banana, and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands .",

The side, which is voted for by players from across the 20 clubs in England\u2019s top flight, featured six Chelsea players, with Eden Hazard, winner of the individual prize, making the side for the third straight season. But did the professionals get it right? Not according to the EA Sports\u2019 Performance Index anyway. Sergio Aguero nets his 21st strike of the season against Aston Villa. He has scored one more than Harry Kane . Cesc Fabregas, in action against his former club Arsenal on Sunday, and Aguero are in the EA Sports Team . Eden Hazard poses with his individual gong at Sunday's night's PFA Player of the Year awards in London . The system, which measures a player's contribution to the success of his team, sees Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Aguero, scorer of 21 goals this term, replace  Diego Costa up front. Aguero is one of five changes from the PFA Team of the Year.\u00a0The EA Sports\u2019 side sees two fewer Chelsea players in the line-up with Gary Cahill and Nemanja Matic failing to make the team. Instead Everton defender Phil Jagielka, who has missed just one Premier League game, and Santi Cazorla, one of Arsenal's standout players, are given the nod. The EA Sports Team of the Year (left) and the PFA Team of the Year award, which was announced on Sunday . Cesc Fabregas, a surprise omission from the PFA Player of the Team is included in the EA Sports XI. The Spaniard, who returned to Arsenal for the first time since leaving the Emirates Stadium to join Barcelona in the summer of 2011, has provided assists for 17 goals for Chelsea following his \u00a330million arrival from the Nou Camp - the most of any player in the division. Aaron Cresswell beats Ryan Bertrand to fill the left-back slot after impressing for West Ham. Along with David de Gea, the 25-year-old Hammers defender is the only man to have played every minute of the campaign. John Terry, named in both  line-ups, has started each of Chelsea\u2019s 33 matches, but hasn\u2019t completed every one. The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses.\u00a0So, what are the six indices? 1.\u00a0Winning performance . 2.

Arsenal were unable to break down their opponents in an attritional game, while Jose Mourinho's side rarely troubled David Ospina. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his verdict from the Emirates Stadium... Arsenal . David Ospina - Lucky not concede a penalty after clattering into Oscar - but produced a good stop to deny Ramires. 6.5 . Hector Bellerin - The youngster was preferred to fit again Mathieu Debuchy and justified his manager's faith. 7 . David Ospina was fortunate to get away without conceding a penalty when he clattered Oscar . Hector Bellerin does well to clear the ball off the line to prevent Oscar's lob putting Chelsea ahead . Laurent Koscielny - Cruised through the first half owing to Chelsea playing with no striker. Had more to think about following's Drogba's introduction. 7 . Per Mertesacker - Patched up after sustaining an ankle injury last weekend. Showed little sign of the problem in a strong performance. 7.5 . Nacho Monreal - Steady game for the Spaniard. Looks to be edging ahead of Kieran Gibbs for position as No 1 left-back. Booked. 6.5 . Francis Coquelin - Had to walk a disciplinary tightrope after a first-half booking - but remained industrious as ever.7 . Francis Coquelin breaks up a Chelsea attack but his holding role was made more difficult by a booking . Santi Cazorla - He's had more influential days, but kept Arsenal's midfield ticking over. Booked. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey - Utilised, once again, in an unfamiliar right-wing role. It didn't throw him off his stride too much. Booked. 6.5 . Mesut Ozil - Not quite \u00a342.5million, but he's getting there. Heavily involved for the Gunners but couldn't find a breakthrough. 7 . Alexis Sanchez - Fresh from his Wembley double, the Chilean wasn't quite at his best against Chelsea. 6.5 . Olivier Giroud - Endured a titanic battle with Terry. The Frenchman put himself about against the champions-elect. 6.5 . Olivier Giroud shields the ball from a masked Cesc Fabregas, but the Frenchman had little joy up front . Subs: . Danny Welbeck (on for Coquelin, 76) - Injected pace into Arsenal's attack. 6.5 . Theo Walcott (on for Giroud, 84) - Thrown on late as the Gunners searched for victory. 6.5 . Subs not used: Szczesny, Debuchy, Gibbs, Wilshere, Flamini . Manager: Arsene Wenger - His Mourinho hoodoo continues - but the French manager can be happy with his side. 6. Chelsea . Thibault Courtois - Made some routine saves but has had much more eye-catching afternoons. 6.5 . Branislav Ivanovic - Solid and steady as ever from the Blues right-back. Excellent tussle with Sanchez. Booked. 7 . Gary Cahill - A mature display from the England central-defender. Kept his cool in the heat of battle. 7.5 . John Terry - Played a crucial role in quelling Giroud's aerial threat. A typical all-action display from the Chelsea skipper. 8 . John Terry and Gary Cahill did well to prevent Giroud from becoming a threat as Chelsea kept things tight . Cesar Azpilicueta - Been one of Chelsea's most consistent players this season. Was so again at the Emirates. 7.5 . Nemanja Matic - Shielded his back-four with the expertise we've come to expect. Didn't put a foot wrong. 7 . Cesc Fabregas - Booed on his return to Emirates and booked for diving. Wasn't how he'd dreamed it last night. 6 . Ramires - Missed a glorious chance to put Chelsea ahead in the first half. Defensive instincts were vital for Chelsea. 6.5 . Ramires carries the ball past Arsenal left back Nacho Monreal in the top of the table clash . Willian - A willing runner in attack and defence for the Blues. Showed some quality on ball, too. Booked. 6.5 . Eden Hazard - He's had more productive days, but his defensive discipline was important for the visitors. 6 . Oscar - Playing in an unfamiliar role as central striker, he should have won Chelsea a penalty. Did little much else. 6 . Eden Hazard was unusually quiet, with Arsenal keeping a close eye on him, but still showed flashes of quality . Subs: . Didier Drogba (on for Oscar, 46) - So often Arsenal's tormentor. Could replicate past heroics. 6 . Kurt Zouma (on for Fabregas, 90) - Brought on to see out the final few minutes. 6 . Juan Cuadrado (on for Willian, 90) - Came on for the final few seconds. 6 . Manager: Jose Mourinho - Starting with no striker said it all. Came for a point - and got it. Job done. 7 . Referee: Michael Oliver - Could easily have awarded three penalties on busy afternoon four the official. 6.5 . Oscar had to be replaced at half time after a suspected concussion after his clash with Ospina .",

The body his wife, Palak Bhadreskumar Patel, (right) was found on April 12 . Patrons called police April 12 shortly after discovering no workers at the Dunkin' Donuts on Arundel Mills Boulevard in Hanover. According to Anne Arundel County Police, an officer checked the business and found a severely injured woman in the kitchen area. The woman, Patel's wife, died at the scene. Anne Arundel County police said an officer responded around 10:51pm. 'The female employee of Dunkin Donuts was the victim of an apparent homicide,' the release said. 'This is not a random crime as the victim and suspect were known to each other,' authorities said in the news release. Authorities said that Patel had been charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, first-degree assault, second-degree assault, as well as dangerous weapon with intent to injure. Police said the investigation revealed that Patel's husband hit her in the face with a kitchen knife and then fled. A taxi driver told investigators that she picked up Patel on April 12 across from the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and drove him to a Best Western in Newark, New Jersey, approximately 185 miles away, according to WTOP. Patel was last seen on surveillance footage at a Best Western in Newark, New Jersey, near the Newark Liberty International Airport on April 13.\u00a0Investigators believe he fled Maryland to New Jersey to escape state charges . Investigators believe he fled to New Jersey to escape state charges, but they believe he is still in the United States. They have no evidence that he boarded plane and the FBI put a hold on Patel\u2019s passport, preventing him from crossing the border. Patel was born in India and was in the United States legally on a visa, but his visa expired at the end of March, according to the FBI. The FBI plans to put up billboards to help locate Patel, who is described as weighing approximately 165lb and 5ft 9in tall with brown eyes and hair. According to authorities, Patel is considered to be dangerous. Both Patel and his wife worked at the Dunkin' Donuts in Hanover, Maryland, where the wife's body was found . One of the store's frequent customers, Idrisa Wurie, told the Capital Gazette 'Oh my goodness. I am shocked because they are very nice people.' A police spokesperson told the Gazette police dealt with the couple in the past year regarding a domestic incident. In a statement, Dunkin' Donuts said 'We are aware of the tragic incident that occurred at the Dunkin' Donuts / Baskin-Robbins combination restaurant on Arundel Mills Boulevard in Hanover, Maryland. 'All of us at Dunkin' Brands are saddened to learn of the death of crew member Palak Bhadreskumar Patel, and our thoughts go out to her family and friends. 'The franchise owner is cooperating fully with the local authorities in their investigation. As this is a pending police matter, it is inappropriate for us to comment further.' Police have said tips can be called into to 410-222-474 and anonymously at 410-222-4700.",

It all started with a birthday party that little Damani Terry was attending. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. The distraught driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy. But it was too late, police said. Damani was dead. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. That was not the end of the situation. Soon, two more people would also die: the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man, police said. That man, identified as Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, was located late Wednesday at a Chicago-area hotel. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. \"Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm,\" the police chief said Thursday. An accidental death, a fatal retaliation rips apart two families . Damani's family members had previously identified the shooting suspect as the boys' uncle. \"Sunday was the worst day I ever lived in my whole entire life,\" Lena Tidwell, told CNN affiliate WISN. \"It's a day I wish had never, never came.\" Tidwell is the boys' grandmother and the mother of the alleged gunman. She said she was inside eating cake and ice cream at the birthday when her life turned upside down. \"I didn't know my grandbaby got hit, and then I heard people just screaming,\" she said. \"Then I just heard gunshots, and my daughter ran in the house with the baby in her arms.\" The family believes the uncle targeted Brown, and Rasheed was struck by an errant bullet. \"I heard he was trying to pick his brother up. He was trying to hold him and save him,\" a family friend, Stephanie Townsend, told CNN affiliate WITI. Earlier this week, Flynn bemoaned the apparent madness of what happened. \"What did we have Sunday?\" Flynn asked. \"We had some clown take the law into his own hands and murder a guy who was doing what we expect good citizens to do, and oops, accidentally kill somebody else.\"",

A fourth person has been arrested over the alleged murder of a Syrian imam who was shot dead in his car on a London street. Police announced today that they had arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Abdul Hadi Arwani, who was killed in Wembley two weeks ago. A Jamaican businessman has already appeared in court charged with Mr Arwani's murder, while a man and a woman were arrested this week on suspicion of terror offences. The father of six, who was an imam at a controversial mosque in west London, was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat on April 7. Leslie Cooper, 36, appeared at the Old Bailey on Thursday, where the court was told that Mr Arwani, 48, was lured to a meeting with a potential customer for his construction business before being killed. Burnell Mitchell, 61, the brother of Boney M's lead singer, was arrested this week on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. A 53-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are both in Metropolitan Police custody while counter-terror officers continue to investigate Mr Arwani's killing. Police said in a statement today that they had arrested the fourth suspect, a 35-year-old man, on Friday, before releasing him on bail today. Suspects: Leslie Cooper, left, appeared in court charged with murder while Burnell Mitchell, right, has been arrested on suspicion of terror offences . Mr Arwani was previously a preacher at the An-Noor mosque in Acton but resigned after he apparently fell out with other community leaders. The mosque was founded by Mr Mitchell 20 years ago after he converted to Islam, and he remains a trustee of the centre as well as a director of the company which owns its premises. Mr Mitchell, whose sister Liz Mitchell was the lead singer of Boney M, was brought up a strict Christian before changing faith and becoming known as 'Khalid Rashad'. Both his home and the mosque were searched by police last week as part of the investigation into Mr Arwani's death. Mosque: Police standing outside the An-Noor cultural centre in Acton earlier this week . The Syrian-born imam fled his home country in the 1980s and became an outspoken opponent of president Bashar al-Assad's regime before his killing. Mr Arwani's son Murhaf said last week: 'He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it.

Scroll down for video . What a square! A dog shows off Taiwan's bizarre new pet-grooming trend after having his fur cut in a square . Hairdresser Tain Yeh, 42, who runs a parlour in Taipei said: 'I am aware of the trend although we don't have much request for it here because it's very difficult to keep the shape. 'It came about because people were always looking for more impressive haircuts, and somebody came up with the idea of shaping the dog like a hedge.' Pictures of doe-eyed dogs with their shapely new cuts have proved extremely popular online prompting more owners to seek out the custom salons. Many are now opting for the cuts simply to get more likes and shares on social media sites. Ms Yeh added: 'The dogs don't mind, and the owners keep coming back for more. This sort of haircut needs a lot more maintenance then the regular type. 'It is also not suitable for all breeds. The dog needs to have plenty of hair to play around with so that you can shape it around the face and body.' Willing customers? Two more recently-groomed pooches stare sad-eyed into the camera as they show off new hairstyles .

Justin Jackson, a Florida man, has been carrying out the bizarre schemes in the hope of cashing in on the freebies, or winning himself a job in luxurious hotels, according to court documents. Jackson is being sued by Oprah's TV network as well as Love - the college basketball star who went on to be the President's personal assistant. 'Con man': Justin Jackson, right, has been accused of pretending to be a host of celebrity-linked characters in order to score freebies and jobs. Angel Agarrat, left, is also named in a Florida lawsuit attempting to get the pair to stop posing as other people . Legal papers filed in a south Florida federal court describe Jackson waging an eight-year trail of deceit in which he variously posed as Oprah herself, Oprah's nephew, Love, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), and managers of Madonna and Johnny Depp. The earliest fraud, the papers said, saw Jackson trick a New York City jeweler into lending him items worth $2.4million by pretending to be Madonna's manager. He contacted a store in July 2007 and said she needed the lavish items for a photoshoot, the papers said. When he got the items, he reportedly sold them to another jeweler and fled. The court papers say he was convicted for grand theft over the ruse, but later dreamed up new celebrity-linked schemes. The latest claims say Jackson pretended to be Oprah and her representatives in the hope of getting more freebies - and even posed as the famous talk show host to recommend him for jobs. He allegedly sent letters on forged OWN stationery to \u00a0five different hotel groups with locations in Florida, recommending himself for work at the locations. 'Impersonator': Jackson (right) is accused of sending messages purporting to be former Obama aide Reggie Love (left), whom he said worked for Oprah. The right-hand photograph, court papers claim, was emailed from an email account allegedly belonging to Johnny Depp's manager, asking for tickets to see Oprah . The papers claim some of the notes purportedly to be directly from Oprah, while others claimed to be from Love, who was signed off as the star's 'executive assistant and personal aide'. Also named in the claims was Angel Agarrat, whom lawyers claim was also involved in the deception, and was subject of some of the bogus letters of recommendation for jobs. In one of the exchanges, Jackson allegedly suggested that if he and Agarrat were to be given work at the hotels, Oprah would make a personal appearance there. One letter even claimed Jackson was Oprah's nephew. Love has never worked for Oprah. Other schemes allegedly saw Jackson write to four different jewelry companies, as well as a clothe retailer, to get free goods allegedly meant for Oprah. Scheme: According to the claims, Jackson signed some emails off as Oprah, left, and others as Scott Garner, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The claims date from around September 2013 to the end of 2014. The documents also say Jackson has a history of pretending to be Love, and had tried in 2010 to trade off Love's own name to get free designer clothes, handbags and Cheesecake Factory vouchers. In a final case, Jackson . OWN, Love and Scott Garner, an executive at Oprah's company whose name was used, filed a joint suit against Jackson and Agarrat this week. It accuses the two of invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names, infringing trademarks and conspiracy. The documents ask that a judge files an injunction to stop the two using any of the false names, and also stakes a claim for financial damages. Although no figures are specified, arguments in the court papers imply that the figure will be at least $75,000.",

Six people, including one civilian, were killed when a car bomb exploded near the police station in Al-Arish, capital of North Sinai, Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghafar told Ahram Online. He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported. Among those being replaced are the generals in charge of military intelligence and Egypt's second field army, which is spearheading the battle against the insurgents in the northern Sinai. Egypt's army has been fighting a decade-long militant Islamist insurgency, which has spiked since the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsy in the summer of 2013. Hundreds of police and soldiers, as well as civilians, have been killed in militant attacks in the past months. Ian Lee reported from Cairo. Anas Hamdan reported from Atlanta.",

The original group of 105 people left Libya on Tuesday in a rubber boat. Sometime during the trip north across the Mediterranean Sea, the alleged assailants -- Muslims from the Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal -- threw the 12 overboard, police said. Other people on the voyage told police that they themselves were spared \"because they strongly opposed the drowning attempt and formed a human chain,\" Palermo police said. The boat was intercepted by an Italian navy vessel, which transferred the passengers to a Panamanian-flagged ship. That ship docked in Palermo on Wednesday, after which the arrests were made, police said. 'I enter Europe or I die': Desperate migrants rescued this week off Italy . The 12 who died were from Nigeria and Ghana, police said. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, often aboard vessels poorly equipped for the trip. Many of them attempt the voyage to flee war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. More than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian coast guard. Many die each year while attempting the voyage, often when boats capsized. Last year at least 3,200 died trying to make the trip. Since 2000, according to the International Organization for Migration, almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean.

Steelcase's the Brody WorkLounge is an effort to preserve the privacy and less distractions given in a cubicle while still being a part of an open office work community. On its company website, Steelcase said the Brody is designed to be 'good for your body and good for your brain'. Scroll down for video . Office furniture company Steelcase designed the work space seating to provide privacy in an open office setting (above designs of the Brody WorkLounge) The seating will be available for purchase in late August starting at $2,700 . Brody features an LED task light, privacy screen, foot rest, storage space and personal adjustable work surface . The Brody, which will be available\u00a0late August starting at $2,700, sort of resembles both a desk and an office and is created to limit distractions by creating a shelter while also providing privacy, according to the company. The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive - informed the design of Brody, according to\u00a0CityLab. 'We had kind of an intuitive understanding of how people liked to study,' Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase\u00a0told Fast Company. 'As the project developed, and as we started diving into what it means to focus and why someone would want to escape, these new findings really helped guide the project.' 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security,' the company said on its website . The design for Brody is based on\u00a0The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration where workers are their most productive . In the U.S., 70 per cent of offices have low or no partitions as they embrace open office plans . Each WorkLounge features a mini LED task light, a power outlet, personal work surface that adjusts up to a 40 degree pitch, a privacy screen, a side surface which also serves as an armrest, patented LiveLumbar technology which gives back support, personal storage off of the floor, a foot rest, and a cushion that adapts to each person's size. 'The ability to focus is a real challenge for today's workers and students,' the company said on its website. 'We get interrupted or distracted every 11 minutes and it takes over 23 minutes to get back on task. 'The Brody WorkLounge creates a shelter from visual distractions, provides privacy and provides an enhanced sense of psychological security.' By transforming the under-utilized in-between spaces into these modern alternative to enclaves, where workers can get away for a couple of hours, Steelcase claims its design will help organizations and universities by delivering a 'high-performance work space'. A study revealed that a sense of privacy boosts performance, and Brody WorkLounge strives to provide workers with limited visual distractions . Mark McKenna, director of product design at Steelcase said: 'I think it's clear that people in an office need a place to focus. But the bench is here to stay. It's conducive to collaboration' In recent years, many companies have embraced open offices with about 70 per cent of U.S. offices having no or low partitions, according to the International Facility Management Association. However, a 2013 study revealed that workers are frustrated by the distractions in open offices which lead to poorer work performance, according to the Washington Post. That study also found that nearly half of the surveyed workers in open offices said the lack of sound privacy proved to be a problem for them while more than 30 per cent complained about the lack of visual privacy. Another study\u00a0revealed that having a sense of privacy actually boosts performance. While Brody is not a stance against open offices, it provides a place for people to focus while in an office, McKenna told Fast Company. 'I think it's clear that people in an office need a place to focus,' McKenna said. 'But the bench is here to stay. It's conducive to collaboration.'",

The former Manchester United defender believes his former club, Chelsea and Arsenal would be a preferable option now for a big star looking to switch to the Premier League. Neville wrote in his Telegraph column that should a player such as Paul Pogba or Mats Hummels decide on a move to England, they are unlikely to select the Etihad as their destination - now that Manuel Pellegrini's side have been reined in by Financial Fair Play. Gary Neville believes Manchester City would now struggle to attract top players thanks to financial restrictions . Players such as Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels (left) and Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba would prefer to go to one of Manchester City's Premier League rivals, according to Neville . Neville believes Manchester City need to be bold and take on UEFA's FFP regulations . 'Unless City are bold and decide to take on Uefa\u2019s Financial Fair Play regulations, they will find it difficult to compete with United, Chelsea and Arsenal for the players I believe could make the difference in next season\u2019s title race,' said Neville. 'If any of the top four is able to add Gareth Bale, Morgan Schneiderlin and/or Paul Pogba and Mats Hummels to their squad this summer, they would instantly become front-runners to win the Premier League next year. 'There will be an intense fight between all of the top four clubs to secure the best players, but if that battle takes place on an even playing field, I don\u2019t see how City can come out on top. 'The landscape has changed since City were able to blow everybody out of the water by paying big fees and big wages to sign the likes of Carlos Tevez, Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri.' Manchester City have previously manager to attract the likes of Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez . Manchester United had to blitz the market and sign the likes of Angel di Maria last summer . He added: 'FFP has reined City back in and United and Arsenal have upped the ante by spending big themselves and raising the ceiling of their pay structures. 'When United were faced with the Doomsday scenario of being out of the Champions League last summer, they had to blitz the market to sign the likes of Angel di Maria, simply because they had to throw money at the problem they found themselves in. 'And that is big issue facing City this summer -- United, Chelsea and Arsenal are now all capable of taking them on in the transfer market and, if a player has a straight choice between the four clubs, City will come fourth every time.' Manchester City  travel to Old Trafford to face United in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon. Pellegrini's side sit a point and a place behind their cross-town rivals in fourth.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia. In a documentary aired today  on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying. Putin also expressed his fears that the West wishes Russia harm as he recalled how some world leaders told him they would not mind Russia's possible disintegration. 'My counterparts, a lot of presidents and prime ministers told me later on that they had decided for themselves by then that Russia would cease to exist in its current form,' he said. 'The only question was when it happens and what consequences would be.'",

Or how a hotel handles it if a guest dies during their stay? Hotel industry insider turned author Jacob Tomsky shares his tales from working in two top hotels in New Orleans and New York City and provides lots of little-known tips to ensure guests make the most of every hotel stay. MailOnline Travel chatted with Tomsky to get the answers to some of our most burning hotel questions... Scroll down for video . Hotel industry insider turned author, Jacob Tomsky, reveals the most common items people take from hotels . What are some of the most common items that people take from hotels? Without a doubt, toiletries and towels are definitely the most popular items for guests to pocket, according to Jacob Tomsky, author of Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality. But some individuals staying at the hotel take things a bit too far. 'They take everything,' he tells MailOnline Travel. 'Duvet covers, little silver trashcans, universal remotes - anything that's not nailed down.' Despite common misconceptions, it is possible to pocket a plush robe - without incurring any charges . What can you usually get away with taking? Despite common misconceptions, you actually can get away with stealing that coveted hotel room robe. 'If you were to, say, check into a room, take a fresh robe and pack it away in your suitcase, then call down and say your room didn't have a robe in it when you checked in, is the hotel staff going to search your belongings? Highly unlikely,' Tomsky reveals. And when it comes to pocketing toiletries, you can occasionally even ask for more. 'There are other items, as well - complimentary amenities that you may not be aware are available,' he explains. 'Good hotels keep extra items, such as slippers, razors and shaving cream, travel lint rollers, and mini-deodorants, in stock but not displayed in the room.' As it turns out, the minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel, full of items 'sold at an absurd mark-up' If you lie about using the minibar, will the hotel really charge you? 'The minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel,' Tomsky tells MailOnline Travel. 'Human error, over-stocking, failure to re-stock, errant charges from weighted items being shifted but not consumed, all of these lead the front desk to spend hours a day slicing off incorrect charges.' He also notes that the 'items are purchased in bulk and sold at an absurd mark-up.' 'Hotels are much more concerned with your overall experience and securing further room nights - the main revenue stream - than whether or not you ate a candy bar.' Mike Holovacs, a front office supervisor at a major hotel chain and an adjunct hospitality instructor, adds: 'If an item has not sold, it's just like any other retail setting - the item is pulled when it reaches its expiration date.' Because certain rooms have varying levels of cleaning difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' How long does it take to clean a hotel room? Is there anything that typically does not get cleaned? The length of cleaning time generally depends on the room. Because rooms have varying levels of difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' and housekeepers must clean a certain total of points in one day. This may translate to a few larger suites or simply multiple standard rooms. 'I'd guess the average time is between 30 minutes to an hour to flip the room,' Tomsky estimates. 'A great deal of that time discrepancy depends on how the guest has left the room.' Once a year, large sections of rooms, or even entire floors are pulled out of service for maintenance and deep cleaning. 'This is includes sending the draperies out for cleaning and shampooing the carpets,' Holovacs explains. However, minibar glasses are often cleaned less thoroughly, usually soaked in shampoo or furniture polish . When it comes to the items that are cleaned less frequently or less thoroughly? Minibar glasses and the remote control. 'Housekeepers are usually responsible for cleaning the glasses, yet are not provided with dish soap,' he explains. 'So they either soak them in the sink with shampoo or, in a pinch, use furniture polish, as it leaves a 'clean-looking' shine.' And have you ever tried to clean your own remote? 'The rubbery buttons make it near impossible and dousing it with a cleaning agent could damage the circuitry,' Tomsky adds. How much money hotels spend on toiletries generally depends on the scale of the property and its occupancy . How much do hotels generally spend on toiletries per year? This one has everything to do with the scale of the property and its occupancy. According to a recent Forbes\u00a0article, the Marriott hotel chain will spend approximately $20 million annually on their Thann products, a natural skincare line that's stocked in their Americas and Asia Pacific hotels. 'Usually the ordering is done by a housekeeping manager who takes into account the current supply and the average monthly uses from years past,' Tomsky reveals. 'People use more toiletries in the winter, have longer showers, and go through more toilet paper. 'It's a rather intriguing ordering process based on a large amount of collected data. 'And, ultimately, you don't want to be the one who fails to order enough toilet paper for the entire hotel.' Though there's a belief that hotel staffer furnish their home with amenities, Tomsky says it's not often the case . And do staff ever get to take them home? 'There's a long history of hotel staffers semi-furnishing their own home with hotel amenities,' Tomsky admits. 'Every party I threw from 2001 to 2004 was catered with hotel pillow chocolates. 'For the most part, items are either so pre-used that to take them would be distasteful, or so expensive that to steal them wouldn't be worth the loss of one's job. 'But I do have shoe polish that I've never paid for and hotel-branded slippers to keep me comfy in the wintertime.' One charity has come up with a novel way to deal with leftover hotel soaps - churning them together to provide soap to those in developing countries. Clean The World, receives partially-used and discarded soap from hotels, recycles it into millions of new bars, and then works with partner Global Soap to strategically distribute the new soap to people who lack access to it around the world. People dying in their hotel room is not quite as rare of an occurrence as guests may think, Tomsky admits . What happens if someone dies in a hotel room? While a bit morbid to talk about, Tomsky admits that such an occurrence is not quite as rare as guests may think. 'It's not something a hotel wishes to publicise, naturally,' he explains. 'So, they are removed as discreetly as possible. 'This may involve flashing lights and paramedics, depending on the severity of the situation, but can also happen via employee elevators and back exits.' Afterwards, the room is sanitised, cleaned, 'flipped' and sold - and that can happen a lot faster than you'd think. And, of course, all hotel staffers are forbidden from revealing any details - including cause of death and room numbers - to anyone. 'Death is a part of hotel life,' Tomsky adds. 'In fact, suicides often prefer hotels, relieving loved ones of the cleaning duties or seeing the deceased in a disturbing way.' Guests should take comfort in knowing that their in-room safes are actually very secure . Do staff actually have access to the in-room safes? No, they do not. The safes truly are, you know, safe. 'I always recommend using the safe to every traveller,' Tomsky says. 'The only person who can open the safe, should you forget your password, is a manager from the security department, using a tool that only they are trained and authorised to use.' What really happens to that half-used roll of loo paper in hotel room bathrooms? Well, it depends... And finally, what happens to the half-used loo roll in hotel room bathrooms? There's a bit of dispute over this one, and again, a lot of times it depends on the hotel itself. In the spirit of being environmentally-minded, most chains will simply refold the paper and leave the half-used roll in the bathroom, with another full roll behind it, should the guest run out. If there's not enough left to warrant leaving it, a Quora thread user, who works for the Beechmont Hotels Corporation, believes that the nearly-used up roll most likely winds up on housekeeping carts for when a room attendant needs a tissue for other cleaning tasks or in employee bathrooms.",

Court records show he was $7,500 behind on child support when he was pulled over on Saturday and had already been jailed three times for missing payments. His family believe the fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during the deadly traffic stop. But there was nothing directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge, despite the fact his last payment was only in 2012. Scroll down for video . Escape: Dashcam footage released on Thursday shows Walter Scott running away from his car minutes before he is shot dead by Officer Michael Sager. His family believed he fled over fears he would be arrested for being behind on child support payments . History: Scott had already been jailed three times over missed payments, but court records have revealed there was no warrant out for his arrest when he was pulled over. Minutes later he was shot dead . In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. On Thursday a police dashboard camera video released Thursday shows Scott bolting from his Mercedes after he pulled over. The camera on Slager's patrol car captures him telling Scott his third brake light is broken, before asking him to produce insurance papers. Scott, who appears to be accompanied by a person in the passenger seat, explains he does not have any documents as he has yet to officially buy the car. 'I haven't bought it yet, I'm about to do that Monday.... My car is down,' he says. The officer appears calm, checks his licence, then tells him: 'I'll be right back with you.' When Slager returns to his vehicle, Scott flees, running towards the park where he would die moments later. Off camera, a scuffle can be heard, with shouts of 'Taser, Taser, Taser!' and 'Get on the ground!' Slager's account has been called into question after a shocking video taken by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back. In the dash cam footage, captured from Slager's patrol car, the officer explains, 'The reason I've pulled you over is because your third brakelight is out.' The conversation is muffled, with music playing in Slager's car obscuring the sound. Horrifying: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . He can be heard asking Scott for his licence, registration and insurance card. Scott responds that he doesn't have papers as he has not yet to bought the car. 'Alright let me see your licence,' Slager replies. 'So you don't have any papers in the glove pocket?' Scott repeats that he does not and he is paying for the car on Monday. Slager returns to his car. A minute later, Scott opens the door, and gestures to Slager, who shouts, 'you've got to stay in the car!' Scott then sits back inside the car - and moments later flees. The only other footage of the incident shows the moment Scott was shot. Released earlier this week, it begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.",

State authorities were suspicious that the 88-year-old author, who is reportedly deaf and blind, was somehow pushed into publishing the forthcoming Go Set a Watchman, and launched two investigations into the circumstances surrounding the launch. Many feared outside influences were at play as Lee, who lives in an nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, had said for decades she wanted To Kill a Mockingbird to be her only published novel. Scroll down for video . Of sound mind: Investigators concluded that Harper Lee, pictured above in 2009, is in a fit state to make decisions about the future of the forthcoming novel Go Set a Watchman . Officials at the state's Department of Human Resources confirmed Monday that their investigation had been completely closed. Earlier Alabama's Securities Commission had sent an investigator\u00a0to speak with her, and said that she answered their questions well enough to convince them she made her own decision, and knew what was happening with her book. The DHR investigation remained open for a time, but spokesman Barry Spear has confirmed that they are now also satisfied that nothing is amiss. Earlier suspicions had in part been fired by the fact that Lee's attorneys had announced the release, due in July, and that publishing house HarperCollins had not had any direct contact with her. Elderly: Lee lives in this nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, and has reportedly been deaf and blind since 2007 . Bobby Segall, a lawyer representing Lee's attorney Tonja Carter, confirmed Monday that they received a letter saying that DHR was closing the investigation with no findings. HarperCollins has announced a July 14 release date for Go Set a Watchman, and will print an initial run of 2million copies. The book is high on Amazon's best-seller list despite some concerns about the novel, which Lee wrote before To Kill A Mockingbird. Lee had long expressed that she's happy to have 1960's Mockingbird' - which won a Pulitzer, was adapted into a movie and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide - as her only published book. Go Set a Watchman, a 304-page novel, is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, although Lee actually wrote it in the mid-1950s, before Mockingbird. Old and new: Go Set a Watchman is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird - though Lee actually wrote it before the best-selling novel which secured her reputation . The new novel will feature Scout, Mockigbird's protagonist, as an adult woman returning to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City 20 years after the events of To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee thought she had lost the novel's manuscript - but her attorney Tonja Carter found it recently. A statement from Lee, released by HarperCollins, said: 'In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman. 'It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout. 'I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. Not happy to see him: Reporter Connor Sheets received this blunt, handwritten 'Go away!' from Harper Lee when he asked her repeatedly for an interview . 'After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.' According to publisher Harper, Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird.' Lee has refused to comment further on the novel, helping fire suspicions about her mental state. One Alabamian reporter who tried for two weeks to secure an interview was eventually rewarded with a hand-written note. It read: 'Go away! Harper Lee.'",

But Kai Windsor started life as a girl \u2013 and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body. Christened Kaia, he would shun traditional girls\u2019 toys in favour of kicking a ball around. By four, he refused to wear dresses \u2013 and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls. By nine, he had finally broken the truth to his mother Rachel, 37, telling her: \u2018I\u2019m really a boy.\u2019 Now, at the age of ten, Kai is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman. Miss Windsor, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: \u2018As a toddler, Kai only wanted to play ball. As a girl, he had no interest in any dolls and made a beeline for boy\u2019s toys. \u2018And as soon as he began school, he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did. Soon after, I noticed he went red whenever girls were around.\u2019 Kai is not alone in facing gender problems. The number of transgender referrals to the NHS for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009. Like many parents in her situation, Miss Windsor had never heard of children facing such issues. But the single mother, who runs a health juice business, said Kai had \u2018amazing support\u2019 from his primary school. He was given counselling when his schoolwork started to suffer, and later decided to confront the issue head-on. \u2018They were the ones who suggested Kai should have counselling,\u2019 she said. \u2018Then when he came out as transgender, they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy. \u2018Staff then held a special lesson for all the year to explain about being transgender. And now they are even in the process of building unisex toilets to make life easier for Kai and other children like him.\u2019 Kaia pretty in pink, aged four, pictured left, and dressing up as a pirate, at five, pictured right . When Kai was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female. Miss Windsor, who also has a daughter Jasmine, 16, from a previous relationship, said: \u2018As a toddler I usually put Kaia in dresses and bought her lots of dolls. Meanwhile, as her blonde hair grew, I put in pigtails. It simply never occurred to me she wouldn\u2019t be as feminine as her sister.\u2019 She added: \u2018Looking back Kai knew then he was a boy. He had no interest in dolls, preferring to play with a football. And when we were out he\u2019d head straight for the boy\u2019s section in shops, asking for Spiderman toys.\u2019 At seven, Kai wanted his hair cut shorter. But his grades started suffering and he was later given counselling at school. Within a few weeks, his behaviour and schoolwork improved and last year he officially became transgender after telling his mother one morning. Transgender Kai is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment . Meanwhile, his grades immediately improved. \u2018Once people stopped referring to Kai as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted, he was so much happier,\u2019 she said. Kai is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty. If at the age of 16, he wants to complete the full transition to an adult man, he will be offered gender reassignment surgery. Miss Windsor added: \u2018There have been plenty of tears. It is hard to see your child going through such turmoil. But whatever happens I will always be there to support Kai. \u2018And right now it is just a wonderful relief to see him happy in his own skin at last.\u2019",

More than a third of NHS trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments. Several have admitted they may impose 'eligibility' rules which could affect smokers as well as the overweight. More than a third of health trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments to save money, according to a new study . The criteria for accepting patients for operations would be based on their Body Mass Index, which measures obesity. When senior managers at 67 Clinical Commissioning Groups \u2013 local health trusts \u2013 were asked, 39 per cent said they were planning to 'limit access' to routine treatment for financial reasons. Procedures affected include varicose vein treatment, hip and knee replacement, and breast reduction surgery. Others said smokers might be denied some treatments, most commonly IVF. Senior doctors criticised the plans and accused health managers of denying patients vital treatment simply because they were considered to be 'undeserving'. Dr David Paynton, of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'Decisions about whether our patients are eligible for surgery or treatment need to be made on a case-by-case basis and by whether surgery will benefit a patient's long-term physical and mental health. 'It should not be the role of CCGs to impose blanket bans on patients' access to surgery, nor to decide who is and who is not deserving of potentially life-saving treatments based on their lifestyle choices. Obese patients could be denied\u00a0varicose vein treatment, hip and knee replacement, pictured, and breast reduction surgery, while smokers could be banned from having IVF on the NHS . 'Of course, some procedures cannot be performed on patients who are above a certain weight. 'In these cases, a clinical decision needs to be made about whether surgery would be beneficial if the patient lost weight \u2013 but this is a separate issue.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'Each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient. 'It is easy to target vulnerable patients and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who aren't always able to speak out.' A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'If health bodies stop patients from having treatments on the basis of cost alone, then we will take action against them.' There are 211 CCGs in England so the survey by the Health Service Journal covered just under a third. Last year, a CCG in Devon threatened to ban all non-urgent treatments for anyone severely obese with a BMI above 35. This is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman of 16st or a 6ft man being 18st 13lb. After an outcry, the policy was dropped. A survey by GP magazine last month found that 80 per cent of CCGs ration at least one procedure to patients who are very obese. Doctors have blamed excess sugar and carbohydrates for the surge in obesity \u2013 not the lack of exercise. They said poor diet was now recognised as being responsible for more disease than physical inactivity, alcohol and smoking combined. Yet, said the experts led by cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, the public wrongly believed that obesity was due to a sedentary lifestyle. The doctors claimed that obesity has rocketed in the past 30 years, despite little change in physical activity levels. \u2018This places the blame for our expanding waistlines directly on the type and amount of calories consumed,\u2019 said Dr Malhotra. \u2018Let us bust the myth of physical inactivity and obesity. You cannot outrun a bad diet.\u2019 In the British Journal Of Sports Medicine, the doctors added that the \u2018false perception\u2019 on the cause of obesity stems from corporate marketing \u2018chillingly similar\u2019 to that used by the tobacco industry. They cited Coca-Cola associating its products with sport \u2018suggesting it is OK to consume their drinks as long as you exercise\u2019. Dr Malhotra, who works at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, is an adviser to the campaign group Action on Sugar. Around two-thirds of Britons are overweight or obese. The Government\u2019s obesity adviser Professor Susan Jebb said the doctors failed to note that the best way to lose weight was combining a better diet with physical activity. \u2018Rather than trade one off against the other \u2013 sugar vs fat, diet vs activity, individual vs population \u2013 we need to take action across the full range,\u2019 she added. Tackling obesity without addressing physical activity was \u2018tying one hand behind our backs\u2019 said the professor. \u2018It makes good sense to seek to change both diet and activity behaviours.\u2019",

Police exhumed the boy's body from his grave in Norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review. A DNA sample eventually led them to his mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988, just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a Sunday afternoon outing. Scroll down for video . Unsolved case: A police officer searches Windmill Pit, the Norfolk pond where the baby boy's body was found back in 1988 . The boy's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review, with DNA samples leading police to the boy's mother. He has now been reburied at Weasenham St Peter church, Norfolk . Police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at 13th century St Peter's Church in the village. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . But after the body was exhumed in April last year, DNA taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said: 'It came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age. 'We went to see that individual and she told us she was mum. She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. 'We were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her. 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' The woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond, known locally as Windmill Pit, before it was found by a group of teenagers. The boy was originally buried without a name but \u00a0a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church . A second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play. An inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death. The baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named Peter after the name of the church. Det Insp Guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He added: 'This has been unsolved for 27 years. By using the latest techniques, we've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time.' 'We don't ever give up. All the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they're reviewed at regular intervals.' Det Insp Guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' A support group called Hana's Gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter. The inscription reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today . Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The New Jersey native bought the SoHo pad in 2007 for $24million, so even with the price cut is making an impressive profit. A bargain... for a billionaire: Jon Bon Jovi has sold his New York City apartment for $37.5million . On the road again: The Misunderstood singer seen here performing in Detroit, Michigan . The sale, by Douglas Elliman, was reported by Street Easy, though the buyer is not known. The duplex has two levels and comes with five bedrooms, five-and-a-half bathrooms and two  kitchens. Floor to ceiling windows offer panoramic views of the city, and 11-ft high ceilings make the interior open and filled with light. A wood-fire burning fireplaces add a homey feel to the spread which is decorated primarily in soft brown, beige and cream colors. Living large: With oversized windows and 11-foot-high ceilings the apartment has a light and airy feeling . Another major selling point was the large outdoor space. There are . three large, landscaped terraces that total almost 3,100 square feet. After the 51-year-old bought the property six . years ago, he did some renovations like changing the master . bedroom. He sold the house completely furnished. 'This one-of-a-kind apartment is for the discerning buyer who can . appreciate fine craftsmanship and all of the modern conveniences,' said the listing. The . property, which is located between Prince and Houston streets, sits on . the top floor of the New Museum\u2019s 158 Mercer Street building. This isn't the first time the Bon Jovi singer has listed the apartment. In 2010 he reportedly placed it on the market for $45m but then pulled the listing. It's my life...and my investment: The 51-year-old bought this downtown property for $24m in 2007 and his initial sales price was almost double that . This isn't the only property owned by the singer, born John Francis Bongiovi Jr. He and his wife Dorothea have a multi-acre river-front spread in the sleepy but swanky town of Red Bank, New Jersey, and a large . house on one of the most notable and costly streets in East Hampton, New York, . that they plucked up in August 2004 for $7.6million. In 2013 the band was estimated by Forbes to be worth approximately $79million. Their Because We Can Tour earned $3million per city, a massive number in the touring circuit. Jon gives back with Soul Kitchen, a pay as you want restaurant in New Jersey. On a clear day you can see forever: The person lucky enough to buy this penthouse won't gain only stunning views, they'll also inherit all of the furniture the rocker picked out himself . Now that's a family couch: The father of four could certainly fit his kids Stephanie, Jesse James, Jacob and Romeo on this semi-circle sofa that sits in front of a wood burning fireplace . Kitchen confidential: This dark wood style kitchen is just one of two in the two-level property . Living on a prayer, and a fluffy bed: This is just one of five bedrooms in Mr. Bongiovi's sprawling home . Outdoor living: There's almost 3,100 square feet of terrace to breathe in that Manhattan air . No, that's not Windsor Castle: This New Jersey native owns a sprawling mansion in his home state that looks fit for royalty . He'll be missed: Jon was seen talking to one of his neighbours at the NYC property he just sold .

The probation was decided last week but announced by the university Monday. 'Rutgers takes seriously its commitment to maintaining a healthy and safe campus environment,' the university said in a statement. Last month, a fraternity was shut down because of an underage drinking incident in November in which a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon was taken to a hospital after drinking heavily at the fraternity house. Rutgers University has banned fraternity and sorority house parties at its main campus for the rest of the spring semester after several alcohol-related problems this school year, including the death of a student . Victim:\u00a019-year-old student Caitlyn Kovacs died of alcohol poisoning after attending a fraternity party in September 2014 . And in September, a 19-year-old student, Caitlyn Kovacs, died of alcohol poisoning after attending a fraternity party. It's not clear whether she had been drinking there or elsewhere, though. Under the ban, the university's 86 recognized fraternities and sororities will be allowed to hold spring formals and other events where third-party vendors serve alcohol. Rutgers' announcement was made less than one month until the spring semester ends May 4. After two reading days, final exams start May 7 and finish May 13. The ban was first reported by NJ.com. School officials revealed the measure to Greek community leadership at a Wednesday night meeting, according to the media outlet. In a statement to NJ.com, Rutgers spokesman E.J. Miranda said '[The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs] is taking this step out of caution and concern and will use this time to continue and reinforce its dialogue with the leadership of the university's 86 recognized fraternities and sororities about Greek life at Rutgers and their responsibilities to the campus community at large. The university said last month that six fraternities and one sorority are under review for alcohol violations. It's not clear whether Kovacs had been drinking at the fraternity house or elsewhere, though . Under the ban, the university's 86 recognized fraternities and sororities will be allowed to hold spring formals and other events where third-party vendors serve alcohol . The ban comes at a time when fraternities have had a run of bad publicity. At the University of Oklahoma, fraternity members were caught on video singing a racist song; investigators have been looking into allegations that a Penn State fraternity had a private Facebook group with pictures of nude and partially nude women, some of them asleep or unconscious; there have been allegations that members of a Dartmouth fraternity were being branded in a hazing ritual; and two organizations at North Carolina State have been shut down, one over a sexist and racist book, another over sexual assault allegations. Erin Kearns, president of the Rutgers Panhellenic Association, a governing body for sororities, told NJ.com, that many leaders of Greek groups accept the house party ban in light of the negative attention at Rutgers and elsewhere. 'Our advisers and administration thought it would be best that Rutgers doesn't fall into that trap,' she said.",

In  ISIS's most recent video, a young doctor, identified as Tareq Kamleh, called on foreign medics to travel to the ISIS stronghold in Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service). The video of Kamleh, who refers to himself as Abu Yusuf, showed him handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. Scroll down for video . The blue-eyed Australian doctor who features in the latest IS propaganda video has been identified as\u00a0Tareq Kamleh . Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh introduces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . Once the propaganda video went viral, people from Kamleh's past started to recognise the previously unidentified doctor. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University. Upon completing his degree he reportedly worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. Kamleh then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, the Age reported. He completed his final stint in the Australian medical system working in Perth until late 2014. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University . 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests' A university student who knew Kamleh, but did not want to be named, said he showed no signs that he would defect to the radical militant group. 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests,' she told\u00a0news.com.au. She said the 'clean cut' doctor was well known in her social circle as a 'womaniser' who didn't shy away from drinking alcohol. Kamleh was also recognised by Dr Stephen Napoli, co-owner of the Mannum Medical Centre in South Australia. He told the Age\u00a0the 'intelligent' doctor had interned with him for 10 weeks back in 2010. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge,' Dr Napoli said. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge' Kamleh was known to practice medicine in Adelaide, Mackay and finally in Perth before he took up working for IS . Dr Napoli agreed that Kamleh had shown no signs of holding extreme Islamic views. 'There was no indication I'd be worried about his other associations when he was with us. 'There was nothing that I saw of his work as a medical practical that would suggest he would have any of these sorts of views.' The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic\u00a0Britain's National Health Service . A former college from Adelaide Hospital also came forward reporting that he recognised Kamleh in the footage immediately. 'I was taken aback as much because I certain certainly wouldn't have associated him with an association like IS. His principle seemed to be sound and focused on the care of his patients,' he told the Age. The collegue, who also chose not to be identified, said Kamleh's behaviours were not consistent with the Islamic State's conservative views on drinking or dating. 'I know he dated a few nurses and other doctors over the years\u2026 he was heterosexual and certainly interested in the ladies, with some success.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The video featuring Kamleh, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows the doctor interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,' he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. 'It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. 'We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . 'The video is interesting because it's trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.' 'In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.' Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. 'They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren't trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?' Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas.

The footage, which appeared on social media on Thursday, comes after nine Brritish medical students travelled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat victims of the civil war. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The students have been named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir. In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of online extremist propaganda. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages.",

Two 49-year-old women and a 23-year-old man  were removed from the plane just before it left Bristol for Faro around 7pm yesterday (Thursday). Chris Ware, head of security at Bristol Airport said: 'The Bristol Airport police team were requested by flight crew to attend a delayed departing flight to Faro. A Ryanair flight took off without three booked passengers bound for Faro yesterday after they were arrested for being drunk and disorderly . 'The airline requested the delayed passengers board the flight in anticipation of the air traffic slot time improving. 'Three passengers were removed from the aircraft and subsequently arrested. 'Abusive, aggressive or anti-social behaviour on board an aircraft or at the Airport will not be tolerated, the normal protocol of dealing with disruptive passengers was implemented. 'Unfortunately the actions of these individual passengers further delayed the aircraft's departure.' Airport Team Sergeant Mick Parminter added: 'We want everyone who travels through the airport to have a safe and enjoyable start to their trip. 'We would warn anyone travelling through the airport to know their limits. Passengers have a personal responsibility for their own behaviour. 'On average over half a million passengers travel through the airport every month without incident however we will not allow the behaviour of a few to spoil the enjoyment and travel plans for everyone else. 'Alcohol-related anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.' Bristol Airport confirmed that the drunk passengers' actions caused further delays to the Ryanair flight . A spokesperson for Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'The crew of this flight from Bristol to Faro requested police assistance prior to departure after three customers became disruptive. Police removed and detained these individuals before the aircraft departed to Faro. 'We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and we sincerely apologised to other customers for any inconvenience caused. 'The safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. This is now a matter for local police.' This latest incident comes only days after Ryanair took the unprecedented step of banning passengers from bringing their own booze on board flights between Glasgow and the party island of Ibiza out of concerns for safety and comfort. The Dublin-based airline informed passengers travelling on the notorious flight from Glasgow Prestwick Airport to the Spanish island that their alcohol purchases from duty free shops are no longer allowed in the cabin, and they risk being kicked off the flight if they don't comply. In a statement to MailOnline Travel, a Ryanair spokesman said the airline made the decision after consultations with customers and airport officials. The spokesman said: 'Those who have purchased duty free alcohol will be asked to either place their purchases in their cabin baggage and into the hold at the boarding gate, or leave their purchases behind. 'The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour at any time.' The spokesman declined to identify the incidents which sparked the ban or say what will happen to passengers caught trying to sneak alcohol on board.",

He is being fed three times a day at the dairy farm where he was born, in Narnaul, northern India. Scroll down for video . On everyone's lips: This calf in northern India has five mouths and is attracting a stream of human visitors . Normal body: From the neck down the baby, who has been called Nandi, looks like any other calf . Dinner time: Nandi sucks from his mother's udders with one of his mouths. She feeds him three times a day . Shocked locals have called the calf Nandi - a nickname for Lord Krishna. It can also mean 'one who pleases others'. In India's Hindu culture, cows are revered as a symbol of life. Nandi is attracting a constant stream of visitors wanting to celebrate him. Many of them kneel before him to pray and touch his hooves. Local vet Sukhbir Singh said that despite Nandi's appearance, he is healthy and thriving.\u00a0But the calf's two eyes are positioned in such a way on his distorted head that he can only see to his sides and can't look in front of him. One eye is blue and the other black. Other strange-looking bovine have been recorded in recent years, including a buffalo with three mouths and three eyes that was in in 2009, also in northern India, in 2009.

Celebrating him: Local schoolchildren kneel and pray at Nandi's feet. Cows are revered in the Hindu faith . Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads\u00a0but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too. Two-faced: This 440kg bull, which has faces on top of each other, was sold to an abattoir last month . Double-headed: The female calf born that was born in Whiting, Vermont, two years ago .

But Sharon and Mike Tierney have taken their mutual upkeep to a whole new level, believing that 'the couple that waxes together, stays together.' The Sydney-based duo set aside an evening once a month to tend to all their beauty maintenance needs. Sharon, 45, trims her 40-year-old husband's eyebrows, wax his nostrils and even grooms his pubic hair. Scroll down for video . High maintenance: Sydney couple Mike and Sharon Tierney set aside one evening per month for mutual grooming . You wax my back, I'll wax yours: Sharon trims her husband's eyebrows, waxes his nostrils and trims his pubic hairs, while he returns the favours with waxing, spray tans and eyelash tints . For his part, Mike has been well trained in the art of waxing, and waxes her underarms, legs, upper lip and chin, and can even perform a Brazilian wax. The British ex-pat can also tint eyelashes and give Sharon a spray tan. Sharon admits while some women are horrified about their man seeing their lady parts in all their hairy glory, she says there's no limitations to their marriage. 'He\u2019s seen everything, there\u2019s nothing I wouldn't not let him see,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Being a well-groomed gentleman can be a dangerous undertaking though. Regime: While most couples may admit to assisting each other with squeezing the odd hard-to-reach pimple, but Sharon and Mike take it to a whole new level . Close cut: One hair incident involved Sharon attempting to give her husband a 'number one', and ended up cutting his scrotum . 'He says it\u2019s for neatness,' Sharon said of her husband's preference for a 'number one' in the pubic region, 'but I think it\u2019s to gain that precious \u201coptical inch\u201d.' One evening during their usual pluck, wax and clipping session, things got a little bit hairy. 'I thought we should stretch the optical illusion to its limits, so I removed the clipper guard to get the closest possible trim. We were coasting along brilliantly until we hit the scrotum and its soft, sagging, sensitive skin,' she said. The worst happened, and a poor, screaming Mike was left with a bleeding cut in the most sensitive of body parts. 'I was just trying to make his penis look bigger,' said Sharon. 'Not that it\u2019s not big, but that\u2019s what men want isn\u2019t it?\u201d' The trimmed twosome began their mutual grooming regime together 13 years ago. The couple met in London at a Pop Idol party when Sharon was on a holiday to the UK. Their fling turned into a relationship, with Sharon moving to London. During her time their, she struggled to find a decent waxing therapist. Upon returning to Australia, Sharon spent six months training in beauty therapy to open her own salon, and turned to her husband to play guinea pig. Guinea pig: Mike was enlisted when Sharon was training to become a professional waxer and needed someone to practise on . Mike was enlisted to step in when she was training up her junior therapists.\u00a0'One of the girls said her boyfriend could do it but they broke up two days before and we needed a model and I told Mike we were desperate - and he agreed, Sharon told Daily Mail Australia. 'God love him, there he was butt naked in front of my blonde, 20 year old staff, he would do anything to support me.' In business: After struggling to find a decent wax while living in London, Sharon trained and opened her own salon upon returning to Australia . 'He's a good sport and just goes along with it - which is nice because he's English and very conservative - it shows he will do anything for me.' 'I get Mike to use a bit of both types of wax. Usually strip wax on your labia is too sensitive, so I use it around the edges and use a hot wax on intimate areas, such as Veet Naturals Warm Wax.' While the sliced scrotum wasn't severe enough to land Mike in the hospital, an ill-timed bout of appendicitis did spell embarrassment for the Englishman. 'It was only an hour after getting waxed he was rushed to hospital with emergency appendicitis,' said Sharon. 'A young female doctor  said, \"I'm really sorry we have to check your testicles,\" and he was so embarrassed. From London to Oz: The couple met in the UK when Australian Sharon was there on holiday 13 years ago . Metro man: From clipping and trimming to waxing and tinting, men are more open to beauty maintenance than ever . 'She asked what I did for a living and I said - \"you\u2019re about to find out!\" She was in fits of laughter when I told her and poor Mike had all these doctors checking out his freshly waxed scrotum.' 'But in the end because all the hospital staff knew, everyone ended up taking brochures and we got a heap of new clients, so it turned it into a positive thing. Not to mention he quite enjoyed all the nurses saying \"oh you\u2019re the one with the Brazilian.\" ' As for their ventures 'down under' together, Sharon has now written a tell-all book to give women guidance on what's normal down there and a expose on their hilarious adventures together, aptly titled 'The Vagina Buffet.' 'I think when you put your hand on someone\u2019s vagina it\u2019s like they get verbal diarrhoea, they want to get comfortable with you and tell you everything, it\u2019s unbelievable how much I've learned about people and the vagina.'",

Coming in the 86th minute of Saturday's match it was by no means his most spectacular, a mere flick from six yards out enough to take the ball past Adrian after a scuffed Jamie Vardy shot. But it was enough to defeat West Ham in a frenetic match and breathe life back into the side he has spent his whole career playing for. Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points . King is joined by David Nugent to celebrate his goal, the 50th he has scored for his club . Leicester remain at the foot of the Barclay\u2019s Premier League table, a spot they have occupied since November, and four points from safety. But King, 26, thinks the momentum they are taking into the final eight matches of the season could be enough to propel them above the drop zone. \u2018I\u2019ve scored some pretty crucial goals before, but we might look back at the end of the season and that might turn out to be the most important one yet,\u2019 said King, . \u2018It\u2019s always nice to score for the only club you\u2019ve ever played for. I\u2019ve had a brilliant journey with this club. 'I\u2019ve been on 49 for a long time, and I\u2019ve been in the Premier League for a good few months now - I was hoping it would\u2019ve come earlier but I\u2019ve ticked that milestone off now and I\u2019m delighted about that. Nigel Pearson admits Leicester survival is still a 'big ask' despite win over West Ham . Pearson congratulates goalscorer Cambiasso after the final whistle of his side's win against the Hammers . \u2018But most importantly it was about getting the three points and we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of the season to make sure we\u2019re a Premier League team next season. \u2018We\u2019ve played well enough to prove we can survive and we\u2019ve not turned it into results - this is a results business. That proves to everyone - not just ourselves - that we mean business.\u2019 Leicester manager Nigel Pearson praised King, who he brought off the bench with 12 minutes to play and said his team were finally getting the results they deserved after several games this season where they have drawn or lost despite dominating. \u2018I would love to be a lucky manager who plays crap and wins but we have not been that,\u2019 he said. King says his goal against West Ham may turn out to be his most important for the club if they stay up . \u2018It would be a pretty grumpy man who wouldn't let them enjoy winning but we have to keep our destiny in our own hands.\u2019 His opposite number Sam Allardyce denied West Ham were \u2018drifting\u2019 towards the end of the season having won just twice in the last 14 games. \u2018We\u2019re not drifting but where we\u2019re failing is we\u2019re not as clinical as we used to be. Lads in their first season have found out what physical and mental attributes are needed for a long premier league season.\u2019",

The Southwest Airlines flight which was scheduled to leave  Midway International Airport at 1.15pm was delayed for almost two hours due to the 'disturbance'. The Chicago Fire Department was called to evaluate Mr Modarkski after he was stabbed in the arm. Mr Mordarski said he would not be pressing charges following the incident. His best friend, photographer Michael Sutton, said the pen stabbing began after Lenny's arm brushed up against the woman while he slept. Mr Sutton, 41, told Daily Mail Online: 'She took her pen and stabbed his arm several times causing him to yell out in pain. 'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment. 'Luckily he wore a thick long sleeve shirt or there would have been blood. He will have a few bruises in the morning. 'The passengers cheered when they heard she wasn't coming back on.' Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, South West Airlines said: 'A customer on flight 577 was removed from the flight before takeoff after poking her seatmate in the arm with a pen.

An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season. Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton . Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League. Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay. 'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said. 'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong. 'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest. 'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club. Clyne made his full England debut last November . 'We need understanding for that but nothing else. 'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. We know our level, we know our possibilities. 'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.' Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign. 'We don't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something,' he said. 'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on. 'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.' Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull. Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez. It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City. There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week. 'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them. 'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club. Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool . Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence . 'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.' Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future. Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned. But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager. 'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'",

The wraps came off the prototype of the new 10th generation car at the New York International motor show. It came just a day after it was announced that Swindon in Wiltshire will become the global production hub for the next generation five door Civic, supported by a new \u00a3200million investment. The ultra-sporty Honda Civic Concept car is presented at the New York International Auto Show, Wednesday . Although the dramatic Kermit green prototype seen in New York is a three-door version, the Swindon factory will be exporting the five-door hatchback version around the globe. A Honda spokesman said: \u2018With more focus on sporty, fun-to-drive dynamics the new U.S. Civic line-up will include Civic saloon, Coup\u00e9 and Si models, along with the return of the Civic five-door hatchback to the U.S. market. \u2018 . These will be followed by the launch of a next generation Civic Type R in the U.S. market, as the \u2018performance flagship\u2019 of the Civic line-up. Currently, just over half of the vehicles produced at Swindon are exported to the Continent. But when the factory moves to dedicated Civic production next year, about 50 per cent of production will be exported to key markets outside of Europe, including Japan and now the USA. The Swindon factory will be exporting the five-door hatchback version of the Honda Civic around the globe . John Mendel, senior vice president, automobile operations of American Honda Motor Co., introduce the ultra-sporty Civic Concept car . Currently, just over half of the vehicles produced at Swindon are exported to the Continent . Philip Crossman, managing director of Honda UK said: \u2019This is significant announcement demonstrates the opportunity available to the Swindon operation and reinforces the quality and reliability of the product coming from our UK facility.\u2019 Honda designer Guy Melville-Brown, a who worked on the new Civic\u2019s exterior styling said: \u2018This is the first time the Civic has been born in America. He promised the new Civic will have sporty proportions, with the windshield moved toward the rear, a shorter front overhang and longer rear overhang than the current Civic. The car will get new engines and transmissions, including a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder motor in higher-end models, Honda says. The sedan version will be in showrooms this fall, with a coupe and a high-performance R-Type coming later. Honda last rolled out an all-new Civic in 2011, and it was widely panned for bland styling, cabin noise and pedestrian handling. The Japanese car-maker was forced to quickly make improvements to the car at the end of 2012. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The Labour leader said a second independence poll 'ain't going to happen' even if he becomes Prime Minister with the support of SNP MPs next month. Mr Miliband's intervention came as the former prime minister John Major warned that the SNP was 'merely waiting for a good excuse to put separation back on the agenda'. Labour leader Ed Miliband, interviewed on the BBC this morning, explicitly ruled out allowing another Scottish independence referendum . Mr Major said the SNP would break their pledge not to hold another referendum 'for a generation'. He said the SNP were 'determined to prise apart the United Kingdom'. Former foreign secretary William Hague added that SNP could be 'calling the tune' if Ed Miliband became PM on the back of SNP support. He said this would mean: 'The people who want to break up the United Kingdom will be running the United Kingdom.' But Mr Miliband this morning accused the Tories of 'threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom' by talking up the prospects of Scottish nationalists in the May 7 General Election. The Labour leader insisted there would be no coalition with the SNP and flatly ruled out holding another referendum. He told BBC1's Breakfast that he had 'fundamental differences' with the SNP \u2013 including on a second independence referendum within five years. He said, adding: 'I'm not having that.' The Labour leader said a second independence poll 'ain't going to happen' even if he becomes Prime Minister with the support of SNP MPs next month . Labour party leader Mr Miliband addresses an audience during a campaign stop in Manchester this morning . Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had been 'talking up' the SNP in the hope that it would take votes and seats from Labour north of the border and allow him to 'crawl back' into 10 Downing Street. 'I think David Cameron is playing fast and loose with the United Kingdom,' said the Labour leader. 'This is somebody who has given up hope of winning a majority. He is trying to boost the SNP. 'I think David Cameron is now threatening the integrity of the UK with the games he is playing. And I think Conservatives are now ashamed of what he is doing.' Mr Miliband cited Conservative former Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth who has warned that the party's tactic of targeting a Labour-SNP link-up was 'short-term and dangerous' and could ultimately damage the Union. In a BBC interview last night, the Labour leader insisted he would not be dictated to by the nationalists, even if he had to govern without an overall majority in the new parliament. But Sir John Major said that, in practice, Mr Miliband would be forced to accede to the SNP's demands or face the collapse of his government. 'If Labour were to accept an offer of support from the SNP, it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote-by-vote basis,' he said. Mr Miliband's intervention came as the former prime minister John Major warned that the SNP was 'merely waiting for a good excuse to put separation back on the agenda' Sir John added: 'Labour would be in hock to a party that - slowly but surely - will push them ever further to the left. And who would pay the price for this? We all would. We would all pay for the SNP's ransom in our daily lives - through higher taxes, fewer jobs, and more and more debt. 'This is a recipe for mayhem. At the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government, we risk a weak and unstable one - pushed to the left by its allies, and open to a daily dose of political blackmail.' The former premier pointed to the way that Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy has already suggested that funds raised from the party's planned 'mansion tax' in England could go to Scotland. 'If a Labour leader asks for that, how much more will the SNP demand?' Sir John is expected to say. 'And if this is the way Labour intends to behave towards England, how can they say no to the SNP? And if Labour did say no, the SNP could withdraw support and bring down the government at any time.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon addressed the Scottish Trade Union Congress during a campaign visit to in Ayr this morning .

With the opinion polls pointing to a hung parliament with the SNP holding the balance of power as the third largest party, the threat of a nationalist link-up with Labour has emerged as the main Conservative line of attack in the election campaign. The tactic has caused misgivings among some Tories. Lord Forsyth - who served as Scottish secretary in Sir John's government - warned that building up the SNP to undermine support for Labour in England could ultimately damage the Union. 'We've had the dilemma for Conservatives, which is they want to be the largest party at Westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in Scotland will be helpful,' he told the Guardian. 'But that is a short-term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country.' He said Mr Cameron's call for 'English votes for English laws' in the aftermath of last year's Scottish independence referendum vote had 'shattered the unionist alliance against the break-up of the United Kingdom'. Labour MP David Lammy this morning admitted that the party would strike a deal with the SNP after the election . Meanwhile, former Labour minister and London mayoral contender David Lammy suggested that the party could 'do business' with the SNP after the election. 'I think we can win this election. But clearly, after the General Election, you would forge common alliance with parties that you can actually do business with and the SNP must be part of that story,' he told ITV News. 'I still think Labour can form the next government and that's what I am fighting for. But, yes, there is common ground with other parties and the SNP would be included in that and we may need to enter into discussion after the General Election.'",

On Saturday, Obama spent his Saturday afternoon golfing at Joint Base Andrews. The president's busy week ahead includes hosting Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, and honoring the Ohio State University Buckeyes football team, the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champions and the Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots.

He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent, throwing the Government, which holds a razor-thin majority, into chaos.

The statement has sparked criticism on social media, with some users questioning his terminology . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences . Mr Katter has since defended the statement, saying he used the term black puppet 'because I'm dark and I come from Cloncurry.' 'I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I'm going to call it for what it is,' he said. 'I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought, because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones.'

Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full\u00a0qualifying\u00a0report. Host commentator . Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday\u2019s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson . \u2018Oh come on, guys\u2019, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn\u2019t matter as Rosberg can\u2019t beat his lap. It is Hamilton\u2019s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they\u2019re all on fresh tyres. Here we go\u2026 . Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We\u2019ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903\u2026 but it is Hamilton up next. We\u2019ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we\u2019re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10\u2026 surely, Lewis Hamilton won\u2019t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we\u2019re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen, \u00a0but he is half-a-second off Hamilton\u2019s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton\u2026 what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That\u2019s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow\u2019s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go\u2026 . Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn\u2019s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the \u2018rears are overheating\u2019. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth\u2026 for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes is fired up, but there\u2019s no problem with the world champion\u2019s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap\u2026 . Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week\u2019s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday\u2019s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: \u2018I want a car. I\u2019ve got a ticket.\u2019 Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon\u2019s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton\u2019s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today\u2019s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they \u00a0were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.",

Other projects to be worked on include improved habitats for humans, and small satellites to explore deep space. And one of the companies in the 12 Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextStep) says they have an engine that could get humans to Mars in just 39 days. Scroll down for video . Nasa has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies, including a faster method of propulsion known as Vasimr (illustrated), which could apparently get to Mars in a matter of weeks, not months . The Vasimr engine - which uses plasma as a propellant - is being developed by the Ad Astra Rocket company in Texas. Their engine shot to fame a few years ago when it was revealed that it could drastically reduce the journey time to Mars from months to weeks - although it may require a nuclear power source. And following the successful test of a prototype in 2013, it seems Nasa is now considering it for use on a future mission to Mars. Short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, Vasimr works with plasma, an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field also insulates nearby structures so exhaust temperatures well beyond the melting point of materials can be achieved. In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low. \u2018We are thrilled by this announcement and proud to be joining forces with Nasa in the final steps of the technology maturation,\u2019 said Dr Franklin Chang Diaz, Ad Astra\u2019s Chairman and CEO, in a statement. \u2018We look forward to a very successful partnership as we jointly advance the technology to flight readiness.\u2019 Over three years, Nasa will give the company about \u00a36.8 million ($10 million) to get the engine almost ready to fly in space. This will be achieved with a demonstration of their new prototype, the VX-200-SS, which will be able to fire continuously for more than 100 hours. A previous test in 2013 saw Ad Astra complete 10,000 successful high power firings of a Vasimr prototype. However, this involved short duration bursts for less than a minute. Proving the engine works for more than 100 hours will be key to it one day being used on a spacecraft. The Vasimr engine is seen here being tested.\u00a0Short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, Vasimr works with plasma, an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields . In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets like Vasimr (illustrated) feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low . The Vasimr engine could be part of the entire spacecraft that will ultimately take astronauts to Mars. The rocket that will send them on their way will be the Space Launch System, illustrated, which will complete an unmanned flight in 2019 - and it will have room for some secondary payloads to go to deep space . Owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars, there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in another. Just getting there will take up to nine months. The astronauts will then be there waiting for a year until they can come back, again taking up to nine months - a total of around three years. Whether an engine such as Vasimr could shorten the time it would take to cover the distance, though, remains to be seen. With this and other technologies, Nasa said in a statement they want to develop exploration capabilities around the moon, and at Mars. \u2018Commercial partners were selected for their technical ability to mature key technologies and their commitment to the potential applications both for government and private sector uses,\u2019 said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations at Nasa Headquarters. \u2018This work ultimately will inform the strategy to move human presence further into the solar system.\u2019 Three advanced electric propulsion projects, including Vasimr, will develop engines that operate in the 50 to 300 kilowatt range. By comparison, current electric propulsion used by Nasa - such as the ion engine on the Dawn spacecraft - operates at less than five kilowatts. Meanwhile, seven companies have been picked to work on the habitats that will house astronauts as they make their way to Mars in the 2030s. While the Orion capsule will take astronauts to and from Earth, it can only sustain a crew of four for 21 days. To make the journey to Mars, expected to last anywhere from several months to three years, astronauts will need to live in some other structure. Nasa will be hoping one of the projects it is funding will find a way to house the astronauts for the grueling journey to and from the red planet. While the Orion capsule (shown after test flight in December 2014) will take astronauts to and from Earth, it can only sustain a crew of four for 21 days. To make the journey to Mars, expected to last anywhere from several months to three years, astronauts will need to live in some other structure . Previously, Boeing outlined the six steps needed to land and return on Mars (illustrated). Two are already in production - the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket. The other four things needed are a large 'tug' spacecraft, a habitat, lander and an ascent vehicle - all of which Nasa is hoping to develop in the next decade or so . Nasa is also asking companies to development capabilities to sustain a crew of four for 60 days in cis-lunar space - between Earth and the moon - with the ability to scale up to Mars missions. The companies selected include Bigelow Aerospace, who are creating an inflatable habitation module - a prototype of which will be attached to the ISS in 2018. And finally, two companies have been selected to develop small satellites - CubeSats - to launch as secondary paylods on the first flight of Nasa\u2019s huge Space Launch System rocket in 2019. As the rocket is so powerful, it will give these CubeSats a rare opportunity to explore deep space, as opposed to remaining in Earth orbit.

Last year Hawaiian-born photographer Dustin Wong, 31, abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company. Inspired by ancient Hawaiian beliefs in the sacredness of the landscape, Dustin Wong, 31, has journeyed from the Arctic Circle to Australia, capturing moments where men and women are alone with the power and splendour of the natural world. This single bikini-clad woman stretches her curvaceous body while silhouetted against a spectacular Hawaiian sunset . Faced with the rapid destruction of habitats through pollution and overpopulation, the photographer hopes his images will inspire the viewer with awe at the intricate and diverse world we live in and encourage them to protect the planet. He writes on his website: 'I have a desire to experience the natural world and to let those feelings inspire me. Life on this planet is older than any of us can comprehend, and there is a beauty in that history and power. However, these days our natural spaces are being encroached upon by human development. A man gazes upon a whirl of stars in\u00a0the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the salt-covered land cracks into spectacular patterns . Last year Hawiian-born photographer Dustin Wong, 31, abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company . 'Through my images I try to convey a sense of awe of the incredibly intricate and diverse world we share. I want to encourage people to interact and experience nature for themselves. I think this way more people will care about protecting and preserving natural environments.' He started taking photographs 15 years ago before taking it up full time last year. He traveled all over the west coast of the US living out of a van for five months and visited as many national parks as he could. In Queensland Australia, he follows a woman as she ventures into the dark depths of a natural cavern . His journeying in America took in the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the land cracks into spectacular patterns, the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the third largest hot spring in the world whose bright colours are caused by bacteria, to the Burning Man Festival in Nevada, which culminates in the burning of a wooden effigy. Other pictures show a spectacular Hawaiian sunset reflected in the sand in improbable bright oranges and reds, or a single solitary figure dwarfed by the waterfall surging above him at at Latourell Falls in Oregan. Revellers climb on top of a massive sculpture of the words 'Believe' at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada . For these photographs he also ventured to Australia, following a woman as she explores a cavern in Queensland, and to Norway, where he captures the stunning greens of the Northern Lights, or a firework exploding against a frosty night-time pine forest. Mr Wong takes his photographs using a DSLR camera before transforming them into High Dynamic Range to bring out colour and detail. He then blends the HDR image with the original exposures, creating an image that is 'slightly fantastical yet still rooted in reality'. The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, is the third largest hot spring in the world. Its bright colours are caused by pigmented bacteria . His images depict people interacting with the environment and enjoying themselves in the outdoors. At first he shunned using people in his images, which he wanted to capture nature at its pristine best, but he later realised a single figure - either a stranger or himself - provides a sense of scale and helps viewers relate more viscerally to the image in front of them. Although he now lives in Seattle in the USA, he credits his Hawaiian upbringing as the driving force behind his vision of the world. A single figure on a Norwegian beach is bathed in green light as he admires the spectacular Northern Light . He adds: 'Born and raised in Hawaii, I learned about the Hawaiian culture, specifically the way the Ancient Hawaiians held the land in reverence. Those teachings instilled in me an understanding that human beings have an intrinsic relationship with the land that should be held in high respect. 'I aim to create a sense of wonder in each of my pieces. I want to recapture the sense of awe and childhood imagination that often gets abandoned along the way to adulthood. I create art where the viewer is free to wallow in the mysteries and unknown of a beautiful landscape.' Standing in the middle of a snow-covered Norwegian pine forest, a couple release a firework, sending orange blazing into the sky . He uses a single figure like this man dwarfed by the water at Latourell Falls, Oregan, USA, to engourage a visceral response in viewers .",

It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for \u00a325million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite.\u00a0Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property,\u00a0Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best. 'As the location of Mayfair\u2019s dairy, the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site, without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls. 'The result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic Mayfair.' The house has four bedrooms which all come with their own en suite bathrooms and is set over four floors. It was built in 2011 . One of the four bedrooms in the house is finished with sleek white, grey and black furniture and soft furnishings throughout . Another of the guest rooms in the luxury mansion furnished in cream and peach. The house has been described by estate agents as a 'flowing family house' One of the double bathrooms in the house has a deep marble bath, his and her's sinks and a large, walk-in shower . The property's master suite takes up the entire second floor with a huge bedroom and 'living space' which features a stunning fireplace . The dressing room in the master suite boasts high-gloss white wardrobes, fluffy white carpet and a grey bench for resting . An enormous jacuzzi bath in the middle of the master suite's bathroom, with his and her sinks and a walk in double shower beyond it . Another of the luxurious bathrooms is fitted with a black and grey bath and shower. Experts said the property was an example of 'contemporary living in historic Mayfair' A courtyard in the property offers another outdoor seating. Part of its tiles have been replaced with glass exposing the leisure complex beneath . The luxury home also has a steam room adorned in shimmer silver mosaic and several outdoor spaces for residents to take in sun . A sweeping sun terrace on the building's roof where residents and guests can take in views of the historic Mayfair village . A sleek white and brown kitchen leads out to a sun-trapped patio on one of the house's floors. There is also a kitchenette elsewhere . An aerial view of the staircase shows the house's four floors, with golden sculptures found on shelves the whole way down . A fully-equipped gym has also been installed in the basement of the house and even has a flat-screen TV fitted on a wall of mirrors . High quality finishings are seen throughout the property which is found in one of London's most exclusive areas .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nChristian Benteke faces a substantial pay cut if his goals are not enough to keep Aston Villa in the Premier League \u2013 but is set to attract interest should he continue his scoring streak. Whatever Villa's Premier League status this summer, Benteke's future will be discussed as his contract, worth \u00a350,000 per week, enters its final two years and the Belgian striker has ambitions to play European football. Wolfsburg have kept tabs on Benteke since before he ruptured his Achilles 12 months ago and remain on the lookout for a striker. The wealthy German club, currently second in Bundesliga, should have funds available from Champions League money, even after their \u00a342million splurge on Chelsea duo Kevin De Bruyne and Andre Schurrle. Christian Benteke celebrates his opening goal against QPR at Villa Park on Tuesday . Villa value their top scorer at \u00a325million however, and even then would remain hugely reluctant to sell with manager Tim Sherwood a big fan. Randy Lerner is set to offload the club come the closed season and new owners will have their own thoughts. A hat-trick by Benteke in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers, capped by a brilliant free-kick, underlined his return to form under Sherwood. He has scored seven goals in his last five Villa games, earning the team an additional three points in the process \u2013 the current gap to the drop zone. Benteke went on to net a hat-trick which salvaged a vital point for his side . But should Villa slip below the dreaded dotted line and out of the Premier League, Benteke is in line for an approximate 30 per cent reduction on his wages to \u00a335,000 a week. The 24-year-old would look to leave Villa Park in that scenario, rather than play in the Championship, with a host of clubs likely to express interest. There is, however, no relegation release clause. Even if Villa stay in the Premier League Benteke will assess his options. Two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to force a move to Tottenham Hotspur following his debut season in England yielding 23 goals. The arrival of Tim Sherwood at Villa Park has rejuvenated Benteke's form in front of goal this season . He signed a new four-year deal on vastly improved terms. Last season was less successful, bringing 11 goals before serious injury struck last April ruling Benteke out of the World Cup. His form suffered on return to the side last October, and at times he cut a bereft figure starved of service under Paul Lambert's regime. Lambert even dropped Benteke in his penultimate game in charge at home to Chelsea. Sherwood's arrival has seen Benteke return to his best, with a goal every 87 minutes. That kind of strike rate should keep Villa up, but also alert top-flight clubs. Spurs are looking to sign young players around the \u00a315million mark, though, while Liverpool would need to shift Mario Balotelli. Jack Grealish is convinced Benteke's goals will ensure Villa's Premier League survival this season . Benteke is comfortable with life in Birmingham and at Villa, but holds desires to play higher up the league and in continental competitions. Qualification for the Europa League is still a possibility through the FA Cup for Villa, of course. Teenage winger Jack Grealish, who started his first Premier League match against QPR, is adamant Benteke will help keep Villa safe. 'Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,' he said. 'We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Spurs) positive. 100 per cent we will stay up.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nHollie Tillbrook, 17, was saved by two off-duty police officers when she had a heart attack in Basildon, Essex . A teenager battling bulimia who 'died' on the street from a heart attack was saved by a pair of off-duty police officers who gave her CPR. Hollie Tillbrook, 17, was out with her boyfriend in Basildon's Festival Leisure Park, Essex, when she suddenly collapsed. Doctors believe her potassium levels had plummeted to such a low level that her heart completely stopped. But luckily, two officers, believed to be from the Met Police, rushed to her side and gave Hollie life-saving CPR until an ambulance arrived. She was then rushed to Basildon hospital, where she was put into an induced coma. But the teenager then made an unexpected recovery which stunned medics. She is now recovering at her home in Leigh, Essex, despite her mother Denise Bennett being told to expect the worst. The family are now trying to find the police officers who saved Hollie so they can thank them in person. Hollie said: 'I don't remember much about what happened that day but I owe the doctors and the off-duty officers everything. 'I feel very tired still and I know I have a long recovery ahead. It's been really horrible but I am so thankful to be alive.' Ms Bennett added: 'I would love to be able to meet the police officers who saved my daughter's life and for them to get in touch . 'I really want to thank the two off duty police officers that saved my daughter's life. They are just absolute heroes. 'And also the critical care team at Basildon Hospital - the treatment she received there was brilliant.' The drama unfolded while Hollie was waiting outside the Chiquito's restaurant while her boyfriend Gary Hobbs\u00a0went to park his car. When he came back, he found Hollie laying on the floor with a crowd gathered around her. Ms Bennett then received a phone call, telling her what had happened. The 17-year-old, who suffers with bulimia, had collapsed because she had a dangerous level of potassium in her body. She is now recovering at home with her mother Denise Bennett (right) Humans need potassium in higher amounts than any other mineral. Adults need around 3,500mg in their body per day. Potassium plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acid/alkaline balance of the body. It is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly. It also counterbalances sodium in the body, and is known to help lower blood pressure. To get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium. The Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults (HMSO 1990) showed that the average intake of potassium is 3,187mg in males and 2,434mg in females. Compared with the daily recommendation of 3500mg intakes they are therefore low. People most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly, athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs. Heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake. She said: 'Fortunately a young bouncer working at the park had the presence of mind to take her phone and ring me. 'He said to me \"your daughter has collapsed and is receiving CPR\". I asked if she was responding and he just went quiet and said \"no\". The drive from Leigh to Basildon was awful. It was terrifying.' Hollie was transferred to Basildon Hospital where doctors told Ms Bennett that her heart had stopped. She had technically died for a short time, they said. The teen was then put into an induced coma. Doctors told Ms Bennett to return in the morning but to prepare for the worst. She said: 'I went home to Hollie's bedroom and was just clutching the coat she had been wearing. I was crying and crying.' But, the next morning, doctors began to bring Hollie out of the coma and she started to breathe on her own. Five days later she was allowed home. Ms Bennett said: 'I really want to warn other young people about the effects of bulimia. 'I know it is an illness but it is beyond my comprehension why these kids do this. It is not a game. It can have life-threatening consequences.' Hollie suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which her mother believes caused her to become depressed and develop bulimia. Doctors believe that Hollie had been so sick that her potassium levels had dropped to a dangerous level.",

Beautician Chernae Noonan, who founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar, has blocked the cosmetic giant's application to trademark the phrase. BeneFit is owned by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), which is run by luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault. Australian beautician Chernae Noonan founded eyebrow shaping business The Brow Bar in 2003 . Mr Arnault's estimate wealth is thought to be $37.4 billion and makes him the second richest person in France, according to\u00a0Forbes. The case between Ms Noonan and BeneFit was heard in the Australian Trade Marks Office\u00a0earlier this year in February and ruled in the Queensland woman's favour. Ms Noonan started her business in 2003 in her Springwood home and since then it has seen 'significant growth'. She has rolled out six stores across Australia - including on the Gold Coast, Sydney and Melbourne. She has stopped BeneFit Cosmetics from using 'Brow Bar' exclusively after the company launched an application to trademark the term in Australia . The Brow Bar services 'women of relatively high disposable income aged 25 to 55' along with a small group of men. Ms Noonan took action against BeneFit when the cosmetics giant sought to trademark 'Brow Bar' in Australia in 2011. BeneFit is owned by luxury goods company LVMH, which is run by the world's 13th richest billionaire, Bernard Arnault (pictured) She said customers would confuse her business, The Brow Bar, with BeneFit Brow Bar at Myer stores in Western Australia, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. According to the ruling, Ms Noonan said journalists, media writers and online forum contributors often confused the two. Lawyers for BeneFit told the Australian Trade Marks Office the company had already trademarked the term in Hong Kong and Mexico, and had been using the name in its United States stores since 2003. Hearing officer Nicole Worth said she did not consider the word 'Brow Bar' to be used commonly enough to be deemed as 'generic' as lawyers for BeneFit argued. She added the addition of the word 'BeneFit' to 'Brow Bar' also did not help differentiate the cosmetic giant's services from Ms Noonan's business. 'Additionally, although [BeneFit] did not know of [Ms Noonan's] trademark when it adopted the phrase \"browbar\" in the USA, it is reasonable to expect that it ought to have checked the Australian market for conflicting trade marks before entering it,' Ms Worth said. 'It also continued to expand its business under the [trademark] in the knowledge that a prior conflicting mark was registered and being used... That it did so is a risk it chose to bear.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Noonan for further comment but she did not wish to as BeneFit is appealing the decision. A statement on the matter has also been sought from the cosmetics brand.",

Whatever Villa's Premier League status this summer, Benteke's future will be discussed as his contract, worth \u00a350,000 per week, enters its final two years and the Belgian striker has ambitions to play European football. Wolfsburg have kept tabs on Benteke since before he ruptured his Achilles 12 months ago and remain on the lookout for a striker. The wealthy German club, currently second in Bundesliga, should have funds available from Champions League money, even after their \u00a342million splurge on Chelsea duo Kevin De Bruyne and Andre Schurrle. Christian Benteke celebrates his opening goal against QPR at Villa Park on Tuesday . Villa value their top scorer at \u00a325million however, and even then would remain hugely reluctant to sell with manager Tim Sherwood a big fan. Randy Lerner is set to offload the club come the closed season and new owners will have their own thoughts. A hat-trick by Benteke in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers, capped by a brilliant free-kick, underlined his return to form under Sherwood. He has scored seven goals in his last five Villa games, earning the team an additional three points in the process \u2013 the current gap to the drop zone. Benteke went on to net a hat-trick which salvaged a vital point for his side . But should Villa slip below the dreaded dotted line and out of the Premier League, Benteke is in line for an approximate 30 per cent reduction on his wages to \u00a335,000 a week. The 24-year-old would look to leave Villa Park in that scenario, rather than play in the Championship, with a host of clubs likely to express interest. There is, however, no relegation release clause. Even if Villa stay in the Premier League Benteke will assess his options. Two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to force a move to Tottenham Hotspur following his debut season in England yielding 23 goals. The arrival of Tim Sherwood at Villa Park has rejuvenated Benteke's form in front of goal this season . He signed a new four-year deal on vastly improved terms. Last season was less successful, bringing 11 goals before serious injury struck last April ruling Benteke out of the World Cup. His form suffered on return to the side last October, and at times he cut a bereft figure starved of service under Paul Lambert's regime. Lambert even dropped Benteke in his penultimate game in charge at home to Chelsea. Sherwood's arrival has seen Benteke return to his best, with a goal every 87 minutes. That kind of strike rate should keep Villa up, but also alert top-flight clubs. Spurs are looking to sign young players around the \u00a315million mark, though, while Liverpool would need to shift Mario Balotelli. Jack Grealish is convinced Benteke's goals will ensure Villa's Premier League survival this season . Benteke is comfortable with life in Birmingham and at Villa, but holds desires to play higher up the league and in continental competitions. Qualification for the Europa League is still a possibility through the FA Cup for Villa, of course. Teenage winger Jack Grealish, who started his first Premier League match against QPR, is adamant Benteke will help keep Villa safe. 'Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,' he said. 'We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Spurs) positive. 100 per cent we will stay up.'",

I can remember players left out when I played having a moan in the dressing room and spouting nonsense about how they did not fit in. What Root has done is have a look at himself, stay quiet and then produce hundred after hundred to ensure he will not be left out in a hurry again. Joe Root showed plenty of grit, as well as talent, in yet another big innings for England . Root has bounced back from a difficult Ashes Tour to prove himself as a quality Test batsman . Around four years ago I remember sitting next to Graham Thorpe on a bus journey and him quietly telling me that the young English batsman to watch out for was Joe Root. He was barely heard of then. How right Thorpe was, for what Root has done since Sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke. Do not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour. He is as steely as they come, a fierce competitor who loves playing for England. He tells himself every day that he must enjoy the game but that takes nothing away from the quality of his magnificent performances. His last five hundreds have been in excess of 149, four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with Jimmy Anderson yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain. And he hasn\u2019t messed with his form either. It would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred, as Marlon Samuels did in the first innings here. I love the way Root goes big. Before his partner was foolishly run out, Root showed maturity to bat with the tail on Friday in Grenada . The young batsman has been superb in his middle-order role, and should not be moved up the batting card . Part of me sees Root as a natural No 3, where England tried him in Australia. He looks like a batsman who could come in and regain the initiative if you lose an early wicket. But why move him when he is going so well at five? Keep him there. Eventually he will captain England and five is a good place to captain from. The only problem in seeing him as a future England captain is that do we want to put our best player in charge when his runs are so important? Look at Alastair Cook and just about every England captain in history. It wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that England need a new leader they will have to think about that. His fabulous form should be enough to see Root left to do what he does best - score runs for England . Alastair Cook (right) has shown the danger of making your best player the captain of the team . I have enjoyed the battle between Ben Stokes and Samuels in this Test and I like the way the Durham lad goes about his cricket. The fact he gave Mitchell Johnson a send-off when he got him out in Australia speaks volumes for him and he\u2019ll never take a backward step. I generally don\u2019t like send-offs. Once a batsman is out you have done your job so why point to the dressing room or swear at someone? But I enjoyed what Samuels did on the third evening. If you are going to do it, make it humorous and non-threatening like that salute. Stokes will have to take it. If you dish it out you have to take it back. Stokes shouldn\u2019t go too far, though. I saw Peter Moores take him to one side for a chat before play yesterday and that might have been to say: \u2018Be careful. Don\u2019t lose your passion but don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u2019",

Guardiola, who spent four trophy-filled years at Barcelona, took over at Bayern in 2013. In the other semi-final, defending champion Real Madrid will face Juventus, with the Italian champions playing at home first. The four teams have combined to win the European Cup or Champions League 21 times, with 16 runner-up finishes, in the competition's 60-year history. The first legs will be played on May 5-6, with the return matches on May 12-13. The final will be played on June 6 at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. Here's how the draw unfolded... Host commentator . How about that, then? Pep Guardiola will return to the Nou Camp in the semi-finals with his Bayern Munich team. Many would have wanted this as the final. Personally, I think it's much better that Pep goes back to Catalunya rather than a final at a neutral venue. Real Madrid vs Juventus is the other tie. The possibility of an El Clasico final and a second straight all Spanish final on June 6 is still there. That's all from me this morning, though. Goodbye. BARCELONA vs BAYERN MUNICH . JUVENTUS vs REAL MADRID . Ties to be played on May 5/6 and May 12/13 . REAL MADRID . JUVENTUS . BAYERN MUNICH . BARCELONA . Napoli will play Dnipro and Sevilla will face Fiorentina in the semi-finals of the Europa League. That draw has just been made. Time for the main event, then. Don't blink... this will be quick. We're all ready for the draw to to start then. UEFA will make the Europa League semi-final draw first. Join me HERE for live coverage of that before the main event shortly after. It's been everything you'd expect from Barcelona really. They topped their group ahead of PSG before Christmas and have made light work of Manchester City and the French champions in the knockout rounds. Whatsmore, they are starting to look like the team to beat around Europe again and that front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar are awesome. PSG are the team who knocked Chelsea out, but Barcelona dismantled them 5-1 in the quarter-finals. It was all plain sailing for Pep Guardiola's side, right up until their quarter-final tie with Porto that is. Bayern set off in their quest to regain the title they won at Wembley in 2013 by topping a tough Group E, which featured Manchester City, Roma and CSKA Moscow, with five wins out of six. They showed no signs of letting up in the last 16 as well, thrashing Shakhtar 7-0 at the Allianz Arena. But the last eight was a different story. Bayern fell to a shock 3-1 defeat in Porto in the first leg and needed something close to a miracle to go through. What they got was five goals in a sensational first half on their way to a 6-1 second leg victory. Today, they could be drawn against Real Madrid, as they were last year, or Pep Guardiola could return to the Nou Camp to take on Barcelona. Juventus are by far the least glamorous side left in this season's Champions League. They are well on their way to another Serie A title, and their European campaign this season has been just as efficient if a tad unspectacular. Juve finished second in Group A behind Atletico Madrid, just edging Olympiacos into third place. But their 5-1 aggregate thrashing of Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 went under the radar, as did their 1-0 win over Arsenal's conquerors Monaco in the previous round. Juventus are a team not used to losing many games, and will be a tough draw for either of the other three sides. It's been a season of two halves for Real Madrid, and their path to the last four of the Champions League is a perfect reflection of that. The 2014 winners were an unstoppable force before Christmas and won 22 games in a row in all competitions, including all six matches in a group that featured Liverpool, Basle and Ludogorets. It's been a different story in 2015, though, and their progress through the knock-out rounds has been far from convincing. In the last 16 they were made to hang on by Schalke, who inflicted a shock 4-3 defeat at the Bernabeu after Real cruised into a 2-0 lead in the away leg. In the last round, an 88th-minute strike from Javier Hernandez was all that separated them and local rivals Atletico Madrid. With the La Liga title race firmly in Barcelona's hands, Real will once again be looking to the Champions League for success this season. LAURIE WHITWELL: Sorry Pep, but Barcelona vs Real Madrid is the dream Champions League final . It's a pretty tough question to answer... so we picked the brains of our team of experts. As you can see, even our reporters can't even agree... OUR REPORTERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON WHO WILL WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . Plenty of build-up to this morning's draw on the front pages of the national press in both Spain and Italy. The feeling in Spain is that Juventus are the team to draw. AS have also listed the number of times each of these four teams have won the trophy - 21 cups between them from 37 finals. The Italian press seem to have a 'bring it on' message for Juventus. They also look forward to Fiorentina and Napoli in the Europa League draw a little later. Ahead of today's draw, our live football man Dan Ripley has compiled an ultimate lowdown on each of the four teams remaining in the draw. You've still got time, so why not have a read... As Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus meet in the Champions League semi-finals, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on the final four . This morning, then, we will move one step closer to discovering our line-up for the final of this year's Champions League final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on June 6. The first leg of the semi-finals will take place on May 5/6 with the second leg a week later on May 12/13 and, regardless of today's draw, we should have some intriguing scenarios. Will Suarez have to face either Chiellini or Evra again? Will Pep come up against his former team? Will Bayern face Real Madrid as they did last year? Or will we have a home and away El Clasico tie to look forward to? All will be revealed, I guess. Good morning everybody. I'm sure you'll agree it's not a bad way to start a Friday by finding out the line-up for this year's semi-finals of the Champions League. There may be no English involvement, but don't let that get you down. Featured in this morning's draw in Nyon are four European powerhouses Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus. The draw at UEFA's HQ in Switzerland will take place in around an hour from now, but we'll have plenty of build-up so don't move your mouse.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nIt is a common fear, known as trypanophobia. For around 20 per cent of the population, the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep-rooted sense of dread. Many avoid the doctor's surgery altogether, leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections. But for those terrified of needles, a team of scientists at Rice University in Houston, may have the answer. They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin. Scroll down for video . Comfortably Numb is a new, single-use device that eases the pain of an injection by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin within 60 seconds . Three first year students, (from L-R) mechanical engineer Mike Hua, bioengineer Andy Zhang and computer scientist Greg Allison, came up with the invention, they describe as 'simple and elegant' The trio, made up of computer scientist Greg Allison, bioengineer Andy Zhang and mechanical engineer Mike Hua, currently has a functioning prototype, that has produced a numbing effect in just 60 seconds. 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' Current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately, or take too long, the researchers said. They noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work, whereas their new device 'works on the order of seconds and minutes', Mr Zhang said. 'We are targeting anyone who has to get an injection, which is nearly everyone,' Mr Allison said. 'But the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain.' As such, he said, it is particularly useful for children and the elderly. And, it is intended for use during procedures 'where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body, such as the face or the groin', he added. The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (\u00a31.34) to produce, they said . The trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing, and help reduce swelling. 'We looked into all sorts of methods for numbing, both quick and long-term, chemicals, using ice packs - which is similar to what we're using now,' Mr Hua said. The device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water. A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'We explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming.' 'At the end of the day, what we're creating is a self-contained device with a very cold contact surface, and there are many applications for that,' Mr Allison added. Some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree, or skills the first-year students had not yet learned. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. 'Because we don't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas, that meant we had to think of very simple solutions. 'Being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative, but at the same time, simple and elegant.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. Mr Zhang, said: 'The materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance: plastic, rubber and metal. The team from Rice University in Houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos, or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain . 'The materials for one of these cost about a quarter, and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost. 'We compared our device to similar things already in production, and we've estimated the cost at about $2 (\u00a31.34).' The team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device, and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to Rice in their second year. 'As a team, we just want to follow the project, because we think it has a lot of potential. I think that's what drew us to this specific project,' Mr Allison said. 'We haven't really discussed yet whether we're going dedicate to making this a company, but it's something we're open to.'",

The brolly-clad thieves targeted supermarkets, convenience stores and electrical shops, swiping \u00a32,000 worth of cigarettes and cars valued at \u00a330,000 in the process. CCTV footage from one of the raids in Tipton, West Midlands, shows the gang using umbrellas to conceal their entrance as they burst into a supermarket, where they stole cash from the offices. Scroll down for video . Umbrella thieves: A gang of armed robbers used pink brollies to confuse staff as they raided 13 shops in a two-month crime spree in the West Midlands . The gang  also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives and screwdrivers, before punching one employee in the face. In a separate raid, the men stole the store manager's Mercedes E200 which they used as their getaway car. The group have now been jailed for more than 27 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob. Police caught the thieves following a raid on an Asda supermarket in Coseley, West Midlands, where they were armed with hammers and what was reported to be a gun in a plastic bag. Detectives then used forensic evidence found on the weapon to link the various burglaries, before executing search warrants on the homes of the four suspects. During the searches, police found fluorescent jackets, identical to those used in the raids, along with banks statements showing large transfers of cash. Armed:\u00a0The gang also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives, golf clubs and screwdrivers . They also discovered numerous cash bags from a shop known as Farmfords, one of those targeted by the group, as well as \u00a32,500 in cash. Mobile phones found at the addresses also showed several calls made between the group, while number plate analysis linked the defendants to the areas where the crimes had been committed. Liam Bell, 19, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, and 22-year-old Trea Richardson, from Hansworth, were arrested in June last year, at the time of the warrants being executed. Marcus Morgan, 21, from Tividale, West Midlands, went on the run for five months before being detained in November. Guilty: Ashleigh Evans, 26 (left) from West Bromwich and Marcus Morgan, 21 (right) from Tividale, West Midlands, were jailed for ten years and seven years respectively for their parts in the 13 robberies . Jailed: Liam Bell, 19 (left), from Rowley Regis was jailed for six years and six months while Trea Richardson, 22 (right) from Hansowrth, was sentened to a four-year jail term . Ashleigh Evans, 26, from West Bromwich, was arrested on a flight back from Amsterdam. Officers even found the umbrella captured on CCTV in his luggage. On Friday, Evans was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Bell was jailed for six years and six months. Richardson received a four-year jail term while Morgan was sentenced to seven years. Sentencing Morgan, Recorder William Mousley QC said to Morgan: 'No doubt you would have seen the fear in the eyes of the people you were robbing yet you carried on thereafter. 'It was not a one-off, it was a course of conduct you decided to engage in quite freely for a few weeks. 'This was professional, commercial robbery for significant financial gain where people were disguised and premises targeted that were vulnerable where people worked hard for not much money. 'They were not the type of premises where workers would expect people like you to come in and rob the store. The only mitigation I can find other than your guilty plea is your youth.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Rich Whitehouse, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The money and value of goods stolen, while significant, is nothing compared to the impact these offences have had on the staff members of the targeted premises. 'These offences were carefully planned and the group went to great lengths to conceal their involvement, often using umbrellas as cover when walking from the street to the shops, so as not to draw attention to their face coverings. 'However, the more offences they committed the more arrogant they became. There was also a clear escalation in the type of weapons used in the robberies and I am in no doubt they would have gone on to seriously hurt someone had they not been stopped.'",

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

The 21-year-old became somewhat infamous late last year for video of him screaming 'I don't like mens no more - I like women, women, women!' after a pastor at an evangelical megachurch claimed to have cured his homosexuality. Caldwell hit headlines in November after the footage surfaced of him being 'delivered' by God. But he says he was attacked by an employee at a FroYo in Delmar on Wednesday after the cashier recognized him. He ended up completely doused in his own dessert at the counter. 'I filled (the bowl) all the way up to the top - I had some Kit Kats, I had some Reese's on it,' Caldwell told STL Today. 'It was all all in my face, on my clothes, in my shoes.' Scroll down for video . Unhappy viewer: This is the moment St. Louis FroYo cashier Stephanie Diaz (green shirt) throws a bowl of yogurt in the face of Andrew Caldwell, a man who found internet fame for saying God cured his homosexuality . Doused in dessert: Caldwell claimed Diaz attacked him because she disagreed with his ideals about being 'cured'. However Diaz said he demanded a discount and called her a 'dog' Heated confrontation over frozen yogurt: Caldwell was covered in FroYo, and said his bowl was extra large . Megachurch star:\u00a0Andrew Caldwell in a still from a video of him speaking during a Church of God in Christ Convention in St. Louis last year, where he infamously said he 'don't like mens no more' Caldwell claims the employee recognized him from his video at the Church of God in Christ's 107th Holy Convocation. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. \u2026 I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story . Scene: The incident occurred Wednesday at his FroYo store in Delmar, St.Louis . Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell. She has been charged with third-degree assault. However Diaz has not been fired. FroYo have said any punishment that should occur from the incident will be handled internally. Stylish: Caldwell is pictured here dressed in head-to-toe designer clothing on his Facebook page . Caldwell says he is considering suing Diaz and FroYo. In he video of Caldwell being 'delivered' that went viral, he announces into the microphone: 'I\u2019m not gay no more! I am delivered! I don\u2019t like mens no more! I said I like women! Women, women, women! I said women! I\u2019m not gay! I will not date a man! I will not carry a purse! I will not put on makeup! I will love a woman.' The megachurch audience can be heard screaming and cheering in the background, congratulating Caldwell on no longer being gay. The pastor then hands him $100, saying the Lord told him to. After the video spread, Caldwell - who was extravagantly dressed in a paisley suit, purple shirt and mustard bow tie - did a series of interviews, where he said he meant what he said, but was unhappy the video became so popular. He said he did not want to get in front of the church to begin with, but believes his homosexuality no longer exists .",

Oleg Maidanovich said someone was hiding satellites as space junk (artist's illustration of a satellite shown). But in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse . The claims were made by the commander of Russian Space Command, Oleg Maidanovich. He was speaking on a film called \u2018Space Special Forces\u2019 during a tour of Russia\u2019s main centre for aerospace intelligence in Krasnoznamensk, near Moscow. \u2018Very recently, specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites... made for radio-technical reconnaissance of equipment on Russian territory,\u2019 he said. A reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite. They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes. Some are used to simply take images from the ground, while others relay information from one place to another. Many such satellites are used today for high-resolution photography of certain areas, for scientific or defense purposes. The film goes on to state that there \u2018are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment.\u2019 The comments were made yesterday on \u2018Space Day\u2019, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. Since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space \u2013 and Russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit. Their Space Command is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling Russia's defence satellites. It monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet, out of a total of 100,000 significant objects. Some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it\u2019s not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are. MailOnline has asked the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) and Space Command for further information on the claim.

Valbona Yzeiraj was arrested on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to charges of assault, unauthorized practice of a profession and reckless endangerment. Authorities said the 45-year-old woman, from White Plains, did injections in people's mouths, performed root canals and on several occasions pulled patients' teeth. Valbona Yzeiraj was arrested on Thursday (pictured right) and pleaded not guilty to charges of assault after she illegally posed as dentist 'Dr Val' and pulled patients' teeth out at a practice in Riverdale, New York . According to CBS, she called herself 'Dr Val', putting on a lab coat when her boss, Dr Jeffrey Schoengold, wasn't present and doing dental work on unsuspecting patients. Dr Schoengold became suspicious when at least four people complained over work he had not done. One patient suffered an infection from a botched root canal and another patient was left with pain two years on from a procedure, CBS reported. Prosecutors said she was fired from Ultimate Dental Care of Riverdale after the company found out she was performing as a dentist from late 2012 to summer 2013. It is then alleged that she tried to steal from the practice. The company hasn't returned a message left seeking comment. Yzeiraj's attorney didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Bail has been set at $20,000 bond and the 45-year-old was due back in court on May 28. She claimed to have dental training in her native Albania but authorities said she had no license in the U.S. Yzeiraj was fired from Ultimate Dental Care of Riverdale, New York (pictured) after the company found out she was illegally performing as a dentist from late 2012 to summer 2013 .",

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'",

McCall has put Rangers in the driving seat for second place in the Scottish Championship and a place in the semi-finals of the play-offs after taking over from reluctant caretaker Kenny McDowall. McCoist was put on gardening leave just before Christmas after handing in his notice following three-and-a-half difficult seasons in charge under the chaotic reigns of the likes of Craig Whyte and then Charles Green and his allies. But his failure to win a cup competition and his team's style of play drew serious criticism. Walter Smith (right)\u00a0spent two spells in charge as manager of Rangers and has hailed Stuart McCall's impact . Smith (right) attended a John Hartson Foundation golf day to raise money for testicular cancer awareness . Smith was chairman for some of that period after accepting Green's offer to join the board - a decision he soon regretted - and insists the club was too badly run to ensure true success on the park. Smith, who was attending a John Hartson Foundation golf day to help raise money for testicular cancer awareness, said: 'The guys worked with me for four-and-a-half years there and did a great job for the club, and I was hoping they would get a good opportunity. 'I got great support from Sir David Murray but it's not turned out that they have had the same support from the people who have been running the club. So it has been very difficult for them to show what they can do. 'That's the crux of the matter, it's the circumstances they have been in that have caused them as much trouble as anything else. 'I'd be very surprised if anybody could show me a club that isn't well run, that are doing really well. 'The problems have been well documented and now they have got to concentrate on doing what they do, and that's Rangers getting back to the Premiership first and foremost and then trying to settle into a position where they can get back to being a winning team.' McCall played under Smith for seven seasons, winning six titles in the process, and the 67-year-old was pleased to see the former Motherwell boss take over, despite his pain at the exits of former assistants McCoist and McDowall. McCall was appointed Rangers manager in March until the summer as a replacement for Kenny McDowall . 'I'm not happy to see it because it cost friends of mine their job,' he said. 'But that happens in football and when other people take over I am obviously pleased to see Stuart take over and I hope he does really well. 'He has been brave enough to take the job until the end of the season. If he gets promotion, he will put himself in a very good position to get the job on a more permanent basis. 'He has gone in there and got a reaction. That happens in football. It has happened to me and a whole load of other managers, when you leave and someone else comes in, they get a reaction. Rangers have won five out of nine Scottish Championship matches since McCall's arrival at Ibrox . 'Performances have been brighter and hopefully he will keep that going until the end of the season.' However, Smith has warned that Rangers fans might have to be patient in their desire to see the club competing at the very top of Scottish football, despite power now lying in the hands of the likes of Paul Murray and Dave King following last month's general meeting. 'I'm obviously happy to see everything at the club settling down,' the former Scotland boss said. 'The lack of headlines would indicate that's the case. 'The people that are running the club are just getting their feet under the table and finding out what they have to do to move the club forward. I think that's to be expected at this stage. Smith did, however, open up about Ally McCoist's departure and admitted it wasn't easy to see . 'It will obviously take a bit of time but they will be able to handle that aspect of it. Everyone who is there now is there for the football club and that's a big, big thing. 'To be fair, when I was involved on the Rangers board, it would have been different from any other boardroom never mind anything else. 'I have been fortunate enough to be at Rangers for a long time and be there at successful times and it's not a period I can look back on with any great pleasure.'",

Mourinho was having no truck with the Barclays Premier League's Fair Play table, which lauded the Hammers for their attacking style and frowned upon Chelsea's lack of respect. He dismissed it as a joke. He was relaxed ahead of a visit from Manchester United. He even offered support to Manuel Pellegrini, claiming the Manchester City boss had been treated like a 'criminal' after losing six of eight games. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spoken out in defence of under pressure colleague Manuel Pellegrini . Pellegrini has overseen a poor run of form at Manchester City, losing six of their last eight games . Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero (left) tussles for the ball with Manchester United's Marcos Rojo . United defender Chris Smalling scores his side's fourth goal as they beat City 4-2 at Old Trafford last week . Pellegrini poses with Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (left) after winning the league last season . No love is lost between Mourinho and Pellegrini, but the Chelsea manager said: 'I'm surprised a team that won two titles in three years and are still champions can be brought to hell. 'It looks like they don't deserve respect, that they are bad players, that the manager is a bad manager, that they are a disaster. But they are the champions. 'You want lots of teams fighting for the title. 'So how can you be so negative with a team that's won two titles in three years? Some managers cannot win and life goes on, but the guys at Man City... it looks like they're criminals.' Victory on Saturday will extend Chelsea's lead over United to 11 points and inch Mourinho closer to his first Premier League title since 2006, having led from the start. 'We are boring, top of the league since day one,' said the Portuguese. 'Everyone would love the Premier League to be like the Championship, with four teams separated by a couple of points. 'I know this would be the ideal scenario, but since day one we are there. We are trying not to allow that to happen. We have big determination to be champions.' As for the Fair Play table, well, he couldn't care less. It is compiled using data from Premier League delegates who mark teams in six categories. The conduct of Chelsea's players towards match officials is rated the worst in the league and only Sunderland score worse when it comes to the behaviour of staff. 'I'm not surprised,' chuckled Mourinho. 'These delegates are the same delegates who do the evaluation of the referees' performances and I read them every week. 'I think it depends on the food and drink. We have to change the catering because we have the best and many times they don't see the games. Next season, bread and water.'

It's the day after the fat has been cut and the big dogs make their move up -- or occasionally down -- the leader board. Players rose and players fell away on Moving Day at the 2015 Masters. Rory McIlroy went out in 32 and briefly raised the crowd's hopes that he had a sniff of completing an improbable Grand Slam on Sunday night. But he dropped two shots late on in the round to finish six under par. Woods comeback? A rejuvenated Tiger Woods showed touches of his old class mixed with the ragged unpredictability that has marked his new game to finish six under too. A huge improvement, but still a long way from him wearing the green jacket again. \"It could have been a super low today,\" a disappointed Woods said after his round. \"All in all. It should have been two shots better.\" Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place. In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth. Infallible . The 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta. His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round. That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win. Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997. As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round. When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17. Echos of 1996? When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible. \"It really is,\" he said. \"We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions.\" He is, of course, right. As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day. But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown. Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope. Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead. He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.",

That's not the case today. Incredibly, the last four mangers to have won the Premier League have all left their jobs by the following year \u2013 three sacked and one retired. And on the latest evidence, it will be no surprise if Manuel Pellegrini becomes number five this summer. A dejected Manuel Pellegrini following Manchester City's 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday night . Pellegrini guided City to their second Premier League title in three seasons back in May . But Pellegrini's City side were humbled at Selhurst Park on Monday to kill off any remaining title hopes . City sit fourth after the defeat, nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea, who retain a game in hand . WIN THE LEAGUE..AND THEN OUT . JOSE MOURINHO (CHELSEA) Won Premier League in 2006; sacked 2007 . Jose Mourinho ended Chelsea's 50-year wait to be champions by winning the Premier League in his first season 2004/05, and then retained the trophy the following season. But as his reputation soared, his relationship with owner Roman Abramovich soured and he left in September 2007 despite having three years left on his contract. Despite domestic success, Abramovich craved the Champions League and had become frustrated with the team's defensive style. For his part, Mourinho felt belittled by having players signed on Abramovich's say-so, most notably Andriy Shevchenko who was a declining force. Mourinho celebrates winning back-to-back Premier League titles with Chelsea in 2006 . Mourinho departed Stamford Bridge the following year, despite having three years left on his contract . CARLO ANCELOTTI (CHELSEA) Won PL in 2010; sacked 2011 . Carlo Ancelotti led Chelsea to their first league and FA Cup Double in his first season, scoring a record number of goals that still stands today. However, he failed to win a trophy in his second season and that was enough for Abramovich to pull the trigger despite finishing second in the table. Ancelotti knew the game was up as he puffed on a cigarette and chatted to David Moyes after Chelsea had lost the final game of the season 1-0 at Everton. The Italian bounced back to win the Champions League with Real Madrid last season and will be among the contenders for the City job should Pellegrini leave. Carlo Ancelotti celebrates with the Premier League trophy after Chelsea secured the title in 2010 . Ancelotti departed Stamford Bridge a year later after failing to win silverware in his second season . ROBERTO MANCINI (MANCHESTER CITY) Won PL in 2012; sacked 2013 . Mancini ended City's 44-year wait for the league title when Sergio Aguero scored against QPR on the final minute of the final day of the season. Yet his controversial approach led to him falling out with Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli, and criticising Adam Johnson and Joe Hart, and when City failed to win a trophy the following season and failed in the Champions League, the Italian was out. His demise was widely reported on the morning of the FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic. City fans chanted Mancini's name but they lost the final and he was dismissed the following week. Roberto Mancini celebrates with the Premier League trophy as Man City win the league in 2012 . Mancini waves goodbye after being sacked by Manchester City 12 months after the title win . SIR ALEX FERGUSON (MANCHESTER UNITED) Won PL in 2013; retired in 2013 . The only one of the managers who left on his own terms. Ferguson won a record 13th title and walked away into the sunset after the final game of the season, a remarkable 5-5 draw at West Brom. The United boss said later he had wanted to retire the previous season but City's title win persuaded him to carry on for another year and wrestle the trophy back \u2013 which he did. Ferguson helped pick David Moyes as his successor but he grew disillusioned with his fellow Scot after Moyes got rid of his assistant Mike Phelan and built a team around Wayne Rooney. Sir Alex Ferguson led Manchester United to their 13th Premier League title in 2013 before retiring . Ferguson salutes the fans after his final game in charge at United - \u00a0a 5-5 draw with West Brom in 2013 . MANUEL PELLEGRINI (MANCHESTER CITY) Won PL in 2014, ??? The Chilean followed Mourinho and Ancelotti in winning the Premier League in his first season and also lifted the Capital One Cup as Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure in particular shone. But this season has been a major disappointment. City crashed out of the Capital One Cup, FA Cup and Champions League early and currently stand fourth in the Premier League. The knives are out.",

They say the results show just how modern lifestyles and diets have changed us - \u00a0and that the  bacteria they found could be\u00a0potentially beneficial to modern society. Researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are an indigenous ethnic group in the Amazonian region of South America. There are about 26,000 Yanomami living in Brazil and 15,000 in Venezuela, mostly in federally protected reserves near rivers and in remote mountains. The Yanomami are hunter-gatherers. They gather wild bananas, seasonal fruits, palm hearts and cassava. They hunt birds, small mammals, crabs, frogs, small fish and the occasional peccary, monkey or tapir. The group doesn't grow food or domesticate livestock. The researchers found that Yanomami people harbor microbiomes with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. 'That tells us that Western diets and lifestyles have a great impact on our microbiomes', experts at University of San Diego said. 'Studying the microbiomes of people in remote areas may hold the key to understanding microbes we have lost through antibiotics, sealed buildings and lack of exposure to the outdoors,' said study co-author Rob Knight. In the new study published April 17 by Science Advances, researchers sequenced the microbiomes of Yanomami people living in a remote Amazon village in Venezuela who had not had previous contact with non-Yanomami. This information revealed, for the first time, the species of bacteria that co-exist with people who have never been exposed to industrialized society, including Western food and antibiotics. 'Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body,' the researchers wrote. Many Yanomami now regularly interact with Western civilization through trade, but some villages have never had contact with non-Yanomami people. One such unmapped village was first spotted by an army helicopter passing overhead in 2008. In 2009, a medical mission landed there. As part of their 2009 visit to this previously uncontacted Yanomami village, medical professionals collected samples from the skin, mouths and fecal matter of 34 of the 54 villagers before vaccines or antibiotics were administered. The samples were frozen until DNA extraction and bacterial culturing could be performed for the purposes of this study. Yanomami indigenous leader Davi Yanomami claims Americans' 'robbed blood' for the tests . Thousands of blood samples have been returned to the Yanomami tribe in Brazil, after they were taken by American scientists in the 1960s and held in U.S. academic institutions without the tribe's consent, according to Survival international. The Yanomami have been fighting for their return for over a decade. The Yanomami buried the 2,693 samples during a special funerary ceremony presided over by shamans in the Yanomami community where many of the samples were collected. Only 15 Yanomami whose blood was taken in the late 1960s were able to attend the ritual. Shamans performed funerary rites for those who gave blood and have since died. Keen to collect blood samples from a very isolated community, U.S. scientists collected thousands of samples from the Indians in Brazil and Venezuela without obtaining their informed consent. The Yanomami only discovered years later that their blood was being stored in research institutes \u2013 in violation of their beliefs and funerary customs of cremating those who have passed away and destroying their possessions. Without obtaining the Yanomami's consent, some institutions extracted DNA from the blood for genetic tests in the 1990s. Yanomami spokesman Davi Kopenawa said, 'These Americans robbed our blood. 'They did not say anything in our language about the tests they were going to do. Nobody knew that they were going to use our blood to do research.' Back in labs in the U.S. (at Mount Sinai, New York University, University of Colorado, Boulder and others), researchers sequenced DNA isolated from the Yanomami samples. From this, they were able to identify all of the bacterial species that make up the skin, mouth and gut microbiomes of people who had never been exposed to Western diets, antibiotics or other environmental factors that make up life in industrialized societies. The researchers then compared these non-Westernized microbiomes to the microbiomes of people living in Western society and people living in villages in the midst of transition from isolation to urban lifestyles. Bacteria isolated from Yanomami microbiomes carried genes that confer resistance to man-made antibiotics, despite the fact that they were never previously exposed to antibiotics. This finding suggests that many bacterial species contain antibiotic resistance genes naturally, even without the selective pressure of antibiotic use. What happens in Western cultures, the researchers hypothesize, is antibiotic use simply gives naturally resistant bacteria a survival advantage over non-resistant bacteria. The researchers say the study could help develop new medical treatments. 'First of all, this study gives us a glimpse of what our microbiomes might have looked like before our modern habits began to impact the beneficial bacteria that call us home. 'Studies like this one help us better understand what factors can alter a microbiome and the effect those changes can have on a person's health \u2014 information researchers need to guide efforts to manipulate the microbiome to treat disease and restore health.'",

An 18-month-old baby and three girls - aged three, six and eight - were trapped on a sandbank at Blackpool Beach while out walking during the school break. But when it was obvious they had found themselves in trouble, those perched on the nearby pier did nothing to help - instead, they took out their smartphones to record the drama. Two mothers saved the lives of three girls and a baby after the youngsters were trapped by the rising tide . The Mirror reported the two mothers held the baby and young girls' heads above the rising tide until volunteer lifeboats reached them. Lifeboat crew member Nathan Lee told the paper: 'They thought they were going to die. One mum was disgusted people were filming it all on cameras, not helping. 'A few more minutes and none of them would be here.' The incident serves as just another reminder of the dangers of rising tides after more than 60 spectators had to be rescued at the Boat Race in London on Saturday. Lifeboats were deployed to transport the onlookers from the shore after they became trapped on the edge of the River Thames. Video footage showed a group of at least 40 people stranded by the rising waters after watching the rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge universities. A boy, reportedly eight years old, was also rescued from an embankment after he became separated from his mother, while seven people were evacuated from Chiswick Eyot when they were cut off by the rising tide. The RNLI said it was a 'surprise' to find so many spectators in trouble and the number was 'significantly greater' than in previous years. Many were unaware that they would be exposed to the substantial wash from the flotilla following the races and from the rising tide, it said. As a result many were cut off and found themselves with limited options to reach higher ground. Chiswick RNLI station manager Wayne Bellamy said: 'This incident showed once more that the tidal Thames can catch people unaware.'

Bethany Farrell, 23, from Essex, died on February 17 while in Queensland's Whitsundays, a week into her dream gap-year when she went scuba diving for the first time. Two people who were on the boat when Ms Farrell died have taken to TripAdvisor to slam Wings Diving Adventures for the way they handled the tragic circumstances. While one of the reviews criticises the way people on the boat were treated amid the panic, a friend makes the shocking claim that photos of the backpacker shortly before she died were deleted. The backpacker's father is devastated that picture evidence, which may have been able to explain some of the mystery behind the drowning, was discarded before police could see it. British backpacker Bethany Farrell, 23, died on February 17 while scuba diving in Queensland's Whitsundays . 'There is no excuse,' Bethany's father Patrick Farrell, 47, told the Courier Mail. 'Grave mistakes have been made. Ultimately her life was in their hands. Now she\u2019s dead.' Ms Farrell drowned on her first ever scuba dive\u00a0after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year. She was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. A post mortem determined the cause of death was drowning. Last week a number of reviews from distressed fellow travellers - who were on the charter when Ms Farrell died - emerged, slamming the tour guides' handling of the situation and claiming photographs were deliberately deleted. 'What was supposed to be a dream trip turned into the worst possible nightmare,' one user wrote. The same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of Ms Farrell with others before the dive, but when they contacted Wings Diving Adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted. Scathing reviews have been posted to TripAdvisor slamming the\u00a0Wings Diving Adventures charter boat operators and claiming they deleted photographs of Ms Farrell . The young woman was just one week into gap year in Australia when she tragically drowned . Ms Farrell was on her first scuba diving trip when she tragically drowned near Blue Pearl Bay (pictured) 'We got in contact with wings solely because they had pictures their staff had taken of the three of us before the dive. Wings deleted these pictures to make way for pictures of their next trip.... despite the likelihood of the police wanting those pictures as evidence,' the review also read. 'Wings have made no effort in contacting our friend's family to express their condolences, we feel they are an absolute disgrace.' Another diver also on the same boat made similar claims, saying the people on the boat were left without any information for a number of hours after the incident which claimed Ms Farrell's life. 'The girl who had the accident was found dead, and what's worst is that I now know that they deleted all of the pictures that had been taken on the boat before they could give it to the girl's family or police,' another review claimed. 'This is destruction of evidence, and I want to make sure that Wings does not get away with this,' the traveller continued. This report was written by a distressed woman who was on the boat when Ms Farrell drowned. Wings refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia . Ms Farrell (not pictured)\u00a0was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay in the Whitsundays . When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Wings Diving Adventures declined to comment on the incident, or whether any photographs had been deleted. Queensland police said they could not comment on specific elements of the investigation. Ms Farrell's father said he was not going on a 'witch hunt' but was desperate to get the truth about his daughter's death and the photographs. 'I don\u2019t want to go on a witch hunt. But this will go to an inquest. We\u2019re heartbroken and will do anything to get to the truth,' he told the Courier Mail. The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death. Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell\u2019s mother Caron, said at the time: \u2018The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends. \u2018At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help. \u2018They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.\u2019 The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell\u2019s death are fully understood. Ms Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there. She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17. The case is still being investigated by Queensland Police, who will hand a report over to the coroner.",

The High Court threw out rules introduced to stop violent prisoners being transferred out of high-security jails. The policy was brought in after fugitive armed robber Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker \u2013 walked out of an open jail in May while on day release  despite a history of prison escapes. Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker \u2013 walked out of an open jail in May while on day release and went on to commit an armed robbery which was caught on CCTV (left) Wheatley absconding from Standford Hill prison in Kent  and went on a robbing spree \u2013 pulling a handgun on staff at the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. After being caught he was told that he must serve at least eight years in jail before becoming eligible to apply for release on parole. The violent thug had previously been handed 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002 and earned his nickname by pistol-whipping his victims. Following the scandal, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling publicly announced that the Government was 'tearing up the system as it exists at the moment' and introduced his absconder policy. But two senior judges at London's High Court have ruled that excluding transfers  for prisoners with a history of absconding was unlawful. Wheatley was eligible for release after eight years, had been on the run after leaving Standford Hill open prison in Kent on day release and failing to return. He was arrested alongside another man in Tower Hamlets, east London, after an armed robbery at a Chelsea Building Society branch in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. The Ministry of Justice today announced they would appeal against the ruling. New rules were introduced after  Wheatley walked out of an open jail in May while on day release last year despite a history of prison escapes . A spokesman said: 'The fundamental principles of the policy are not unlawful. The court found there was inconsistency with the implementation. 'Our position remains that temporary release can be an important part of rehabilitating offenders but not at the cost of public protection. We are appealing this decision.' But the Prisoners' Advice Service, a charity offering free legal advice and support to adult prisoners, described the absconder policy as a 'knee jerk reaction' by Mr Grayling. The charity said in a statement: 'The Secretary of State's contention that he is entitled to ignore and contradict his own policy guidance demonstrates either his ignorance or flagrant disregard for basic legal principles of consistency and transparency in public decision making. 'The so called 'absconder policy' was introduced as a knee jerk reaction to negative press reports without adequate consideration for either existing policies, or its impact on the prisoners whose progression to open conditions was abruptly prevented.'",

(Chatto & Windus \u00a316.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker\u2019s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our \u2018historic relationship with aviation\u2019. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights \u2014 exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia\u2019s great blue heron as \u2018the 747 of the swamp\u2019 and notes how this would delight the aircraft\u2019s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more \u2018a place\u2019 than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the \u2018frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better \u2014 everything looks better \u2014 when your feet are warm\u2019. He writes elegantly about his pilot\u2019s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth\u2019s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And \u2018meet\u2019 really means \u2018meet\u2019: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, \u2018our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.\u2019 Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there\u2019s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as \u2018Klingons\u2019. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as \u2018the heavy\u2019, one acting as \u2018heavy out\u2019, the other as \u2018heavy home\u2019. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker\u2019s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region\u2019s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city\u2019s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker\u2019s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics\u2019 singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls.",

There is a tall glass of something very red and rather alarming on the kitchen counter when I meet Kathryn Beale at her three-bedroom home in Swindon. More scary still, she appears to be drinking it. Fortunately it soon becomes clear that my suspicions are unwarranted, as the substance in the tumbler is nothing more troubling than plain old fruit juice. But I am here because Kathryn is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff, and one very disconcerting product in particular. The 41-year-old mother-of-two is part of a rapidly growing cottage industry that prepares fresh placenta for new mothers. Along with some 60 other specialists in this country, she whizzes it into smoothies, or grinds it into pills for women convinced of its health benefits. Mothers have reported powerful healing properties, saying that eating their own placenta (the blood-filled organ that supports the foetus in the womb) has helped to increase their milk supply, reduce post-natal bleeding, stabilise blood pressure, and, crucially, provide them with more energy to care for their babies. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Hollywood actresses January Jones and Alicia Silverstone and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton. Kathryn has had no reported cases of food poisoning among her clients. Nor, for that matter, has any other practitioner in the 70-strong Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network (IPEN), of which Kathryn is a member. IPEN estimates that between 4,000 and 5,000 women have used the service since it started in 2010, the majority in Britain. Yet Kathryn is in despair, having found herself at the centre of a storm which could not only destroy her own business, but help put an end to placenta-eating across the country. Scroll down for video . Natural: Kathryn Beale\u00a0whizzes plcenta into smoothies or into pills for women convinced of its health benefits . Swindon Council is claiming that her services pose a danger to the mothers she is trying to help, and are taking her to court saying they want to stop her from trading. They have already taken half her essential kit, including a grinder and a pill-maker, meaning she can no longer provide her service. She said: \u2018It does seem like a witch-hunt. Why should they be doing everything they can to stop me providing a service which I believe helps new mothers? Yes, some people might be squeamish about it, but that doesn\u2019t give the council the right to just close me down.\u2019 IPEN director Lynnea Shrief lost her court battle against Dacorum Council in Hertfordshire last year. She believes the legal action is part of a national move to shut down the industry. Three other IPEN businesses have also faced opposition from local authorities. Benefits: Mothers say eating placenta has helped to increase their milk supply and reduce post-natal bleeding. Pictured: Placenta capsules . It was in March that the council took action against Kathryn. Health bosses claimed that dangerous microbes would multiply while the placenta was being processed in her kitchen \u2013 with the risk of poisoning the mother. Last month, Swindon failed to convince a magistrate to grant a hygiene emergency prohibition order against Kathryn, who contested the order. Despite noting her various food-safety certificates, and failing to advise how she might satisfy their health risk concerns, the council is trying again and she will re-appear in court in May. Kathryn says of the council\u2019s inspection: \u2018It was clear they didn\u2019t know how a maternity ward works. They had the impression that placentas were just falling out of women all over the floor and being put into buckets with other placentas. It\u2019s just not the case.\u2019 Kathryn provides her clients \u2013 mostly well-educated, professional women \u2013 with a large zip-lock bag into which the placenta is placed. The bagged organ is then put into a large leak-proof plastic box, which goes into a cool bag packed with ice packs ready for Kathryn to collect. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Mad Men star January Jones (left) and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton (right) If the mother has requested a \u00a320 placenta smoothie at the birth, Kathryn blends some with fruit and apple juice using a hand-held blender. She takes the remainder home and either steams the organ with lemon, ginger and green chilli, or dries slices of placenta in a dehydrator before grinding the pieces into a powder which she makes into capsules. This service costs \u00a3150. Kathryn, a former primary school teacher turned birth \u2018doula\u2019 \u2013 a non-medical supporter for expectant mothers \u2013 became interested in placenta consumption after watching chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall flambee one on TV. She added placenta processing to her birth doula business in March 2013 after a day-long IPEN training course. She obtained certificates in food safety for manufacturing, infection control, and HACCP, a food safety management system. A Swindon Council spokesman said: \u2018Preparation of foodstuffs using human placenta in this way can present a number of potentially serious health risks to those who consume them. We are legally obliged to investigate and take whatever steps are necessary to protect consumers.\u2019 A key genetic mutation could explain why some children who catch flu are left fighting for their lives in hospital \u2013 while others just need a day or two in bed. Scientists discovered the mutation after studying a two-year-old French girl who nearly died from the flu. They found she was particularly vulnerable because she had inherited a rare double genetic mutation from both of her parents which meant she was unable to produce a protein called interferon. Interferon, which is commercially available, helps the immune system attack flu and could now be used to save young victims. Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova, from the Imagine Institute of Genetic Diseases in Paris, and the St Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Disease at Rockefeller University in the US, said: \u2018This finding suggests that one could treat severe childhood flu with interferon.\u2019 The girl, who was critically ill with flu in 2011, has not had the virus since, after being vaccinated annually. The researchers\u2019 findings have been published in the journal Science.",

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled\u00a01,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits,\u00a0indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there\u2019s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia\u00a0there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you\u2019re allergic to dust mites you basically can\u2019t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings\u2019 or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body\u2019s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They\u2019re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a\u00a0humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It\u2019s because your dog\u2019s hair has allergens on it \u2013 left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too \u2013 forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.",

These vintage posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience, passengers wore their best clothes and there was plenty of legroom. They\u2019re featured in a new coffee table book, Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975, which revisits a time when the skies were dominated by the likes of Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) and Continental. Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda\u2019s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in\u00a0Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist . British Overseas Airways Corp led to the creation of British Airways (left) while Continental merged with United Airlines' parent company . It was a time when it cost an incredible amount of money to purchase a ticket for a commercial flight, with many of the ads promoting transatlantic or transpacific travel. The adverts created for the biggest airlines of the day, including many which no longer exist, offer a glimpse at how air travel, advertising and society changed over the 30-year period covered in the book. From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart . The book hails the designers' creative genius and uses special techniques to replicate their work as accurately as possible . In addition to drawings the adverts include photos of natural beauty spots, including Sydney Harbour (left) and Bermuda's beaches (right) Mr Huhne\u2019s book hails their creative genius and uses 17 colours, five types of varnishes and two methods of foil printing and embossing to replicate their work as accurately as possible. Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 was published by Berlin-based Callisto Publishers, which offered this synopsis of the tome: \u2018It provides unique insight into the design and advertising methods of an era when airlines were considered the most glamorous business sector and quality was the main criterion for selecting a flight.\u2019 It retails from approximately \u00a3270 online in the UK and from $250 online in the US.",

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr\u00a0Prasanna . \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,\u2019 he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: \u2018Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c . \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O\u2019Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll and\u00a0Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr\u00a0Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.",

But there is another form of the deadly gas, dubbed abiotic methane, that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor. Now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor . The reservoirs are secure, and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change. Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane, that can later be used as fuel. One reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge, in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'This ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the Arctic environment is ideal for this type of methane production,' said Joel Johnson associate professor at the University of New Hampshire. The Center for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Climate and Environment (Cage) estimates that up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of hydrates in the ocean floor. Scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\u00a0One such reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge (pictured), in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'But this estimate is not accounting for abiotic methane. So there is probably much more,' said Cage director J\u00fcrgen Mienert. Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. However, methane is also the principle component in natural gas.\u00a0It is a lucrative fuel source, which could contain more energy than all the world's oil, coal and gas put together. They believe the gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. 'Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor,' said Johnson. 'These only form in slow to ultraslow spreading seafloor crust. The optimal temperature range for serpentinisation of ocean crust is 200 \u2013 350 degrees Celsius.' Methane produced by serpentinisation can escape through cracks and faults, and end up at the ocean floor, causing a concern for future global warming. But in the Knipovich Ridge it is trapped as gas hydrate in the sediments. 'In other known settings the abiotic methane escapes into the ocean, where it potentially influences ocean chemistry,' says Johnson. 'But if the pressure is high enough, and the subsea floor temperature is cold enough, the gas gets trapped in a hydrate structure below the sea floor.' B\u00fcnz says that there are many places in the Arctic Ocean with a similar tectonic setting as the Knipovich ridge. Rather than causing a concern, the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long-term storage of methane carbon in deep-marine sediments. But other types of methane in the Arctic are causing a concern for scientists. Last year Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He tweeted: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane \u2013 which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Samples of the gas hydrates will provide more knowledge on abiotic methane. But they need to be drilled, as they are 140 metres under the ocean floor .",

These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about \"100 Days of Rejection\", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. \"I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,\" explained Jiang. The project started out to help \"fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,\" he said. \"The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection.\" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. \"My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle.\" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you: . 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

The Oxford crew were training on the Thames for the\u00a0Boat Race which \u00a0takes place on Saturday, April 11 . The RNLI revealed the conditions were caused by strong wind against the tide creating three successive waves that poured over the boat's riggers, 'creating an influx of water that could not be managed by the craft's bilge pump'. In a statement RNLI helmsman Ian Owen said: 'While we have rescued quite a number of rowers over the years, this is the first time I've been involved in helping such a prestigious team. 'The weather can be unpredictable on the Thames, and the Oxford University team dealt with the situation as safely and calmly as possible. We wish them all the best for their upcoming race.' Chiswick and Tower stations are the busiest in the country, and the RNLI has saved over 3,600 people since the service began in 2002.

Brian Karl Brimager, 37, entered his plea on Friday after he was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego, in connection with the death of Yvonne Lee Baldelli. He has been in custody since June 2013 on charges including obstruction of justice and falsifying records related to the investigation. The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Niguel, California, was last seen in September 2011 when she arrived in Panama with Brimager. Her family reported her missing the following January. Brian Karl Brimager, 37, was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego, in connection with the death of Yvonne Lee Baldelli . The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Niguel, California, was last seen in September 2011 when she arrived in Panama with Brimager. Her family reported her missing the following January . The indictment alleges that Brimager murdered Baldelli, dismembered her body and disposed of her body parts in a remote jungle area. Brimager then engaged in an elaborate scheme to cover up the crime, including destroying evidence and sending a series of emails purportedly from Baldelli in order to make it appear to her friends and family that she was still alive, according to court papers. The indictment also alleges that Brimager attempted to conceal his crime by disposing of a bloody mattress involved in Badelli's murder in the ocean. Brimager conducted two Internet searches on Baldelli's computer, one for 'washing mattress' and a second for 'washing mattress blood stain,' according to documents. A man who was cutting bushes on the island province of Bocas del Toro found a bag containing Baldelli's remains in August 2013. Baldelli's family has the clothing designer was frequently out of touch so they did not immediately suspect anything was wrong. Panama police say Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States about 10 days after last being seen with Baldelli. In 2012\u00a0FBI agents and Panamanian forensic specialists found traces of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, which is the popular tourist spot where Baldelli was last seen.

But a survey of workers has also revealed working for government departments - long considered an easy ride - are among the jobs people would most like to have. The Department of Immigration ranked third in the survey, while the\u00a0Department of Defence and the Department of Health were also named in the top ten places Australians would like to work. Virgin, the second-largest airline in the country, was reportedly handed the accolade for its \u2018pleasant working atmosphere, a good work-life balance and strong management\u2019. Richard Branson's Virgin Airline is the place most Australians want to work for, according to a new survey . Desk jobs in government departments highly ranked in Australia\u2019s Most Attractive Employer awards . More than 50 per cent of participants in a study of 12,000 appeared to want to work for boss Richard Branson. Coming second in the survey of Australia\u2019s Most Attractive Employer is national public broadcaster the ABC \u2013 confirming a TV career is still high on the list of many people\u2019s dream jobs. And named in third place Thursday was the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, headed up by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Other Australians named the ABC as the place they would most like to work, alongside journalist Leigh Sales . Fourth and fifth place at the Randstad Awards were also airline and TV jobs, with the Seven Network and Qantas named respectively. People were asked which companies they had heard of, just how much they would like to work there and why they would like to work there. Frank Ribuot, CEO of Randstad Australia, said: \u2018The Virgin brand is widely recognised around the world and by people from all walks of life. The Department of Health came in at number 10 in the survey of where most Australians want to work . The Department of Immigration, headed up by Peter Dutton (right), came third. While other Aussies want to work Samantha Armytage at the Seven Network (left) \u2018For the past few years, Virgin Australia has been recognised as one of the best employers in Australia so it\u2019s testament to the company\u2019s continued investment towards building its employer brand that this year it has taken the highest accolade.\u2019 Geraldine Chin Moody, Group Executive, People, Culture and Sustainability Virgin Australia, said: \u2018Our people have been key to the successful transformation of the airline over the past few years, and this award is testament to their outstanding professionalism and dedication to excellence. \u2018Our focus is on supporting our team to actively manage their careers and develop to their full potential. Our people get opportunities to be involved in our transformational projects and build their skills internally.\u2019 Qantas was beaten by Virgin Australia as the top place to work but it still came in fifth place in the survey . In sixth place was multinational food and beverage company Nestle who have headoffice in Rhodes in NSW . In seventh place, Aussies would like a job at Coles or Kmart owners Wesfarmers .

Trott, who looks sure to open with Alastair Cook in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday, fell for just two, top-edging an attempted pull against a St Kitts side bolstered by England bowlers Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood. It follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his England team-mate Jimmy Anderson but Trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in St Kitts ahead of the main business next week. Jonathan Trott failed twice with the bat during England's warm-up for the first Test in Basseterre . Trott is dismissed by his England team-mate James Anderson in St Kitts . Trott\u2019s only rival for the opener slot, Yorkshire\u2019s Adam Lyth, was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but Alastair Cook and Ian Bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match. England gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first Test as their low-key warm-up week meandered to a close. Their four days of cricket  have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action. Trott looks set to open the batting with Alastair Cook in Antigua in the first Test next week . England completed four days of low-key, uncompetitive warm-up action in Basseterre on Thursday . Alastair Cook . Jonathan Trott . Gary Ballance . Ian Bell . Joe Root . Ben Stokes . Jos Buttler . Chris Jordan . Stuart Broad . James Tredwell . Jimmy Anderson . The decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow Chris Jordan and James Tredwell to face some admittedly low-quality bowling, suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team. Barring a raging turner in Antigua next week there will be only one spinning place and Tredwell, already a likelier pick than Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit. His dismissal gave Rashid a chance of his own but Tredwell was given priority and can now start preparing for a second Test cap. Jordan, meanwhile, was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session, when England pressed for an extra half-hour's play following rain delays. That suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett, who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case. Captain Cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on Thursday . Ian Bell looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired . England will leave St Kitts and head to Antigua for the first Test against the West Indies on Monday . Those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill, with Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side, while Gary Ballance, Trott and Root featured for both teams at various points. Bell looked in best form, making a fluent 43 before retiring, while captain Cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session.",

The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck \u2013 but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property \u2013 leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour\u2019s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over \u00a32million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a \u00a320million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for \u00a36.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for \u00a34.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents\u2019 in the hope of securing it for his family \u2013 his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: \u2018There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.\u2019 Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election. Eye for detail: The living room inside Campbell's \u00a36.75million Chelsea flat boasts lavish furnishings . Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a \u2018cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well\u2019. He told The Times: \u2018With a mansion tax, you\u2019re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I\u2019d leave. I\u2019d have to say, \u201cSorry, I want to ship out\u201d.\u2019 Campbell has also said: \u2018I\u2019m not earning what I was earning five years ago.\u2019 Experts have said that properties worth between \u00a35million and \u00a310million could incur an annual charge of up to \u00a325,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: \u2018Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.\u2019 Since 2009 Campbell has also owned Grade II-listed Hallington Hall, an 18th Century mansion in Northumberland. Fortune: Campbell accumulated a number of properties before and after his football career but has since said 'I don't earn what I used to' Campbell recently featured in a hard-hitting campaign to encourage ethnic minority Britons to vote .",

The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant . Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs .

'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness . 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her. 'She's like the old Lizzi I used to know as a little girl.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe title race appears to be over, but what about the fight to stay in the Premier League? No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It\u2019s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season . Seven points split Sunderland in 15th and Leicester in 20th as the battle for Premier League survival heats up . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Crystal Palace (H) -D . Stoke (A) - D . Southampton (H) - L . Everton (A) - L . Leicester (H) - W . Arsenal (A) - L . Chelsea (A) L . Predicted total: 34 points . Verdict: Safe . Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for. They need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it\u2019s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Aston Villa . Position: 16th on 29 points . Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . Tim Sherwood has helped Villa rediscover their scoring touch since replacing Paul Lambert as manager . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester City (A) - L . Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points . Steve Bruce's Hull  are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining . Ahmed Elmohamady will be a key man in Hull's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Southampton (A) - L . Liverpool (H) - D . Crystal Palace (A) - D . Arsenal (H) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester United (H) - L . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Safe. On goal difference. The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR\u2019s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in . Chris Ramsey may find QPR's goal difference a big disadvantage, particularly with a tough final seven games . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Chelsea (H) - L . West Ham (H) - W . Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City \u2013 games you would expect them to lose anywhere \u2013 are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull\u2019s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points . Danny Ings will spearhead Burnley's attack as they attempt to escape the Premier League relegation zone . Sean Dyche's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against Hull and Villa . Predicted results: Six points from seven games . Arsenal (H) \u2013 L . Everton (A) - D . Leicester (H) \u2013 W . West Ham (A) - D . Hull (A) - L . Stoke (H) - D . Aston Villa (A) - L . Predicted total: 32 points . Verdict: Relegated . On paper they probably have the most straightforward opponents, but have the misfortune of playing two of their most critical fixtures \u2013 against Hull and Villa \u2013 away from Turf Moor. They have won only once away all season so it would be extremely ambitious to expect them to make hay now, considering four of those seven fixtures are on the road. Would expect their status to be decided by the final two games. Leicester . Position: 20th on 22 points . Esteban Cambiasso celebrates after an impressive display helped Leicester beat West Ham 2-1 on Saturday . Nigel Pearson (left) has eight games remaining to get Leicester safe and has five home games to play . Predicted results: Four points from eight games . West Brom (A) - L . Swansea (H) - D . Burnley (A) - L . Chelsea (H) - L . Newcastle (H) - D . Southampton (H) - D . Sunderland (A) - L . QPR (H) - D . Predicted total: 26 points . Verdict: Relegated . As with Burnley, it\u2019s not the most intimidating run-in and they do have the most games from which to gain points. They also have the slight advantage of five fixtures at home. But 22 points from 30 games so far offers little indication that they will mount any kind of sprint for the line.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA father who is feared to have fled to Syria with his partner and four young children was a member of a banned extremist group, it was reported last night. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, their daughter Zoha, seven, and their three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one, were all caught on camera on a cross-Channel ferry. They left their home in Slough, Berkshire, without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which is out of character, police said. Scroll down for video . Detectives have released CCTV footage of   Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children, who have been reported missing from Britain, at a busy ferry port as they apparently head to Syria . Police say Mr Malik (pictured with one of his young children) had told his family he wanted to 'go and live in a Muslim country' and the family left without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to relatives, it is claimed . Members of Mr Malik's family tonight said they had been left 'completely devastated' and issued a desperate plea for the six to return home. In a statement, they said: 'We are totally distraught, upset and in shock' Police have warned that the Muslim family, who were last seen in Slough, Berkshire on April 7, may be heading to Syria. They are pictured at Dover port before catching a ferry to Calais, France on April 8 . The family, from Slough in Berkshire, are believed to have boarded the Dover to Calais ferry just after midnight on April 8 before travelling south through Europe including to Budapest in Hungary on April 12 . Protest: Malik, seen holding the 'hands off Muslims!' sign, outside Regents Park Mosque last year - next to him is Abu Rumaysah who jumped bail to flee to Syria . But radical preacher Anjem Choudary said yesterday Malik was a member of the banned group Al-Muhajiroun and a 'champion for sharia' who regularly attended the group's demonstrations. Neighbours said the family were known to police and had been questioned on suspicion of terrorist involvement four years ago. Uniformed police waited for the family for three days before talking to them, they said. There will now be questions for police after they failed to stop a suspected extremist from slipping out of the country with his family. Choudary said Malik remained 'very influential in the community' after Al-Muhajiroun was banned five years ago. 'Back in the day he was a member until the group was banned. He was still part of our demonstrations and lectures but I hadn't seen him for a few months,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'Asif is a very good friend of mine. I haven't seen him for a while but from what I gather in the reports he and his family have left the country.' He added: 'He is a very studious man, a very good Muslim character. He was always a champion for sharia and is very influential in the community.' Choudary also criticised the Government for trying to restrict British Muslims from travelling to Syria. 'I think they want to live under sharia and escape the oppressive life they have in this country and under this government,' he added. Asif Malik (left), 31, and his partner Sara Kiran (right), 29, were reported missing from Slough, Berkshire, after their childrenl failed to show up to school and their grandmother became worried about their whereabouts . Zoha Malik (left), seven, and Essa Malik (right), four, are among the family's four children who are missing . The family were last seen on Tuesday, April 7, and were captured on CCTV boarding a ferry from Dover to Calais on Wednesday, April 8. They are believed to have travelled south through Europe by train and were seen in Budapest on Sunday, April 12, before making their way to Turkey. Relatives reported them missing to police on Thursday and officers are concerned they may be seeking to travel to Syria. Last night, Malik's family said they were 'completely devastated' by the family's sudden decision to leave Britain. 'All we wish for is your safe return and especially the return of the children. We are not angry with you, we are just heartbroken,' they said in an appeal to him. Zakariya Malik (left), two, and\u00a0Yhaya Malik (right), one, were last seen with their family in Berkshire on April 7 . Mr Malik and Miss Kiran's last known address in Slough was in this block of flats (pictured on the left, above) Neighbours said today that police had broken down the door on Thursday night to enter the family's home . Thames Valley Police's Acting Deputy Chief Constable, John Campbell, said it was a 'real concern' they had reached Syria. 'I'm not suggesting for one moment that they are intending to join Islamic State,' he said. 'At the same time we know that [relatives] have voiced some concerns about the family's intentions. There's been a suggestion that [Malik] in the past has said that he would like to live in a Muslim state.' Acting deputy chief constable John Campbell (pictured at a press conference in Kidlington today) said Thames Valley Police is 'extremely concerned for the safety of this family, especially the four young children' The alarm was raised when some of the children failed to attend Claycots Primary School in Slough . Yesterday, the family's next-door neighbour said they had been in trouble with the police four years ago. He added: 'People were saying that they were extremists and that police were listening in on their phone calls. I think they were under surveillance. 'The police sat in the stairwell for three days waiting for them. 'It's such a shame. Those kids are now in danger because of what their parents believe in.'",

He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: \"Stop this Tim, don't do it\".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. Above, a picture of the street where the assault happened . 'I hope you are thoroughly ashamed of yourself.' Nick Tucker, defending, said: 'It's clear from her statement that [the victim] loves her son and she's concerned for him, despite what she's suffered. 'One of the reasons this is not only sad, but a difficult case, is that we can't confidently say why this happened. 'The defendant is unable to explain what triggered this or the previous assaults.' Norris-Jones was handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, at Guildford Crown Court (above) and will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet enforcing a strict 12-month curfew . Norris-Jones, from Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, admitted two counts of ABH and was cleared of one count of GBH when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court. He was handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet enforcing a strict 12-month curfew. He was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 costs.",

And now that status update about jetting off on holiday is set to be even easier after Virgin Atlantic announced it would allow each passenger one Facebook login for free so they can post an update from 35,000ft. The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",

Visitors at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo in Ohio heard a scream as the toddler tumbled into the pit at 3pm on Saturday. His parents jumped in and pulled him to safety before paramedics arrived to treat the boy for a leg injury. Though the felines appeared to avoid the child, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said there is a strong chance charges will be pressed on Monday. Scroll down for video . A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He told CNN: 'Unfortunately, we have a number of eyewitness accounts that point to the strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the rail.' According to witnesses the mother was holding him and another child when he fell. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream.

A policeman convicted of misconduct in a public office after having sex with women he met on duty was today labelled \u2018a disgrace\u2019 to the force. Adam Rushton took advantage of being a beat officer in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, to have sex with women, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The 37-year-old officer was found guilty of five counts of misconduct and another of breaching data protection rules by obtaining personal data. Rushton, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, denied ten counts of misconduct and two of breaching data protection laws while employed by police. He was acquitted on the remaining counts. Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 who had \u2018brought shame on himself, his colleagues\u2019 and the force. Giving evidence, Rushton, who has been with the force for ten years, conceded some of his actions were \u2018not very professional\u2019 but claimed it did not amount to criminal misbehaviour. During the trial, he said he never expected to end up in the dock after going to one woman's home and having oral sex. \u2018It's not very professional, I fully accept that, and that it's wrong,\u2019 Rushton told jurors. \u2018But no way whatsoever did I think I'd be standing here.\u2019 He was convicted over that offence, and of making a social visit to another victim, while on the clock. Rushton was also convicted of having sex with a different woman at her house. He was found guilty on two counts relating to another woman, whom he met outside work, on one occasion having sex with her while on another exchanging \u2018playful and flirty\u2019 text messages before going to her home. Beat officer: Rushton has been with Staffordshire Police (whose headquarters are pictured) for ten years . His conviction for breaching data rules was in relation to looking up information relating to a fifth victim. The offences all happened between 2008 and 2012. When first interviewed over the allegations in April 2013, he denied sleeping with all but one of the women, however later accepted he had sex with several others. However, he denied his actions were criminal misconduct. Rushton had an impressive professional record as a neighbourhood policing officer, with many letters of praise from senior officers. But Crown Prosecutor Duncan Bould said the constable's duties brought him into contact with \u2018vulnerable and frightened females, often in extreme circumstances\u2019 and he had \u2018sought to take advantage of those situations to have sexual activity of some kind with them\u2019. Criticism:\u00a0Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker (pictured) called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 after the verdicts . None of the women made any complaints to police about Rushton. He was conditionally bailed after the verdicts were read out and will be sentenced at the crown court on May 1. After the hearing, Mr Baker apologised to the police officer's victims on behalf of the force. He said: \u2018This was an astonishing breach of trust by an individual officer and he has badly let down vulnerable victims and their families. The public must be able to trust their police officers, and on this occasion they have been let down. \u2018We made the decision that Rushton should be prosecuted as a police officer, and hope this sends out a very strong message - no matter who you are, and what position you hold, if you commit crime you will be dealt with firmly and robustly.\u2019 He added that after the allegations came to light in 2013, the matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which carried out an investigation. Mr Baker said that, as a result, \u2018robust processes\u2019 were now in place to prevent such incidents happening. IPCC commissioner Kathryn Stone said Rushton had abused a position of trust and used his job \u2018in a calculated manner to satisfy his own sexual desires\u2019. Ms Stone added: \u2018The IPCC has previously expressed concern at the number of cases across England and Wales where officers have targeted vulnerable women for sex. 'And I hope that today's outcome reinforces a message that corrupt officers will be discovered and brought before the courts where appropriate.\u2019",

A dramatic rescue earlier in the week led to 210 mainly-Burmese nationals being identified, the vast majority of whom said they were desperate to leave the island village of Benjina. Those who said they wanted to stay did so because they\u00a0claimed they were owed years of back pay from their bosses. An in-depth investigation by The Associated Press published last month led to the discovery of massive rights abuses in Benjina and surrounding waters. The report traced slave-caught seafood from there to Thailand where it can then enter the supply chains of some of U.S. retailers. Slaves: A dramatic rescue earlier in the week led to many of the mainly-Burmese nationals being identified, the vast majority of whom said they were desperate to leave the the island village of Benjina . Rescued: Last week, Indonesian authorities rescued around 330 migrants from Benjina, bringing them to the island of Tual, where they are now being sheltered by the government . Many of the men interviewed said they were tricked or even kidnapped before being put on boats in Thailand and taken to Indonesia. They were forced to work almost non-stop under horrendous conditions, some brutally beaten by their Thai captains when they were sick or caught resting. Last week, Indonesian authorities rescued around 330 migrants from Benjina, bringing them to the island of Tual, where they are now being sheltered by the government. Those found Thursday by a team, which included Myanmar officials, remain in Benjina. While most fisherman found in Benjina were Burmese, there also were scores of Cambodians. The toll of 550 did not include men - many of whom also were enslaved - from poor parts of Thailand. Shocking: Many of the men interviewed said they were tricked or even kidnapped before being put on boats in Thailand and taken to Indonesia . Export: The report traced slave-caught seafood from there to Thailand where it can then enter the supply chains of some of American retailers . It's unclear who will pay for the mass repatriation. A former slave now in Tual said conditions were relatively good there. He said the men are getting medical care and enough to eat, but their living quarters are cramped and many do not have a change of clothes since they left quickly with only what they were wearing. Meanwhile, Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday told reporters in her country's capital, Naypyitaw, it was up to governments 'to protect the rights of the citizens and to bring them back out of bondage.'

The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe. 'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said. China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build . 'It's a very difficult system to make operational.' A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher. Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University. The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write.

Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I\u2019ve ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette \u2013 silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys \u2013 it\u2019s what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour',\u00a0come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don\u2019t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot\u2019s Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room \u2013 say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to\u00a0communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you\u2019ll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You\u2019ll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo \u2013 all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery \u2013 you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don\u2019t neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you\u2019ve made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

The Channel 4 programme, hosted by actor Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead, celebrates the duo's love affair with classic cars. And each episode looks at the history of various types of vehicles, as the pair give old-bangers a new lease of life by restoring them to their former glory. Actor Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead return to present a new series of For The Love of Cars . A teaser from the first episode shows Glenister \u2013 perhaps most recognisable behind the wheel of a red Audi Quattro while playing Gene Hunt in Ashes to Ashes \u2013 test driving an Aston Martin Vantage. Revving the engine before taking off at speed around a winding country road, Glenister appears to wipe the colour from Anstead's face before stating: 'This is Bond.' The second series also sees the pair broaden their horizon by working on a number of foreign-manufactured cars as opposed to just primarily British ones. Additionally, they work on more than one vehicle per episode and complete stalled restoration projects, instead of just finding dilapidated cars to fix. The finished products are then auctioned off at the end of every programme, and Anstead admits that the quality of the restorations make it hard for the owners to let go. He said: \u2018You have to remember, these cars have a special place in the hearts of these people, for various different reasons. Glenister and Anstead speed around a bend as they test drive a classic Aston Martin Vantage . \u2018For somebody to let go of something that important to them is hard enough, but when they see the results at the end of the restoration, it\u2019s really tough. \u2018These are jobs that they\u2019ve not been able to finish themselves.\u2019 The cars featured in the series include a quintessentially British Aston Martin DBS, which was brought back to life after been recovered from a barn in Oxfordshire. For The Love of Cars series two is branching out beyond just British vehicle makeovers . And a Rover SD1 police car \u2013 the classic panda car of the early 1980s \u2013 which features in a  race conducted by the show\u2019s presenters, to find out what side of the law had a speed advantage. The pair also restore two of the most iconic cars to ever come out of Europe \u2013 a run-down Fiat 500 and a VW Beetle. The first episode of For the Love of Cars will broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday, April 19 at 8pm.",

Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck . Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot . 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire's\u00a0Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door. Ingenuity: The couple started with a steel frame and slowly, project by project, built a home in about a year and a half . Gorgeous: Hannah and Alex now have a gorgeous, wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook . Details: The couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold, stained glass windows and other creature comforts . They're nearly self-sufficient, too. The home is powered mostly by solar panels. Alex said their first power bill was just $25. The stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring. 'I didn't want to live inside a plastic box,' Alex said. 'Not because I'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be.' All told, the project cost Hannah and Alex about $25,000. And the couple even plans to build another one like one day. 'It's really, really nice,' Hannah said. 'We love it.'

Thrifty motorists whose budgets won't stretch to the favourite luxury car of the Labour peer might consider 'two dragons' instead. For Korea's SsangYong is launching a new sports utility vehicle from under \u00a313,000 that promises value for money motoring for drivers who believe in watching their pennies. But SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') has given its new sporty five-door family runaround a very European name - Tivoli - after the stylish Italian town near Rome, home to the Villa d'Este, a Unesco world heritage site famed for its Renaissance architecture and garden. SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') is launching a value for money sports utility vehicle . Pitched to take on the pumpedup Nissan Juke, the Tivoli SUV is powered by 1.6 litre Euro 6 petrol and diesel engines with six speed manual and automatic transmissions. It arrives in the UK this summer in three trim levels - SE, EX, ELX - with a choice of front-wheel drive or 'intelligent' 4x4 and seven airbags across the range. There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty. The entry level SE, from \u00a312,950, is finished in grey cloth trim and includes 16-in alloys, cruise control, a petrol stop/go system, seven airbags and 'smart' steering with normal, comfort and sport modes. The top-of-the-range ELX, from \u00a316,000 to \u00a319,000, comes fully loaded with a choice of the full range of engines and gearboxes plus diamond cut alloy wheels, smart keyless starting, front and rear parking sensors, privacy glass, rear spoiler, automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, TomTom navigation system with 7 in touch screen and a rear-view camera. There is a choice of six exterior colours, and even a 'My Tivoli' personalisation programme which allows customers to create their own distinctive car. This includes the styling pack (\u00a3400) which gives a choice of five two-tone roof combinations, plus further engine and drivetrain options. As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy connectivity to their IT devices. SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year. UK chief executive Paul Williams says: 'This is a car that will really put SsangYong on the map and change perceptions.' Citroen's Aircross model (above) has protective alloy bumps front and side . Motorists of a certain age may recall those fondly remembered TV adverts from childhood for rufty-tufty Tonka Toys. These were virtually indestructible metal cars - usually 4x4s or trucks with massive wheels. The TV advert informed viewers: 'They build real tough toys, for real tough boys - Tonka!' Well, Citroen seems to have taken its inspiration from them for its Aircross model (above). It even has protective alloy bumps front and side made from honeycomb aluminium castings surrounded by hard rubber. Billed as a big brother to the current Citroen C4 Cactus, it was shown in prototype hybrid form at the Shanghai Motor Show in China. Citroen's global boss, Briton Linda Jackson, says her company has to regain the sort of design flair that created the 2CV: 'If we want stand-out cars, then we have to be bold.' The prototype has a 1.6 litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor combining to create 313bhp. Citroen claims a special boost function will help it accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.5 seconds. Don't hold your breath. But many do see it as France's answer to Britain's new Land Rover Discovery Sport. Ii is almost time for the next Goodwood Festival of Speed. Tickets have now gone on sale for the event which runs from June 25 to 28. The theme of 'Flat-Out and Fearless: Racing on the Edge' pays tribute to the drivers and constructors throughout history who 'threw caution to the wind in pursuit of victory'. Goodwood favourites: JackieStewart and his wife Helen . The festival, billed as 'the world's largest automotive garden party' is held in the grounds of Lord March's Goodwood House and estate near Chichester, West Sussex. It attracts the A-list of the world motor manufacturing chiefs, motor sport legends - from Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart - as well as showbiz celebrities in a way the original British Motor Show never could. More than 600 cars and motorcycles spanning the phenomenal history of motoring and motor sport take part alongside a 'Moving Motor Show' presented by the AA. The traditional central feature - a vast automotive-themed sculpture - will this year honour Japanese car giant Mazda's contribution to motoring and motor sport in the year that the latest incarnation of its best-selling MX-5 sports car is launched. Details and tickets: goodwood.com. Race and road car designer Professor Gordon Murray - who produced the legendary McLaren F1 supercar - is to collaborate with engine specialist Osamu Goto to create an ultracompact fuel-efficient vehicle for city use. But it has to run on conventional fuels such as petrol. The car, being sponsored by Shell under the code-name 'Project M' is to be unveiled in November.",

Adele Berry, of Reddish, Greater Manchester, spoke to the call handler when she contacted the mobile phone company over a problem with her bill. But she was left shocked when the man later got in touch with her,  calling himself her 'future hubby' and asking about his 'in laws'. Scroll down for video . Adele Berry has told of her shock after she was bombarded with texts from a Vodafone call centre worker . Ms Berry was put through to a call centre in South Africa when she phoned the company over the issue last month. She says she made small talk with the man who answered the query to fill 'dead air', but did nothing to suggest she was interested in him. The 21-year-old was stunned when she later received a string of messages from the man, who said his name is 'Miguel'. In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons . The man has sent her 18 messages since she made the call, some of which have referred to his family in Liverpool, making Ms Berry fear he may try to approach her. She told the\u00a0Manchester Evening News: 'It is quite scary, it is quite distressing. He won't leave me alone. Being pestered by someone I don't know gets me quite nervous.' The man has now been suspended by Vodafone, which says it has a number of call centres in the UK but also sends some callers through to their office in South Africa. A spokesman said: 'We take allegations of this kind extremely seriously. We have spoken to Ms Berry and the adviser concerned has been suspended pending a full investigation.'",

Casey Veal's son Zayden was just 10 months old when he was bludgeoned to death by a drug-crazed burglar who broke into their Bendigo home at random, whilst the baby slept in his cot in June 2012. 'It tortures because it's something that's always like \u2013 why me? Why our house? Why our Zayden?' a heartbroken Ms Veal told 60 Minutes. The culprit was 19-year-old Harley Hicks who bashed baby Zayden more than 30 times with a homemade baton during a senseless and unprovoked robbery, fuelled by ice and marijuana. Casey Veal's son Zayden was just 10 months old when he was bludgeoned to death by a drug-crazed burglar who broke into their Bendigo home at random in the middle of the night as the family slept . The culprit was 19-year-old Harley Hicks (pictured) who bashed baby Zayden more than 30 times with a homemade baton during a senseless and unprovoked robbery, fuelled by ice and marijuana . Heartbroken mother Casey Veal (pictured) has spoken out about her relentless grief after her baby son was brutally murdered in a random attack when a stranger broke into their home . 'My son was murdered so he could get a hit of ice. That's it,' Ms Veal told 60 Minutes. Hicks left the home with nothing more than a wallet and a pair of sunglasses. He unplugged the baby monitor before unleashing the vicious attack on the defenceless baby while Ms Veal and Zayden's brother Xavier, then aged three, slept. When Ms Veal woke she realised they'd been robbed. She was then faced with the horror of discovering the brutal attack on her son, leaving him almost beyond recognition. 'When I walked over to the cot, I pulled the blankets back and that's when I saw his face and there was blood everywhere underneath him,' she said tearfully. Zayden had been repeatedly bashed before he was stabbed 32 times with a homemade copper baton. The happy baby with a beautiful smile suffered a crushed skull, broken collar bone and a broken rib. He was rushed to hospital but couldn't be saved.

The happy baby with a beautiful smile suffered a crushed skull, broken collar bone and a broken rib . The baby was a victim of a random attack yet his mother remains wracked with guilt. 'He was gone so I asked if I could have him, I just wanted to hold him,' she told 60 Minutes. 'I just sat and I cried. I just said 'I am so sorry.' 'I'm so sorry that I failed. My only job as your mum was to look after you and I didn't.' The new interview coincides with the federal government's announcement of the introduction of a task force to combat the 'national ice epidemic'. Assistant Health Minister Fiona Nash says the best way to reduce demand for ice is to educate the community, not just police its use. 'We can't arrest our way out of this problem,' she told ABC TV. The health and education campaign will warn Australians about the dangers of the drug. Its key message would be that a momentary high would lead to a lifetime of pain and suffering, Mr Abbott said. He declared the drug worse than heroin, LSD, cocaine or ecstasy. Justice Kaye said the murderer Hicks had at no point shown remorse.'Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby... or for his family' The baby was a victim of a random attack yet his mother Casey Veal (pictured) remains wracked with guilt . 'It's much more addictive, much more dangerous, much more damaging,' he told reporters in Sydney. Asked if the campaign would be as confronting as the infamous Grim Reaper AIDs ads of the 1980s, Senator . Nash said: 'We're going to do what's most effective.' The campaign will get underway 'well before' June 30, Mr Abbott later added. Ice is known for its intense comedowns and can make a person feel paranoid, hallucinate, aggressive and extremely violent. As for his motivation, Hicks has offered no explanation for why he committed the horrific act. The murder weapon, a homemade baton, was later discovered at Hick's home with his DNA on one end and Zayden's on the other.

Casey Veal says her now five-year-old son Xavier (left) remains deeply affected by the death of his baby brother Zayden (right) Yet after his arrest, Hicks tried to blame the murder on another person and reportedly lied throughout investigations. Harley Hicks has been sentenced to life in prison with 32 years non parole for the brutal murder of baby Zayden Veal-Whitting. 'It is almost unthinkable that any human being could have carried out such a sickening crime that you have committed,' Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye said in sentencing Hicks. 'What you did was totally and utterly evil.' Justice Kaye said he could not say for sure if Hicks had viciously snuffed out Zayden's cry in a bid to silence the baby during the robbery. 'If that constituted your motive for killing Zayden, then you murdered an innocent child so that you could escape the premises with the valuable items that you had stolen from it,' he said. 'On the other hand, if that was not your motive, then your murder of Zayden was simply an act of unmitigated evil committed by you for the sheer sake of it.'

Zayden had been repeatedly bashed before he was stabbed 32 times with a homemade copper baton . Zayden's mother Casey Veal arriving at the Supreme Court in Bendigo to see her son's killer sentenced . Justice Kaye said Hicks perpetrated an extraordinarily violent bashing on Zayden involving multiple blows with the baton to the head, face and other parts of his body. 'He was utterly harmless, defenceless and helpless,' he said. 'Any human being with even a shred of decency and humanity could only feel compassion, tenderness and protectiveness towards an infant in those circumstances. 'By contrast, you inflicted a brutal bashing, with a lethal instrument, on that baby. 'You crushed his skull, you savagely beat him with at least 30 blows.

Justice Kaye said Hicks perpetrated an extraordinarily violent bashing on Zayden involving multiple blows with the baton to the head, face and other parts of his body . The judge also described the English language as being 'entirely inadequate' to describe the horror and grief Zayden's mother, Casey Veal, and her family went through . Justice Kaye said Hicks, of North Bendigo, had shown no remorse. 'At no stage of the trial could I detect from you any sign of remorse. Nor was there even the slightest indication by you of any pity or sympathy for the baby, whose life you had taken, or for his family, whose lives you have shattered. 'Rather, you seemed totally oblivious and impervious to such human feelings.' The judge also described the English language as being 'entirely inadequate' to describe the horror and grief Zayden's mother, Casey Veal, and her family went through. In court before the sentencing in 2014, Ms Veal delivered a powerful impact statement, detailing the devastating impact of Zayden's murder on herself and her family's life forever. 'Since the crime occurred I have lost my outlook and determination in life I once had. I may stand before you alive and breathing but I'm but a shadow of my former self.' 'I am serving a life sentence... all I have is memories and most of them are tainted by this crime,' the statement read.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nAccused: Patrick Fredricksen, 30, in a police photo . A known child sex offender has been arrested on suspicion of stealing a school bus and driving it around to pick up youngsters. Patrick James Fredricksen, 30 - who has previous convictions for unlawful sexual activity with a minor and impersonating a firefighter - was stopped on his way to one child's home in eastern Utah, police say. He had already used the bus's on-board list of children's names and addresses to try and abduct a young girl, they added. Fredricksen has now been booked into Emery County Jail for investigation of theft of a vehicle and attempted child kidnapping. He is also expected to face a charge of damaging a prison after breaking a sprinkler pipe inside his cell and flooding the booking area, said sheriff spokeswoman Janalee Luke. Fredricksen's crime spree is alleged to have started while he was laying turf for a landscaping firm at a baseball complex in Huntington on Monday. An employee at the site phoned the local sheriff's office to report a worker 'was acting strange' and had left on foot with a set of master keys to the complex. Shortly afterwards, a nearby funeral-parlor worker reported that his car had been stolen from the company car park. Audacious: Fredricksen is said to have taken an American school bus and driven it to youngsters' homes . He told police he had noticed a 'suspicious' person around the building' but was talking to a bereaved family at the time so 'wasn't too concerned', according to the sheriff's office. They claim Fredricksen was the thief and that he drove the car to an empty school bus, which had its keys inside. 'After stealing the bus and using a list he found in the bus containing names and directions [to children's houses], Fredricksen attempted to pick one child up at her home and was asking directions to a second child's home,' said the sheriff's office. He had been foiled in his first attempt to a child after parking the bus on the family's driveway, according to KSL News.\u00a0The girl's father got to the vehicle first and would not let her board after quizzing the driver. Fredricksen was eventually stopped by a sheriff's lieutenant following a report of a suspicious person driving a school bus in the Cleveland area of Emery County.\u00a0The lieutenant said he halted the slow-moving vehicle by pulling in front of it. The empty school bus, thought to be identical to the ones seen here in Utah, reportedly had its keys inside . Fredricksen, who has also used the names Pat Shelton and Patrick Fredrickson, is on Utah's Sex Offender Registry after pleading guilty in 2004 to unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Court records show he was separately charged in 2005 with sexual exploitation of a minor and dealing in material harmful to a minor but the case was dismissed as part of an apparent plea bargain that resolved another case against him. The following year, Fredricksen was living in Salt Lake County when he pleaded guilty to impersonating a fireman. He had previously worked as a volunteer firefighter for the Huntington Fire Department but was dismissed in 2003 for stealing clothing and equipment. After his dismissal, he pinned on a stolen badge and lent a hand at emergencies, the court was told. He discovered where the real firefighters were working by listening to a police scanner. He also stole firefighting equipment and used his fake status to rent an apartment and get credit, according to newspaper reports from the time. He was sentenced to 36 months of probation and ordered to have counselling.",

Ride Like The Wind was one of 34 colts which remain in the first Classic of the season run on Saturday, May 2. Ride Like The Wind won just one of his four starts last season but he has run twice this term, posting a career best on his most recent start when landing the Group Three Prix Djebel by a head. French trainer Freddy Head likens his 2,000 Guineas hope Ride Like The Wind to Charm Spirit . Both the runner-up that day, Make Believe, and the fifth home, Sinfonietta, could reoppose in the Guineas to make it a three-pronged French assault on the 2,000 Guineas. Head said: \u2018Ride Like The Wind will run in the 2,000 Guineas. He has done very well since his last race, his work has been good, and I think that he has improved a bit. \u2018He is on the same sort of level as Charm Spirit was at this time last year. They are similar horses in that they tend to be a bit keen and if Ride Like The Wind settles better than Charm Spirit did last year I think that he has a good chance. Head says Ride Like The Wind is 'on the same sort of level' as Charm Spirit was at this time last year . \u2018That is why I have given him two runs already this season, to get the freshness out of him before the Guineas. 'I was very happy with his Prix Djebel victory. He settled then quickened well and it was to his credit that he won despite being held up at the back of the field when the pace was slow. 'The undulations at Newmarket won\u2019t be a problem for him and although seven furlongs is a good trip for him at the moment I think that he will stay a mile as long as he relaxes.\u2019 The Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained pair of Gleneagles and Highland Reel head the 2,000 Guineas entries. Also still in contention are the three winners of last week\u2019s Classic trials \u2013 Kool Kompany (Craven Stakes), Home Of The Brave (Free Handicap) and Muhaarar (Greenham Stakes). Gleneagles and Highland Reel, both trained by Aidan O\u2019Brien, lead the entries for the 2,000 Guineas . Roger Varian\u2019s impressive Newbury winner Intilaaq could still be supplemented to the Guineas. Connections would have to pay \u00a330,000 on Monday to add him to the line-up. One colt who is looking likely to be supplemented to the 2,000 Guineas field is Godolphin's Territories, who has pleased Andre Fabre since winning a Group Three at Longchamp. A statement on Godolphin\u2019s website quoted Fabre as saying: \u2018Territories has come out of his trial very well and has come on for the run. At this stage, a supplementary entry in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket is under serious consideration and we are 90% certain to take that route, subject to the horse continuing to please me.\u2019",

Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons has suffered another injury setback and may not play again this season . The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the Magpies' Under 21s against Derby on Wednesday . The Magpies declined to comment, but Aarons' loss would be yet another blow to head coach John Carver, who has seen his side defeated in each of its last five Barclays Premier League games amid a suspension and injury crisis which shows few signs of abating. Midfielder Moussa Sissoko was sent off during Monday night's loss at Liverpool to ensure his own enforced spell on the sidelines just as Carver prepares to welcome skipper Fabricio Coloccini back from a three-match ban. Carver can not call on striker Papiss Cisse, who has three more games to serve of his suspension, while Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett, Massadio Haidara, Cheick Tiote, Aarons and De Jong have all been missing for some time with most having kicked their last ball of the campaign. Newcastle had hoped Aarons' pace and direct approach would give them some fresh impetus with their season having careered to a halt in recent weeks.

Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 . The high point of Burnley's season, so far, is the 1-0 defeat of defending champions Manchester City .",

The red, worn chair will be removed from its enclosure at Dearborn's Henry Ford Museum and displayed in an open plaza on April 15 as part of the museum's observance of the assassination's 150 anniversary. Two days earlier, it will be onstage when renowned historian and Lincoln expert Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers a sold-out lecture at The Henry Ford. The chair in which Abraham Lincoln was shot has been on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, for 85 years. On April 15, it will be removed from its encasing to be displayed for the 150th anniversary of the assassination . Abraham Lincoln (left) was shot in Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. on April 14, 1865 by pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth (right). Lincoln died from his injuries the next day . The chair has a dark stain on the back, which many visitors believe to be blood from the shooting. But historians at the museum say that the stain is\u00a0oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before Lincoln . Lincoln's chair has been part of the museum started by pioneering automaker Henry Ford - no relation to the theater-owning Ford family - since its founding 85 years ago. The government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence, and it ended up at the Smithsonian Institution. The wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it, then sold it at auction to an agent working for Henry Ford. Henry Ford also bought the Logan County Courthouse where Lincoln practiced law in Illinois in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as Greenfield Village. For decades, the theater chair was housed in that courthouse. Around 1980, the chair was placed inside the museum, where it's now part of the 'With Liberty and Justice for All' exhibit. 'Lincoln was one of Henry Ford's heroes - when he decided he wanted to have this village, he wanted to collect Lincoln stuff as an educational tool,' said curator Donna Braden. 'The courthouse is pretty much the first thing Henry Ford acquired related to Lincoln and the chair came soon after.' A playbill from Our American Cousin from the night President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn . A copy of a hand colored 1870 lithographic print by Gibson & Co. provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows John Wilkes Booth shooting U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as he sits in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre . A copy of a 1865 lithographic print by Currier & Ives provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows the same event from a different angle . Many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are Lincoln's blood. Not so, say museum workers: The stains are oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before that fateful night when Lincoln was shot by a pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth. Steve Harris, a historic presenter at the museum, tells passers-by that Lincoln's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6ft, 4in tall. Taking in objects from the final hours of two important American lives is a major draw to the museum. The Henry Ford also owns the limousine President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was fatally shot in Dallas nearly a century later. Museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum, along with the bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement. Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. has arranged the presidential box identically to the way it was the night Lincoln was shot through the doorway . Abraham Lincoln's iconic silk top hat, which he was wearing the night he was assassinated, is part of the museum display at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Goodwin, author of 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,' told The Associated Press that the chair will offer an extra 'dimension' to her words and the experience of those in the room. 'There's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time,' she said. 'And hopefully, along with that, you're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile.' Museum visitor Jeff Buczkiewicz\u00a0stood before the chair, peered silently into the glass-enclosed case at the rocking chair, then snapped pictures for posterity . 'You just get drawn into these things,' said Buczkiewicz, 47, who came from suburban Chicago with his family to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. 'It is a tragic part of our history and our country. I think it's important to take it all in.' Milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo. About 8,000 people visited the limo on November 22, 2013, a free-admission day marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the Lincoln anniversary, which also has free admission. The single-shot Deringer pistol John Wilkes Booth used to kill Abraham Lincoln is displayed at the Center for Education and Leadership at Ford's Theatre in Washington . 'It really is about the power of the artifact,' said Patricia Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford, as the entire history attraction is known. 'It's less about the artifact itself than the symbolic nature of the artifact that represents a great paradigm change in the history of our country,' she added. Buskiewicz has also visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas where Kennedy was assassinated. 'You just have to try to take it in when you're in those areas,' he said, but he wonders 'why we gravitate' toward places and things associated with these types of events. Goodwin, whose book helped inspire Steven Spielberg's movie, 'Lincoln,' says that standing before iconic yet everyday objects provides a deep experience that transcends the moment that made them famous. 'In some ways, it's more familiar when it's a chair, a bus or a limo,' she said. 'There's something about the tangibility of these things.' The chair in which Lincoln was show is regularly displayed in an encasing at The Henry Ford Museum. For the 150th anniversary it will be taken out of the encasing .",

But for one New York-based writer, the urge to stand in front of a mirror and poke at and squeeze her pores for hours on end became so bad that it actually started 'sabotaging' her life. In an inspiring essay for\u00a0Marie Claire,\u00a0Jenna Marotta, 27, tells of her experience with dermatillomania - a\u00a0compulsive\u00a0skin-picking disorder that left her face bleeding - and how she managed to overcome it. 'I'd descend \"into the mirror\" for up to four hours a day,' Jenna writes in the essay, explaining how her actions horrified her parents. 'I would nick and squeeze and yank at every clogged pore on my face.' Scroll down for video . Obsessive behavior: Jenna Marotta, 27, of New York, says her habit of picking at the pores on her face was so all-consuming that it became 'self-sabotaging' At first, Jenna was just looking for a way to break out of her binge-eating routine. As a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch, then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home. Her binge-eating cycle continued through college and after graduation, when she moved back home to her parents' house in Illinois. 'I knew I was bingeing while I was bingeing,' she writes, adding that part of the problem was that she would head to the kitchen whenever she felt bored. 'So I decided to find a new place to spend my ample downtime.' That place became her parents' bathroom, where her mom kept a stainless steel 10x magnifying mirror and an array of Tweezerman tweezers. Jenna's use of the tweezers started off innocently enough, with her plucking out stray hairs along her eyebrows. Then she started to become obsessive, revisiting her brows several times a day and moving on to other areas of her face, where she would use those same tweezers to clear out pores and remove ingrown hairs. 'At one point, I became convinced that there was a lone dark hair trapped under my chin,' she says. 'I could think of nothing more vital than removing this growth from my face. In the process of freeing the (probably imagined) hair, I dug an eighth-inch deep hole.' Getting better: After accidentally going ten days without touching her pores when she forgot to pack her tweezers for a trip, Jenna managed to move away from her bad skin habit. She still sees a psychiatrist . Jenna was aware that her skin-picking was growing out of control and visited a 'battalion' of dermatologists, who told her that her problem was psychosomatic. So she enrolled in an an outpatient program for mental health. But once the three-week program ended, she insisted she had her problem under enough control to move on her own to New York City. The problem was not under control, however. Though the dreaded magnifying mirror was back at her parents' house in Illinois, Jenna would still lean in close to her own bathroom mirror to pick at her pores. 'I would tweeze and squeeze, filling my garbage can with tissues dotted with blood,' she writes, adding that she would hide out in her bedroom to avoid seeing her roommate, who might question her about the bloody tissues she threw out in the bathroom. And she didn't stop at using tweezers. Jenna admitted that she's also 'attacked' her face with an extruder, an earring post, an unspooled paperclip, a pushpin, a toothbrush handle, the rough side of a nail file, lotion caps, and nail clippers. One of Jenna's most agonizing memories was when the writer had to interview Steve Carrell after picking at a cyst on her chin until it bled. She worried the blood wouldn't dry in time to apply makeup before the interview. 'The urge to self-injure just always pulses through my head and hands,' she says. 'And it's my go-to method of procrastination when I have a deadline.' Luckily, while travelling to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this January, Jenna forgot her tweezers at home, resulting in ten whole days during which she didn't pick at her face. Now, the 27-year-old says she has overcome her condition - and is working on being 'nice' to herself. 'I continue to work with a psychiatrist to stay on track since I first put the tweezers down,' she says. Dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterized by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one's skin. Some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged. Sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body. The condition is often categorized as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). It can lead to bleeding, bruising and infections. CSP will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour. The skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels. However, once the damage has been done, those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness. Although the damage that is caused can be very severe, the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out CSP again and again. Treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. Source: Anxiety UK .",

Saurage later reported that the gator was safely hauled out of the pond, although it took a bit of work as it was being particularly 'aggressive'. Art Williams, of Groves, was the one who spotted the gator in his garden over Easter weekend. 'My wife and I are just going for a walk, with our new dog, and there's that 11 foot alligator just about 12 feet from us,' Williams told KBMT News. Williams said he's used to alligators being in the area, which is why he built a fence to keep them away from the pond where his grandchildren canoe. But he said this gator was no match for him or his DIY barrier. All hands on deck: Saurage later reported that the gator was safely hauled out of the pond, although it took a bit of work as it was being particularly 'aggressive' Williams called on the help of Saurage  to remove the massive animal, for everyone's safety. The beast was later confirmed as a male, around 35 to 40 years old. Saurage took the reptile back to his park to join more than 400 other alligators. He says there's no reason for people to fear the toothy lizards, as long as they keep a safe distance and never attempt to feed them. He points out that alligators can run 22 miles per hour on land and 'you can't run that fast.' Although it was big, Monday's catch wasn't Saurage's biggest.

Analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the Home Counties. The potential goldmine in the Weald Basin, across Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, could meet up to a third of Britain\u2019s oil demand within 15 years, according to the consortium exploring the area. Scroll down for video . UK Oil & Gas Investments say they have discovered 100billion barrels worth of oil reserves in the Weald Basin, near Gatwick airport (pictured, the well head at Horse Hill) A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . This could reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia and could be a major boost for British industry at a time when the North Sea supply is dwindling. But industry experts remained sceptical of the claims, with one describing them as \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. Since 1975, of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the UK North Sea, only 45billion have been pumped out. It is believed another 20billion barrels can be recovered before extraction becomes too difficult. Experts warned last night that only a fraction of the Weald Basin oil may be accessible for extraction. They also claimed fracking could be required to retrieve significant volumes. Stephen Sanderson, the chief executive of UKOG, said the site at Horse Hill was 'world class' and had the potential for 'significant daily oil production' at this proposed drilling site . Horse Hill Developments consortium made the discovery during test drilling in a well five miles from Gatwick Airport. UK Oil & Gas Investments, which has a 30 per cent stake, said \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile \u2013 equating to 100billion barrels across the basin. At current crude prices, this could be worth \u00a33.7trillion. Stephen Sanderson of UKOG, which insisted it would not use fracking, said: \u2018By 2030, we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the UK\u2019s oil demand from within the Weald area.\u2019 Neil Ritson, of fellow consortium firm Solo Oil, said it was of \u2018major economic significance\u2019. If flow tests showed oil could be extracted, the production process could begin within 18 months, he added. US firm Nutech, which conducted the tests, estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted \u2013 up to 15billion barrels. UKOG chairman David Lenigas said drilling in the Weald could create \u2018many thousands\u2019 of jobs. Although the exploration site covered 55 square miles out of 1,100, he said the consortium was confident the entire region was oil-rich. Works: The well is situated in this container on the proposed drilling site . Exploration: Experts are now trying to work out how much of the oil will be properly recoverable . Mr Lenigas dismissed suggestions it would be hard to extract from the site, saying the ground was limestone which acted \u2018like a big sponge\u2019 and that \u2018you can effectively suck the oil out\u2019. The Australian entrepreneur, who lives in Monaco, is a director of 16 British companies \u2013 and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices. UKOG shares soared after the firm claimed to have discovered a \u2018world-class potential resource\u2019. However, Professor Alastair Fraser, of Imperial College London, said the claims were \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. A study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region, while the British Geological Survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil. Discovery: The Horse Hill site near Gatwick in Sussex, where a large amount of oil has apparently been found . Drilling: Exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile . Development: The site is owned by a number of companies including UK Oil & Gas Investments . The professor added: \u2018The question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so.\u2019 Malcolm Graham-Wood, of oil consultants HydroCarbon Capital, suggested residents might object to rows of onshore oil wells, adding: \u2018The question is can it produce oil? It is extremely difficult with a very low recovery rate. This is potentially interesting but I wouldn\u2019t attribute any value yet.\u2019 But Mr Lenigas said: \u2018To all those people who say I am hiking up the share price, I am not. I am just saying what the Nutech report says \u2026 I feel passionate that this is globally significant for Britain.\u2019 A Department of Energy & Climate Change spokesman said: \u2018The Government welcomes any new information which expands our understanding of the potential of the Weald Basin.\u2019 There might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the Home Counties \u2013 but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits. The Government owns the land under your house \u2013 meaning homeowners have no right to any oil found beneath them. Once oil has been found, oil companies pay the Government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits. The Government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted. The only way an oil company would pay the surface landowner is if it wanted to base its drilling site on their land. However, firms that undertake fracking, which is seen as a more intrusive and controversial method of extracting oil than simply drilling, must sometimes agree to provide \u2018community benefits\u2019. This could include building a playground or school nearby the fracking site, and is seen as compensation for residents. Oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area, as well as gaining planning permission from the local council. Oil rush: The Weald Basin, of which Horse Hill is part, could contain a total of 100billion barrels . Mystery: It is not yet known how much of the area's oil will be easily recoverable . Boom: The Sussex countryside could soon be dotted with oil wells (file photo)",

The bat went flying and struck a fan sitting several rows behind the Cubs' on-deck circle in the face. Scroll down for video... Addison Russell was batting for the Chicago Cubs in the seventh inning during his first game at Wrigley Field . Russell, a rookie, swung at a first-pitch fastball and accidentally let the bat slip out of his fingers . The bat went flying and it ended up striking a fan who was sitting several rows behind the Cubs' on-deck circle . Cubs officials rushed to assist the spectator and towels from the home team's dugout were brought to the injured fan. Russell, who was ranked the No. 5 prospect in baseball earlier this month, said the bat 'just slipped', according to MLB. He said: 'I saw it connect with his face. 'I saw the dude's glasses fly, and it just wasn't pretty. I feel really bad. 'Words can't describe how bad I feel.' The rookie, 21, went 1-for-3 on Monday night and is batting .160 in six big league games for the Cubs . Russell, who was ranked the No. 5 prospect in baseball earlier in April, said the bat 'just slipped' from his hand . The fan suffered 'wounds' but was conscious and communicative after being hit, the Chicago Tribune\u00a0reported. The Cubs said the patient was transported to first aid, then transferred to an ambulance and taken to a nearby hospital. The club thanked everyone who shared their concern while updating the patient's status. If the fan feels comfortable around bats again after he's out of the hospital, Russell has one for him. He said: 'I found the bat in my locker, so if you see that guy out there, I'm willing to give him a bat and sign it. 'I feel terribly bad about it.' Russell went 1-for-3 on Monday night and is batting .160 in six big league games for the Cubs. The Cubs defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0.

With its large snout and blackened eyes, the furious-looking beast appeared to breath fire as it stared down from the sky in the bizarre cloud formation. Captured at dusk the red sky adds a fiery hue behind the clouded creature giving it an uncanny likeness to the legend of the fire breathing dragon slain by St George - ahead of the patron Saint of England's day tomorrow. The cloud dragon appears to breathe fire in these incredible images captured by amateur photographer Nicolas Locatelli . Amateur photographer Nicolas Locatelli, 20, snapped the unusual cloud in the sky above Briones Regional Park, in California\u00a0on a Nikon D7100. The student, from San Francisco said he didn't even notice the striking formation until he checked his camera when he got home. The image went viral on Reddit after his friends suggested he upload it to the social network. He only noticed that the red sky at dawn appeared to give a fiery hue behind the cloud formation after he got home and checked the pictures . The pictures, which create an uncanny likeness to the fire breathing dragon slain by St George, the patron Saint of England, were captured at dusk above Briones Regional Park, in California . Nicolas said: 'When I saw the image I was pretty intrigued. 'The way the sunset lit up the cloud at the mouth of the dragon made it look like flames were coming out of its mouth. 'The image was timed perfectly too. The image was taken with a zoom lens on a stormy day so the clouds were in the distance and moving quickly so I got really lucky taking this picture. 'The image was received very positively on Reddit. 'When my friends saw the image, I asked, 'what do you see in this picture?' and they said 'definitely a dragon breathing fire' and 'it's the dragon slain by St George.' 'I got a lot of positive and jovial feedback on the image.' A picture of the legend of St George and the Dragon . The medieval legend of St George and the dragon is over a thousand years old. St George travelled to Libya, where he met an old hermit who told him a dragon had long ravaged the country, demanding the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden every day. With the population of young girls decimated, the king's daughter alone remained to be sacrificed, unless a knight could slay the dragon. Determined to save the princess, he set out to slay the dragon, luring it from its cave upon his arrival. But after falling from his horse, St George evaded the dragon's attack by hiding under an enchanted orange tree before recovering his strength and killing the beast with his sword. The slaying of the dragon by St George, a brave Roman soldier who protested against the Romans' torture of Christians, was first credited to him in the twelfth century, long after his death. The real St George was thought to be a Roman soldier,\u00a0born to Christian parents in A.D. 270 in what is now Eastern Turkey. Adomn\u00e1n, the Abbot of Iona in Scotland, provides Britain\u2019s earliest recorded reference to Saint George in the 7th Century. He details the story of the Saint\u2019s exploits, which had been told to him by a French bishop named Arcuif who had travelled to Jerusalem with the crusaders . As the Crusaders returned to England from foreign shores, they brought with them tales of St George, and his reputation grew . A church in Fordington, Dorset, still records St George leading the Crusaders into battle. St George later resigned his military post and protested against Emperor Diocletian against his persecution of Christians . He was dragged through the streets and executed on April 23, 303 AD. Almost a millenia later in 1222 the Council of Oxford declared April 23rd to be St George\u2019s Day . It was not until 1348 that St George became the Patron Saint of England. Today April 23 is celebrated as a day of patriotism for England.",

The Tangerines' demotion into the third tier was finally confirmed on Easter Monday and that triggered pre-match public displays of fury from fans at the Oyston family's handling of the club on Tuesday. Dozens of supporters gathered outside the West Stand 45 minutes before kick-off and hurled eggs at the back of the directors' boxes before a flare, smoke bomb and firework were tossed into the cordoned-off area in front of the main reception area. Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead against Reading on Tuesday night . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Blackpool: Lewis (Parish 73); Hall (Maher 50), Clarke, O'Dea, Dunne; Cubero, O'Hara, Perkins, Orlandi (Osavi-Samuel 78), Jacobs; Madine . Goal: O'Hara (pen, 6) Booked: O'Hara . Reading: Federici; Gunter, Pearce, Knight, Obita; McCleary (Mackie 45), Ake, Norwood, Robson-Kanu; Yakubu (Cox 78), Appiah (Pogrebnyak 45) Goal: Hall \u00a0(OG, 46) Ref: G. Eltringham . Att: 9,614 . With stewards and police present, the scenes did not descend into violence but the message delivered from those in attendance was clear - they want Oyston to depart a team that this week became the first in the Football League to be relegated. On the pitch, Jamie O'Hara's early penalty was cancelled out by Grant Hall's unfortunate own goal just 20 seconds after the restart as the basement-dwelling Seasiders' winless run was extended to 13 games. Some of the supporters who congregated in front of the West Stand did not even walk into a half-empty stadium for the game and they missed their side taking a sixth-minute lead. Zat Knight got the wrong side of Sheffield Wednesday loanee Gary Madine and tripped him from behind, allowing O'Hara to step up and stroke the resulting penalty into the corner as Adam Federici guessed the wrong way. Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . The cut-up pitch arguably denied the hosts a second as the ball bobbled away from David Perkins, who had orchestrated a three-on-two break, on the edge of the Royals' penalty area. Winger Michael Jacobs then blasted into the side-netting from 25 yards as Blackpool entered the interval with a one-goal lead. That disappeared 20 seconds after the restart, though, when the Royals made a lightning start to the second period. Pavel Pogrebnyak made inroads down the left flank and he squared for Yakubu, whose shot back across goal smashed against the unfortunate Hall before going over the line. Hall stayed on the turf and after woozily returning to his feet, he was replaced by Niall Maher. Perkins bent an effort narrowly past a post but Joe Lewis and Federici remained largely untroubled, as did Blackpool substitute Elliot Parish when he replaced an injured Lewis, with Pogrebnyak's header off target the closest either side came to a winner. The result leaves Lee Clark's side on 25 points, still one point shy of the lowest points tally ever accumulated by a team in the second tier when there have been 24 teams competing.",

Mr Taylor said mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban, which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism, such as five-star hotels. He said the proposal had 'horrified' authorities in Bali. Mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban, which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism, such as five-star hotels . 'My own view would be that common sense would prevail... but I'd be cautious in saying that because there are some of the more pronounced religious groups throughout Indonesia really gaining momentum now,' Mr Taylor told AAP. 'In Aceh, they've introduced Sharia law. Very strictly. Even foreigners can be arrested in Aceh for not dressing appropriately.' Mr Taylor said nationalist sentiment was running high, with Indonesian authorities reviewing every property to ascertain whether it was being held on behalf of a foreigner. 'A lot of them are,' he said. 'The state will either resume that property or offer the nominee the option of just keeping it for themselves, with no legal comeback from the foreign owner. 'So if you take that and the alcohol thing I think it's really symptomatic of a disturbing trend - and Indonesia is a country that stole my heart so I'm not anti-Indonesia - of the Jokowi government showing all the signs of being naive, dysfunctional and lost at the moment.

Above, troops walk across the island in 1982 . Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina over the ownership of the islands. After nine months of exploratory drilling, a group of British companies found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands. The bonanza, which could be worth billions of pounds, will add to fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a \u2018very live threat\u2019 from Argentina. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations with Buenos Aires, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the islands. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said last night the find would lead to further claims by the Argentinians over the long-disputed territory in the South Atlantic. \u2018The rhetoric and sabre-rattling from Argentina will grow,\u2019 he added. \u2018The Argentinians have always been worried we will find oil and, given their economic state, they will think, \u201cWe should have it\u201d. \u2018We will have to be careful. The only way to stop them (acting) is to ensure we have sufficient military there. The rhetoric from Argentina will get worse.' Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands. Britain pledged last week to invest \u00a3180million over the next ten years to defend the islands, with an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year that Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. Scroll down for video . Yesterday\u2019s discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil industry expert and founder of the consultancy HydroCarbon Capital, said: \u2018This is good for Britain, good for British oil companies, good for taxes and good for the industry.\u2019 The latest incident sees a heightening of tensions between Argentina and Britain over the Falklands. Pictured is the bombing of the Sir Galahad Troop Carrier, after it was hit by a missile . A map shows the oil has been discovered 130 north of the island by British companies at the Zebedee oil well . Samuel Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, which is named after the southern rockhopper penguins found on the islands, said: \u2018This is a fantastic start to the 2015 Falklands drilling campaign and provides early proof of the significant remaining potential of the North Falkland Basin.\u2019 Shares in the oil-exploration companies initially soared to double digits after the discovery was announced. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by the oil find. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: \u2018Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically \u2013 look at Alaska, for instance \u2013 but that has never worried the oil industry.\u2019 Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was \u2018an excellent start to the exploration campaign\u2019. It follows another made nearby in 2012 through a project called Sea Lion, but the price of oil has halved since June, forcing many explorers to cut back on spending. Experts also predict future finds could be even more significant. Stephane Foucaud, oil analyst at First Energy, said the latest discovery is \u2018encouraging news\u2019, but another well \u2013 called Isobel Deep, 15 miles to the south \u2013 is the \u2018most important\u2019 in the area. War veterans sing the national anthem and hold the Argentinian flag during a ceremony marking the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Falklands War. Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in \u2018ageing infrastructure\u2019 and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system. It came after news that Russian president Vladimir Putin was reportedly working on a deal to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 bombers to Argentina. Intelligence chiefs warned that Argentina could land forces on a remote island, and that commanders needed support helicopters to enable infantry to react to any threat.",

Kate and William\u00a0leaving the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, with their newborn son, Prince George in 2013.

Alice is the name of the Queen's aunt, who passed away in 2004 aged 102, while Charlotte is favoured as a nod to William's father Charles. According to the newspaper, if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James, with the second favourite name being Alexander. Many people are hoping for a girl though - of the 2,200 people polled, a quarter said they wanted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to have a female baby, with only three percent hoping for a younger brother for George. Diana is the favourite name for the second royal baby, name after Williams mother - the late Princess Of Wales . The choices were echoed on social media today, with many Twitter users claiming they would be delighted if Kate and William decided to name the baby after his mother. One user called Danielle O'Donoghue wrote: 'If Kate Middleton has a baby girl and doesn't name her Diana I'll be so upset. Another said: 'If the new royal baby is a girl and is called Diana, either first name or middle name. I will be 90% more emotional.'

Lawyers have warned that the differences in defamation law in Northern Ireland mean controversial US expose HBO's 'Going Clear' might not be broadcast by Sky Atlantic. The Alex Gibney-directed film, which alleges abusive practices at the religion's US headquarters, was due to premiere in the UK earlier this month to coincide with its American release. But the fact that Northern Ireland is not subject to the 2013 Defamation Act means Sky is set to postpone or cancel the show entirely, according to the Observer. Scroll down for video . A hard-hitting Scientology documentary slammed by John Travolta (pictured at a gala for the church in 2013) is unlikely to be aired in the UK because of fears that the broadcaster could be exposed to libel claims . This is because it could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists. It mirrors the decision taken by British publishers Transworld to cancel their release of Lawrence Wright's Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief, on which the film is based. Hollywood star John Travolta slammed the film and said his decades of personal experience at the church have been positive. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times\u00a0he said: 'I've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years...that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative.' The documentary claims to have revealed secrets about the church of Scientology, pictured is headquarters . Lawyers have warned that the show could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists such as Tom Cruise, pictured at a conference . The programme would be shielded by libel laws in Britain which state that people or organisations must now show 'serious harm' to reputation. But the same documentary would be\u00a0exposed to pre-reform libel laws in Northern Ireland because\u00a0Sky is unable to differentiate its signal between regions for technical reasons. Sky has maintained the decision is a delay rather than a cancellation. A spokesman said:\u00a0'At present, Sky's transmission date for Going Clear has not been confirmed.' The church has condemned the film as a 'one-sided, bigoted propaganda built on falsehoods' and informed by former members \u2013whom it calls 'misfits'. It is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast. The church said in a statement: 'The Church of Scientology will be entitled to seek the protection of both UK and Irish libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions.' Going Clear examines the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, the church's finances and its relationships with celebrities such as Tom Cruise and  Travolta. Libel lawyer Paul Tweed, who was involved in previous discussion with UK publisher Transworld, which dropped Going Clear, said a decision to broadcast would be based on commercial reasons. The church is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast, pictured is leader\u00a0David Miscavige . Alex Gibney (left) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members including Paul Haggis (right) 'Any client of mine, whether a journalist or a high-profile personality, is entitled to protect their reputation against false allegations,' he said. 'In terms of Sky's decision \u2026 they have to make absolutely certain that what they are broadcasting is not defamatory or untrue. If they have right on their side, they have nothing to fear.' Going Clear has been seen by more than 5.5 million people in the US and is likely to become second only to a film about Beyonc\u00e9 as HBO\u2019s most-watched documentary of the past decade. In a comment piece in the Los Angeles Times last week director Mr Gibney said: 'In the past, critics of the church have called for its tax exemption to be revoked because it is not a 'real religion'. I agree that tax-exemption isn't merited, but not for that reason. 'The Church of Scientology has a distinct belief system which, despite its somewhat strange cosmology \u2013 mocked by the TV show South Park and many others \u2013 is not essentially more strange than, say, the idea of a virgin birth. 'Scientologists are entitled to believe what they want to believe. And the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] website makes it clear anyone is entitled to start a religion without seeking IRS permission. To maintain the right to be tax-exempt, however, religions must fulfil certain requirements for charitable organisations. For example, they may not 'serve the private interests of any individual' and/or 'the organisation's purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy'.'",

The man was identified later as Sid Ahmed Ghlam, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told television broadcaster TF1. Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said Ghlam asked for medical help at his home in Paris' 13th district Sunday morning, claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon. But authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh. Molins said Ghlam was someone suspected of killing a 32-year-old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger-scale terror attack in the near future. \"(He) let them believe that he was the victim,\" French President Francois Hollande said Wednesday. \"But police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated.\" That probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect's car. Based on this discovery \"and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual,\" they looked inside the car and found a loaded Kalashnikov gun, a 9-mm revolver, three cell phones, a laptop, a USB key, a satellite navigation system \"and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets,\" Molins said. A search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence, including three more Kalashnikovs, three bulletproof vests, police armbands, a camera, some 2,000 euros in cash and \"documents in Arabic mentioning al Qaeda and ISIS,\" according to the prosecutor. \"A terrorist attack has been foiled,\" Hollande said. \"It's not the first time.\" Earlier Ghlam was identified as a computer science student originally from Algeria. According to Molins, he lived in that North African country until 2001, joined his parents in France for the next two years, then went back to Algeria. He got his undergraduate degree in that nation, then returned to France to study electronics. He'd never been convicted of a crime; in fact, the lone accusation against him in August 2013 was later withdrawn. But that didn't mean French authorities didn't know about Ghlam. \"He had been noticed wishing to go to Syria,\" Molins explained. The prosecutor added that authorities found nothing to suggest he was imminent threat, \"but he was under surveillance.\" Law enforcement checked on the man once in 2014 and again this year, Cazeneuve said. The minister said the man planned to head to Syria, a country embroiled in a bloody, years-long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like ISIS. There was no indication he ever made it. But, Molins said, computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in Syria who \"asked him to target a church.\" What church? Authorities didn't disclose that detail on Wednesday, though Molins did say \"this target was confirmed by (the suspect's satellite navigation system) and handwritten documents in his car.\" Paris is home to the famed Notre Dame cathedral and Sacre Coeur basilica, both huge draws for tourists. It's not known if either were in line to be attacked, but Prime Minister Manuel Valls Wednesday visited one of the churches allegedly targeted, which was located in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Assuming Ghlam doesn't walk free anytime soon -- for now, he's in custody awaiting possible charges -- that attack won't happen anytime soon. But authorities say he's already claimed at least one victim. Her name is Aurelie Chatelain. The 32-year-old was found dead Sunday morning sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in Villejuif, killed by a single bullet that struck her shoulder, went through her body and ended up embedded in the seat. Cazeneuve said Chatelain was the mother of a 5-year-old girl and had come to the region on Saturday to attend a training class. It's not known what connection, if any, she had with the suspect. Nonetheless, Molins said that ballistics, DNA, satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of Chatelain, who Molins called the region's first victim of terrorism since January. That's when the massacre at Charlie Hebdo's offices and the siege of a kosher market in Paris took place, prompting French authorities to beef up security measures. \"France, like other countries, is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude,\" Valls said. \"... Terrorists are targeting France to divide us.\" CNN's Jethro Mullen, Andrew Carey, Sandrine Amiel and Ariana Williams contributed to this report.",

When Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on TV today to insist none of the country\u2019s troops are positioned in the Ukraine, he looked decidedly fresh-faced for a man accused of war-mongering. The wrinkles on the 62-year-old's forehead, clearly visibly in previous pictures, have disappeared, while his skin look smooth, taut, tanned and younger than ever. Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has had cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes, wrinkles and make his face more chiseled . His appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 (left) and 2010 (right). In both photographs the skin of Putin's face is more saggy, and he has visible dark circles under his eyes . And as this series of pictures show, the Russian president's face has changed dramatically over the years \u2013 amid persistent rumours he has undergone cosmetic surgery to give himself a more youthful look. A black and white picture taken in 1991 when he was 37 years old shows him looking gaunt, and black bags under his eyes are clearly visible. Putin, pictured in 1985 (left) with his wife Lyudmila and daughter Katya, and in 1991 (right) when he was chairman of the External Relations Committee of Saint Petersburg, aged 37. His hair was already receding . Pictures taken in 2000 (left) and 2001 (right), when Putin was in his forties, also show 'crow's-feet' on his eyes . During his first term at President in 2007 Putin, then aged 55, looked his age while still healthy . In a photo dated 2000, Putin\u2019s hair still has tones of blonde but the signs of ageing are becoming more apparent on his features. Fast-forward to 2010, and the 'action man', now 57, looks tired and haggared after taking part in a judo session . Questions over whether Putin had gone under the knife came to the fore in 2011, when the then-Prime Minister was photographed with a yellow bruise on his face. Russian media began to question whether Putin had had plastic surgery in 2011. Pictured here announcing his intentions to run to become the President of Russia, journalists wondered if that bid sparked the surgery . Putin's face was puffy but relatively wrinkle-free in December 2013 when he attended a conference in Moscow . Plastic surgeons at the time told MailOnline that Botox injections, a facelift, cheek-fillers, a brow lift and removal of the bags under his eyes would have helped improve his ageing features \u2013 although his spokesman denied at the time he had had any work done. But In the same year he announced he wanted to become the next President of Russia, leading commentators to ask if that was the reason behind his new look. In December 2013, after around two years in office as President, he looked vastly different again, his face puffy but wrinkle-free. And in March this year, the Kremlin was forced to deny rumours that he was unwell \u2013 or had undergone surgery \u2013 when the President disappeared for 10 days, cancelling a string of appointments and public appearances. Questions were raised about Putin's health when he met with the President of Kyrgystan last month after a 10 day disappearance. He refused to explain where he had been saying 'it would be boring without gossip' Putin, pictured on April 16 2014 - looking relaxed and youthful as he give a television interview about Ukraine . When he emerged to meet with the President of Kyrgystan\u00a0his face was puffy and shiny, and eyes only able to partially open, leading journalists to wonder about the cause of his new look. However Putin has remained tight-lipped about his absence, laughing off the suggestions of poor health - or rumours that he had been attending the birth of a love child - saying; 'It would be boring without gossip.' His latest appearance is unlikely to quell suggestions that Putin has been knocking on the doors of plastic surgeons. Putin was recently reported as saying he won't be in office past the year 2024, when he will turns 71 years old - although these pictures suggest there is a good chance he won't look it.",

There is no point of trying to hurt him as he hurt because it can't be done. All we can do, all you can do is make the best choice.\" Bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from: death, or life in prison without any possibility of parole. \"We are asking you to punish Jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life.\" Showing the court a photo of the federal Supermax prison in Colorado, Bruck said: . \"This is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but aren't anymore. ... He goes here and he's forgotten. No more spotlight, like the death penalty brings. \"No interviews with the news media, no autobiography, no messages from Jahar on the Internet. No nothing. \"No martyrdom. Just years and years of punishment, day after day, as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did. \"The evidence will show that if you sentence Jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did, you'll both punish him and protect society.\" Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell, 29; Lingzi Lu, 23; Martin Richard, 8; and Sean Collier, 26. In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison, jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors, such as his relative youth, mental health and family background, and whether or not he is remorseful. He has shown no emotion as he sits in court, and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead. Last week, federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony, including an array of images showing the victims as happy, active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion, screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant, where Richard and Lu died. Lead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was 26, died in a gunbattle with Watertown, Massachusetts, police three days after the bombings. Clarke's colleague, Bruck, began that narrative in his opening statement by noting, \"The man who conceived, planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left. \"He was 19, nearly 20. But he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer. And an age when people make horribly bad, destructive decisions. What each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor.\" Bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing Tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point. \"I could almost hear you gasp\" when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims, Bruck said. \"It turned out that shocking gesture wasn't quite as advertised. \"What did he mean? It meant he was acting as an immature 19-year-old.\" Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend, but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives, who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel, apparently do not include his parents, who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15, 2013, bombings. Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang, a sociologist, to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed. Under federal law, the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life. The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings.",

So it is appropriate that at least two of Cournswood's long-term residents have had strong Bletchley connections. The first was wartime Naval cryptographer and Enigma codebreaker Dillwyn Knox, who bought it in 1921 and lived there until his death in 1943. His funeral was attended by many from Bletchley Park, and a memorial stone to Knox can be found bordering the property. Cournswood House is in the south of Buckinghamshire \u2013 in ten acres of secluded woodlands in the picturesque village of North Dean . Bletchley connections: Codebreaker Dillwyn Knox, left, who bought it in 1921 and lived there until his death in 1943 and right, Sharon\u00a0Constancon, who is related to the Leon family who once owned Bletchley Park . And the current owner, businesswoman Sharon Constancon, is related to the Leon family who once owned Bletchley Park. 'I only discovered this when I went on a visit to Bletchley Park with my uncle,' says Sharon. 'The Leon family donated the building to the Government in 1937 for use as a code-breaking centre.' While both are in Buckinghamshire, Cournswood House is in the south of the county \u2013 in ten acres of secluded woodlands in the picturesque village of North Dean \u2013 while Bletchley Park is in the town of Bletchley in the north, 20 miles away. During the Second World War at Bletchley Park, Dillwyn Knox led the team that made the first breaks into the code Germany was using, and he encouraged Alan Turing \u2013 the subject of The Imitation Game \u2013 in his work there. Although Knox does not feature in the new movie, he was portrayed by actor Richard Johnson in the 1996 television film Breaking The Code, which starred Derek Jacobi as Turing and Prunella Scales as his wife Sara. The pool is in a glasshouse, where vines thrive in the heated environment.\u00a0A separate glasshouse houses the Jacuzzi and a herb garden . Cracking mysteries seems to be something Knox enjoyed in his private life too, as novelist Agatha Christie was a good friend and often visited Cournswood. 'I fell in love with Cournswood House the moment I saw it,' says Sharon, who bought it in 2003. 'It's an outstanding property with lots of potential.' Apart from the main house, there are two cottages, offices, a swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym, and woodland with lakes, Japanese-style bridges, waterfalls and fountains. The pool is in a glasshouse, where vines thrive in the heated environment. 'The grapes are perfect for making chutney,' says Sharon. A separate glasshouse houses the Jacuzzi and a herb garden. Price: \u00a34million . Location: North Dean, Buckinghamshire . Bedrooms: 5 . Unique features: Office suite, indoor swimming pool, two cottages, Jacuzzi, gym, grass tennis court, former home of wartime codebreaker Dillwyn Knox . There are five bedrooms, four bathrooms (two en suite) and five reception rooms. The large drawing room has high ceilings, ornate cornicing and a fireplace with carved wooden mantel and surround. Double doors open on to a triple-tiered terrace, with an open barbecue, that overlooks the lakes and woodlands. In the dining room, solid parquet flooring continues through to the serving room, reached through a pair of oak double doors. The modern kitchen is a chef's delight, with Gaggenau and Miele ovens. In the centre is an island incorporating a breakfast bar and storage units. 'I love entertaining and the kitchen offers everything you could possibly want,' says Sharon. The reception hall features a sweeping staircase to the first floor, where there are the bedrooms and bathrooms as well as two dressing rooms and a TV/cinema room. The master bedroom opens on to a circular balcony with stunning views over the gardens, lakes and woods. In the library, still concealed behind one of the wall panels, is Knox's private safe. One of the property's cottages overlooks the lakes, while the other is on the edge of the woods. 'Both cottages are ideal for short- or long-term lets or for staff, friends or family visits,' says Sharon. At the entrance to the property there are electric gates with majestic stone golden eagles perched on top of pillars. 'I'm moving to downsize,' says Sharon. 'I'll miss the privacy, security and tranquillity, not to mention the wildlife, such as deer, red kites and ducks.' hamptons-int.com, 01494 611313 .",

Judges gave the award to The Mail on Sunday ahead of fellow nominees The Sunday Times and Independent on Sunday, saying such a rare feat was \u2018fully deserved by a paper where journalistic excellence across the board has led to commercial as well as journalistic success\u2019. They also praised our all-round quality that, week after week, sets the agenda and forces daily newspapers to chase our big exclusives. The Mail on Sunday was voted Sunday Newspaper of the Year for a third year in a row. Ben Ellery's report which revealed the truth about Ed Miliband's feminist t-shirts earned a Scoop of the Year nomination . Our most spectacular front page revealed how feminist T-shirts worn by Ed Miliband and Harriet Harman were made in Mauritius by migrant women workers on 62p an hour\u2026 a report which also earned a nomination for Scoop of the Year for reporter Ben Ellery. Other brilliant stories last year included the investigation that caused Fiona Woolf to quit as chairman of the historic child abuse inquiry; how police spied on our journalists\u2019 phone records to compromise sources; comic Michael McIntyre\u2019s secret family tragedy; the Elisabeth Murdoch/Matthew Freud divorce; and the first interview with Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans after he was cleared of gay rape. But that\u2019s not all: our formula for success includes two superb magazines, a fabulous pullout sport supplement; the biggest puzzles section of any newspaper; and top columnists including Liz Jones, Piers Morgan, Peter Hitchens, Rachel Johnson and Chris Evans. Literary critic Craig Brown, winner of countless awards in the past, was nominated this time as Arts Reviewer of the Year. Literary critic Craig Brown, left, was nominated this time as Arts Reviewer of the Year and reporter Ben Ellery, right, earned a Scoop of the Year nomination . The awards were presented at a lunch at London\u2019s Stationers\u2019 Hall, where MI5 director-general Andrew Parker gave a keynote speech. The Daily Mail was nominated in the daily newspaper category. The Mail on Sunday\u2019s commercial success saw sales outperform the rest of the Sunday market, with our market share reaching a new record of 21.9 per cent. The Mail on Sunday is poised to become the biggest-selling Sunday paper \u2013 amazing for a mid-market paper \u2013 and last month was just 31,000 copies behind the red-top Sun.

They were all defeated by a native who likes eating snow and watching turtles. A 2-year-old dog from Des Moines named Tank won the 36th annual Beautiful Bulldog contest Sunday at Drake University. Scroll down for video . Winner: Tank, a 2-year-old bulldog from Iowa won Drake University's 36th annual 'Beautiful Bulldog' contest Sunday . A real beauty: Tank, who enjoys eating snow and watching turtles, will now serve as mascot of this year's Drake Relays . Tank received top honors as well as a crown and cape. He will appear before more than 16,000 fans -- or, royal subjects -- at the university's Drake Relays to be honored as mascot of the event, which will be held from Thursday through Saturday, according to the contest's\u00a0website. The tongue-in-cheek beauty pageant, which featured 50 dogs, is the kickoff event for the Drake Relays track meet. 'He's funny,' said Tank's owner, Duane Smith. 'He's a real good one.' Pageant organizers narrowed a pool of more than 100 hopeful pups by a lottery held last month. Owner: Here, Tank enjoys a rub from his owner, Duane Smith, after winning the 36th annual contest . Judges weren't looking for beauty though. They wanted to see the slobber, drool and bulging, bloodshot eyes synonymous with English bulldogs. They got all that and more from Tank \u2014 who now willingly shares his house with a Pomeranian and some turtles after Smith found him on Craigslist a year ago. Should Tank be unable to fulfill his duties as the Drake Relays mascot, fellow Des Moines pup Steve will step in. Steve was second even though he was initially so shy about the makeshift catwalk set up on Drake's basketball court that his owner had to pick him up and plunk him down, much to the delight of the few thousand spectators on hand. Pageant: The tongue-in-cheek beauty pageant, which featured 50 dogs, is the kickoff event for the Drake Relays track meet . Bex in a tutu: Ronnie Sussman, of Union, N.J., walks her dog Bex across the stage during the contest as part of the Drake Relays . There also was a 'Best Dressed' winner in Linus the Lovebug \u2014 who had to be dragged around in a wagon because of arthritic legs \u2014 and the congeniality award went to a dog named Princess Mabel. If there was an award for driving the furthest to enter the contest it would've gone to Ronnie Sussman and her dog Bex, who drove 17 hours from Union, New Jersey. Sussman and Bex will go home empty-handed, but she said the trip was more than worth it. 'This is just like a bucket list item of life for me,' Sussman said.",

The seal cull even takes place during the animals' breeding season - meaning that some cubs are being left to fend for themselves when their mothers are shot dead. Farmers say the seal killings are essential to stop the animals from destroying fish stocks off the coast of Scotland and northern England, but campaigners insist there are more humane methods of protecting fish. Warning: graphic images . Killed: This picture shows two seals shot in Crovie, north-east Scotland in an attempt to protect fish stocks . Shot: A seal killed near Blackpool; it is legal to cull seals without a licence in England . The practice of seal clubbing in Canada has long been regarded with revulsion around the world - but many Britons may be unaware that the animals are also being killed in the UK. Supporters of the practice claim that seals threaten farmed salmon, wild fish around the coasts and fish which are kept for sporting purposes. Figures from the Scottish government show that 205 seals were legally killed in Scottish waters last year by farmers, fishermen and angling firms. Some campaigners suggest that the real number of dead seals is much higher, as the official figure only includes those which were recorded to the authorities by people who had previously obtained licences. Fishermen have been given licences to kill more than 800 seals this year, although typically marksmen kill only around a quarter of the seals which can legally be culled. Trussed up: Two dead seals which have been thrown in the back of a van after being culled . Disposal: A van winches away the body of a seal after it was shot dead in Crovie to protect fish . Marksman: A gunman waits for the appearance of seals which could threaten stocks of salmon . Activists have called on consumers to more careful about buying Scottish salmon in supermarkets and fishmongers, encouraging them to investigate the origins of their fish. 'People who are horrified by what's happening in places like Norway and Scotland don't realise this is happening on their own doorstep,' said Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. 'The shooting tends to go on in remote locations, so it's not something most people tend to come across. Unlike in some countries, seals are not hunted in the UK for their skin, fur or meat. However, fishermen and farmer are allowed to kill seals which they believe are threatening fish stocks. In Scotland, they must get a licence which restricts the number of animals they can legally kill. But in the rest of Britain, there are no legal restrictions on culling seals, meaning people are free to do as they please. 'It's very simple - ask your retailer before you buy Scottish salmon whether seals were shot in the production of that salmon. 'Not every fish farmer is shooting seals, it's perfectly possible to protect fish without shooting seals.' He insisted that there is no need to cull seals in order to keep them away from fish stocks, saying that acoustic deterrents and strong nets can protect salmon just as well. Around three quarters of farms where seals are killed are certified by the RSPCA as 'Freedom Food' farms, Mr Ottaway added, saying that the animal protection charity should do more to crack down on the practice. He also called on the Scottish government to toughen up its licensing regime, which states that seals should only be killed as a 'last resort'. Mr Ottaway said: 'It's not the last resort if they're not using the best possible deterrents and the best possible nets. 'They recognise the value of seals as a tourist attraction, but have no problem with shooting them.' Threatened: British seal pups could starve if their mothers are shot dead (file photo) Protection: You need a licence to kill seals in Scotland but not in other parts of the UK (file photo) Because there are no restrictions on when farmers can kill seals if they have a licence, breeding mothers are likely to die, leaving their cubs unable to fend for themselves. Outside Scotland, it is legal to kill seals without any need for a licence - meaning that there is no way of measuring exactly how many die every year. The Scottish salmon industry, which produces annual export of \u00a3285million, insists that it is necessary to kill seals in order to protect farms. Scott Landsburgh of the Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation told the Daily Mirror: 'We have championed deterrence techniques that are designed to keep seals away from our fish, and shooting is always last resort. 'When a determined seal attacks fish in our pens it can kill and damage large numbers and it is important that we do whatever we can to reduce the chances of this happening.' A spokesman for the Scottish government said: 'Scottish seals are now better protected than ever before. Since 2011 it has been illegal in Scotland to shoot a seal except as a last resort under strict licensing conditions, and the number of seals shot under licence has more than halved since then.'",

The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual\u00a0survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound clich\u00e9, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores .

A relative of Britain's youngest convicted terrorist is believed to be among two  teenagers who have fled into Syria to join Isis. The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. One of the boys is believed to be a relation of Hammaad Munshi, who was just 15 when he joined a cell of Islamic fanatics targeting the Royal Family. The grandson of a British sharia judge, Munshi was recruited by a leading 'cyber terrorist' who radicalised impressionable Muslims and encouraged them to attend military camps in Pakistan. He was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the\u00a0Terrorism Act in 2008. The Times\u00a0reported that the two 17-year-old boys told relatives that they were going on a school trip, but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers\u2019 families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. Scroll down for video . 'Seeking jihad': Two teenage boys from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are believed to have fled to Syria to join Isis militants, seen here taking control of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus . After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. He was arrested as he walked home from school after an exam. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. Khan was found guilty of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism but cleared of a similar charge. A third man, Sultan Muhammad from Manningham, West Yorkshire - Khan's cousin - was convicted of three similar charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.",

Both Democrats are toying with a presidential run, both are facing long odds in that endeavor, and both shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night. But, as was evident at the dinner, that is where the similarities end. O'Malley is a former mayor and Maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand. Webb, on the contrary, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Virginia who comes across as more stoic and, at times, uncomfortable with retail politics. Before the event, O'Malley confidently cruised the union hall. He took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances. \"It is a marathon, not a sprint,\" one man told O'Malley, a nod to his long odds in the 2016 Democratic nomination process. \"Yes, it is; it's a marathon,\" O'Malley responded. \"Welcome to Iowa,\" said another man. \"We hope to see you here more.\" O'Malley smiled, \"Thanks a lot. I hope you do, too.\" Webb wasn't nearly as active, opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him. As Webb cut into his sizable helping of pork, O'Malley was standing directly behind him, shaking hands. The former Virginia senator, after possibly seeing O'Malley making the rounds, did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard Democratic activists in the room. \"Seven months old,\" Zach Smith, a new father, said of his baby boy, Noah. \"I have a bunch of kids. The youngest one is 8 years old,\" Webb said. The baby looked up at the senator. \"He is pretty calm,\" Webb remarked, himself calm. Despite coming from bordering states, Webb and O'Malley don't know each other. When they passed each other in a Des Moines hotel lobby on Friday morning, it was the first time the two had met. That said, the two Democrats find themselves in the same position. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid Sunday, leads every national and state poll of the Democratic field. She has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination. O'Malley and Webb are both looking up at her. In a March CNN/ORC poll (PDF) of national Democrats, only 1% said O'Malley and Webb were their top choice. In a January poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register (PDF), O'Malley was at 1% among Iowa Democrats, while Webb found himself at 3%. The speaking portion of the night further showed Webb and O'Malley's differences. Webb, who spoke before the governor, gave a more subdued, biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president: Basic governance, economic justice and criminal justice reform. To the approval of the audience, Webb promised to come back to Iowa regularly. \"I am committing to you right now,\" he said, \"we are going to go over the whole state.\" And the biggest applause came near the end of his speech, when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues. \"Money is ruining our political process,\" Webb said to a chorus of applause and \"hear hear.\" O'Malley, on the other hand, gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines. At points, the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands. \"When the American Dream is denied, our lives shrink, our hopes fade, and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear,\" O'Malley said, delivering the same stump speech he usually gives. \"To make the dream true again, we must fight for better wages for all workers, so that Americans can support their families on what they earn.\" As the event wound down, Webb and O'Malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people. O'Malley, who spent the previous day in Iowa, left Friday night for New York. Webb, who is in the midst of a four-day trip to Iowa, stayed in Des Moines and headlined a veterans event on Saturday morning in Waterloo. Webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event. He told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans. He also touted his work on passing the 21st Century G.I. Bill of Rights, a 2008 act that expanded education benefits for veterans, and stressed that more needed to be done. \"You want the next greatest generation, give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had,\" Webb said to applause. \"If you really want to thank them, hire a vet.\" After the event, Webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny Saturday morning. Asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, Webb smiled. Skepticism of retail politics is not new for Webb. As a one-term Democratic senator, Webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning, namely fundraising and retail politics. This time, he put on a rosy view. \"This is the good part of it, \"Webb said, with a laugh. \"Talking to the media, that is not always the good part.\"",

Horrified guests dived for cover as the groom's brother lost control of the gun at a reception in the capital Riyadh. Firing guns in the air is a traditional way of celebrating special occasions in some parts of Saudi Arabia and despite government efforts to stop it, the dangerous practice lingers on. Shotgun wedding: The groom's brother was caught on camera as he lost control of a Kalashnikov while firing a celebratory round into the air . Banging start: As the man starts shooting, he loses control of the rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street over the wedding guest . The incident was caught on camera, and the short clip shows the wedding party making its way towards the wedding hall when suddenly the brother of the groom starts shooting in the air. As he fires off the celebratory round, he loses control of the Kalashnikov rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street. Once he stops shooting, the video shows the guests attempt to reform a queue and act as if nothing untoward had happened, while  resuming their slow procession to the wedding. The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times. Several online commentators criticise the gunman, calling him irresponsible and unable to hold his rifle right. Bad move:\u00a0The procession was making its way towards the ceremony when the man started shooting . Bad aim: The round accidentally hits the wall as the wedding procession walks and bullets ricochet . The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times . User KhalifASakar wrote: 'It was highly irresponsible on his part. If he was so keen on his kind of jubilation, he should do it in an open space away from people. 'Even though I do not know much about firearms, I can tell you he was not holding his Kalashnikov correctly.' Another, Byzanti, said: 'The police should use the video clip to identify the brother and apply the law. 'As long as there is no punishment, people will continue to act irresponsibly. Those who attempt to show off their firearm skills are usually cowards in real action.' Abu Atab posted: 'The Kalashnikov man should be tied up alongside the family sheep until the wedding is over.' The Saudi government has been calling for an end to the local tradition of firing guns into the air to celebrate weddings and birthdays, which has often resulted in accidental deaths. A government spokesman said: 'Security agencies have been told to monitor wedding halls and places of celebration to prevent this sort of thing happening. 'Those that break the law will be severely punished. We are aware of this video and relevant authorities are looking into it.'",

Traumatised after months of rape and torture at the hands of ISIS militants, some of victims have returned after falling pregnant by their captors and further at risk at being ostracised by their community, which frowns upon pre-marital sex. Now, some Kurdish doctors are allegedly performing illegal abortions and secret surgeries to 'reverse loss of virginity' on the victims, some of whom are as young as eight, the Sunday Times reports. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of Yazidi girls and women, some as young as eight, were kidnapped by ISIS last year, and have since been held as sex slaves in the Islamic State . Horrifying tale: This 15-year-old Yazidi girl is one of hundreds of former ISIS sex slaves who have managed to escape the Islamic State and now face the difficult task of re-entering the strict religious community . The young girls, some barely teenagers, are some of around 40,000 people kidnapped at gunpoint when Islamic State fighters attacked Yazidi villages last summer. The women who have escaped now face being shunned by their strict religious communities, and many are erase to hide the physical evidence of their time in captivity, Hala Jaber writes in the Sunday Times. Some Yazidi girls are secretly undergoing abortions, banned in Kurdistan even in cases of rape, and seeking hymen surgery to 'reverse the loss of virginity'. A recent study by Human Rights watch has found that ISIS fighters have been kidnapping women and children as young as eight, forcing them to marry and convert to Islam and raping them repeatedly. Around 40,000 people were kidnapped at gunpoint when Islamic State fighters attacked Yazidi villages last summer. Yazidi women and girls have been separated from their families, forced to convert to Islam and repeatedly raped by ISIS fighters, the study from Human Rights Watch says. Their actions amount to war crimes. it adds . The names of Yazidi women were selected from a lottery for men to rape, a survivor told the charity . Yazidi children as young as eight have been abducted from their homes in northern Iraq, raped by ISIS fighters and forced into marriage. One child interviewed said she was 'owned' and raped by seven different men . Hundreds have been able to return, either by fleeing or being set free by ISIS, and many young women who has been held as sex slaves. Their terrifying campaign of systematic rape was tantamount to war crimes - and possibly crimes against humanity, the report adds. Human Rights Watch has collected the accounts of 20 women and girls who escaped from ISIS, which they say shows a system of organised rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery and forced marriage \u2013 acts that constitute war crimes. Now they are urging that survivors get the medical and psychological treatment that they need to cope with the unimaginable trauma they suffered. A 31-year-old Yazidi woman named Rashida told the charity she was told by her brother to commit suicide if she was unable to escape the ISIS fighters who had captured her. \u2018Later that day they made a lottery of our names and started to choose women by drawing out the names', the 31-year-old said. \u2018The man who selected me, Abu Ghufran, forced me to bathe but while I was in the bathroom I tried to kill myself. \u2018I had found some poison in the house, and took it with me to the bathroom. I knew it was toxic because of its smell. \u2018I distributed it to the rest of the girls and we each mixed some with water in the bathroom and drank it. None of us died but we all got sick.\u2019 Rape and other forms of sexual violence committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war. These women were part of a group of 216 Yazidis who were recently released by ISIS after being captured last year . Another woman, identified as Dilara, said she was taken to a wedding hall in Syria where ISIS fighters told the group to forget their relatives and prepare to marry them and bear their children. From 9:30am in the morning, men would come to buy girls to rape them. The survivors' stories come as United Nations (UN) investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report in March describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists. It suggested they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, according to investigators. Younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war'. Head of the investigation Suki Nagra said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group.' She added that ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority. She told Human Rights Watch: 'I saw in front of my eyes ISIS soldiers pulling hair, beating girls, and slamming the heads of anyone who resisted. 'They were like animals\u2026. Once they took the girls out, they would rape them and bring them back to exchange for new girls. The girls\u2019 ages ranged from eight to 30 years\u2026 only 20 girls remained in the end.' This comes just weeks after the release of 216 Yazidi prisoners who had been held captive since last summer when ISIS militants attacked their villages in the area around Sinjar in northwestern Iraq. The freed prisoners said that they had been led to believe they were being led to their execution, but instead, were piled onto a minibus that drove them to peshmerga positions. It was not clear why the radical jihadists had decided to release the Yazidis, whom they consider devil-worshippers, but the group previously freed 200 more it was holding under similarly mysterious circumstances. Yazidi activists say many remain in the hands of Islamic State, which has often subjected women to rape or sexual slavery. The United Nations said last month that the Islamic State may have committed genocide against the minority. The Yazidis are an ancient, predominantly Kurdish, people who follow their own religion derived from Islam, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.",

The U.N.-sponsored talks should resume \"but only after a complete halt of attacks,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in a Facebook post. The previous round of talks between Houthi rebels and the government of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi failed in January after rebels attacked the President's personal residence and presidential palace in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly monthlong air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni government military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, according to security sources in Taiz. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. Explosions lasted for about 40 minutes, they said. It was unclear whether it was a resumption of the operation or a short-term series of strikes. Meanwhile, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa on Wednesday, according to a senior Saudi source speaking on condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back \"security and stability through establishing a political process,\" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Hadi, who claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,\" said Hadi. In the country's south, security officials on Wednesday reported two U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants in Mukalla. Six suspected militants died in the attack. This is the second drone strike in three days. On Monday, six militants were killed when drone strikes targeted two vehicles in Shabwah, west of Mukalla. A U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday that the United States is conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last few days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Nic Robertson, Salim Essaid, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.",

This in an email conversation the director was having with former studio head Amy Pascal. Scroll down for video . In a leaked Sony email Cameron Crowe (above) mocks Bruce Jenner's gender transition . He makes a joking reference to Jenner's (above) transition while speaking with Amy Pascal (right) While discussing his upcoming film Aloha, which stars an all-star cast that includes Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, and Alec Baldwin, Pascal asked Crowe if he had anything to show her from the movie in October 2014. Crowe's response to this was; 'DOES BRUCE JENNER WANT BOOBS? HELL YES I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU!!!! (looking at tuesday).' It was revealed in previous leaked emails that Pascal is now fan of Crowe's upcoming film, writing in one email; 'I'm never starting a movie again when the script is ridiculous. I don't care how much I love the director and the actors. It never, not even once, ever works.' She also said of the movie;\u00a0'People don't like people in movies who flirt with married people or married people who flirt.' Crowe has yet to respond to this leaked email. This while the two are discussing Crowe's upcoming film Aloha (above), which stars Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper . Jenner meanwhile is set to discuss his transition in an upcoming inter with Diane Sawyer. This as it was revealed reported that only Khloe Kardashian initially supported him through his decision. 'Besides Khlo\u00e9, the Kardashians were not on board with his transition,' a source told US Weekly. 'His boys, Brody and Brandon stuck by him, but Bruce feels like Kris and her girls only support him publicly to make themselves look good.'",

Dr Seward told the Geelong Advertiser the investigation confirmed Mr Barr had not broken any law and 'at no point' did his actions affect the care provided to students.

A large crowd erupted in cheers as Pemba Tamang was carried out on a stretcher. He was wearing a New York shirt and a blue neck brace, was blanketed by dust and had the look of a deer in the headlights. His rescuer, Inspector Lakshman Basnet of the Nepalese Armed Police Force, said Tamang was responsive and showed no apparent signs of serious injury. He was given an IV drip and rushed from the Gongapur area to a temporary emergency hospital run by an Israeli aid team. The Nepalese rescuers had been working for five hours to locate Tamang after they heard his voice coming from under the debris. Also Thursday, a U.S. special operations forces team rescued 30 people, including three Americans, by helicopter from an area of Nepal called Bamboo Village, according to the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. The group was trapped in the village and living in a makeshift shelter, Ambassador Peter Bodde said. The families had contacted the U.S. government to let officials know where their relatives were stuck, he said. They had no other way to get out of the area, Bodde said. An American disaster response team was also involved in the rescue of the 15 year old boy. The team was at a nearby damaged bus station when it got word that someone might be alive. Andrew Olvera, the head of the U.S. team, said his men rushed over with search dogs and equipment ranging from breaching tools to sophisticated cameras that can probe under the rubble. He said the operation carried enormous risk, as chunks of the collapsed building hung precariously on rebar. Entire floors of what used to be people's homes were visible -- ceiling fans and beds still draped with cotton sheets. It was a mountain of loss and sorrow. \"It's dangerous, but it's what we do,\" said Olvera, who has a daughter and twin 11-year-old boys. \"It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we will risk almost everything. \"The way the building is, it's definitely a miracle,\" he said. Tamang cried for water in a muffled voice. He had been buried for five days under a building that pancaked. He dodged death because of a motorcycle that shielded him from the pressure of the concrete and steel, according to Basnet. And, Basnet said, he \"survived by good faith.\" Dennis Bautista, who went down to where Tamang was buried to administer medical aid, called the rescue amazing. \"It feels good to be able to help out. I can't imagine what he went through,\" Bautista said. \"He is a brave young man.\" Basnet said once he got closer to Tamang, he tried to reassure him that he would be OK. \"I gave him water and talked to him regularly,\" Basnet said. After Tamang was rushed to the hospital, the US Agency for International Development team continued the search. The possibility remained that someone else might have survived, like Tamang. Other search and rescue teams continued to scour through Kathmandu's rubble Thursday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities. Another 72 people were reported dead in India and 25 in China. In Nepal, 19 of the deaths occurred on Mount Everest, where the quake triggered deadly avalanches. Despite the disaster, Nepali authorities plans to reopen routes up the mountain as soon as next week. Teams are clearing paths and and rebuilding ladders, Tourism Ministry spokesman Krishna Sapkota told CNN on Thursday. Officials are encouraging people who have already received permission to climb this season to go ahead with their plans. As the chances dimmed for finding people alive in the wreckage left by the quake across Nepal, Tamang's rescue boosted hopes for all those who still have loved ones and friends missing. Other people have been saved from under collapsed buildings in previous days, including a 27-year-old man on Tuesday and a 4-month-old boy on Sunday. The Nepali military also released a photo of a dust-caked 11-year-old girl who they said was rescued Wednesday after 90 hours under the rubble. The rescuers, meanwhile, have no intention of giving up looking for more. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Olvera said, revised the benchmark for what was thought possible for survival. A man there was miraculously pulled from the rubble after 27 long days. 360-degree view of earthquake zone . CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)The United States has gained much from its position as a space-faring nation. Indeed, U.S. access to space has provided incredible benefit to U.S. national security, defense and the economic well-being of the nation. And in order to effectively confront current and future conflicts, combat terrorism and counter the proliferating threats worldwide, our military depends on space-based capabilities, including intelligence, GPS, and communications satellites. Unfortunately, as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates, the U.S. is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on Russian technology to meet our national security obligations. How? For a start, we depend on the Atlas V rocket, which carries many of our most important satellites and is powered by the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine. The fact that we rely on Russia, currently under sanctions for invading a sovereign nation, should reinforce the need for a change in our current course. Assured access to space is an area where the U.S. should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains, which are subject to disruption, threats, unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the U.S. The Ukraine crisis should have served as a wake-up call, highlighting the danger of dependence on Russia to launch national security satellites into space. And the United States should play no part in supporting the defense industry of a country that continues to abrogate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Simply put, it is bad policy to rely on others for critical national security requirements, and worse policy when this reliance supports countries taking action in direct contradiction to U.S. national security interests. Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defense and space industries, has called American taxpayer outlays for the Russian engine \"free money\" that goes directly back into Russia's missile modernization programs. It is high time the U.S. government turn to its existing domestic capability and turn off this flow of funds. Fortunately, there are some signs of progress. Last year, Congress took bipartisan action to phase out reliance on the RD-180 engine by the end of the decade, and to transition to an all-American space launch capability. The defense authorization for fiscal year 2015 included restrictions on the future use of the RD-180 for the Atlas V, authorizing $220 million to begin development of a U.S. alternative. This was a wise move, but it's not enough. There are steps that the United States can take now to ensure our access to space and secure our comparative advantage in space -- and in the world. True, development of a new launch system will take time; there are no overnight answers. However, a combination of existing capabilities and dynamic development of new capabilities by the private sector can serve as a foundation for eliminating any capability gap in the U.S. space program. Indeed, new entrants are coming online using launch vehicle systems fully designed and manufactured in America. The two main launch competitors -- United Launch Alliance and SpaceX -- each have all-American systems, namely ULA's Delta IV family of rockets and SpaceX's Falcon 9. Having both options will put America on the path to fielding its indigenous space capabilities for the next generation, while strengthening a space industrial base weakened since the end of the Cold War. The short-term goal should be to transition to existing American-manufactured launch vehicles, as opposed to phasing out systems such as the Delta IV, which continue to provide critical capability. In the long term, next-generation development programs should not involve major Russian subsystems and components. It is time to end America's reliance on Russia's rocket engine. This would be good for national security, good for American innovation and the industrial base -- and good for our country's future.",

Bournemouth were out of it. Then they were in it. Then it all went bonkers and Eddie Howe was caught between feelings of regret and unhappiness with Paul Tierney, the referee. The stripped-down fact is that it finished 2-2. The glorious detail is that Bournemouth trailed to a Kieran Lee sucker punch, levelled through Yann Kermorgant and then had a man sent off. A problem? Not really. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court .

Subs not used: Westwood, May, McCabe, Bus . Booked: Buxton, Helan, Isgrove . Referee:\u00a0Paul Tierney . Attendance:11,280 . Matt Ritchie scored the kind of goal that belongs in the Premier League to put them in front. Job done? Not nearly. Chris Maguire scored a penalty for Wednesday deep into stoppage time and three point became one; a big step towards the top flight became a stumble. Howe was left 'heartbroken', but also frustrated, not least because he felt Callum Wilson deserved a penalty in the second half when he appeared to be fouled by Lewis Buxton. Bournemouth have had 15 penalties this season and Howe suggested that might be counting against them, saying in a radio interview: 'It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said don\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\u2019 t want them to have any more.' His broader disappointment was also clear, having blown a major opportunity to keep top spot in a thrilling division. He said: 'It really is tough to take. That is why we love the game \u2013 the drama and twists and turns. 'The pain and frustration we need to transfer into motivation. This is our most successful season but we have had low moments. We have only two games and our objective is clear. We have to use this as motivation to move forward now. We have to respond.' Lee had put Wednesday in front with a 36th-minute header before Kermorgant levelled midway through the second half. A draw at that stage might have seemed fair but Simon Francis was sent off for two yellow cards and Bournemouth were back on the ropes. Cue bedlam. Ritchie launched a shot into the top corner after Andrew Surman laid off a free-kick but Maguire added to the madness in stoppage time. Wednesday manager Stuart Grey couldn't help but chuckle. He said: 'It took six and a half hours to get down here but we got on with it. If we left without anything it would have been disappointing.'

Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem \u2018irritating\u2019, \u2018annoying\u2019 and \u2018frustrating\u2019 and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad\u2019s Army and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC\u2019s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: \u2018Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? 'All because you can\u2019t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?\u2019 Another added: \u2018I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.\u2019 Shows such as Dad\u2019s Army and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes .

Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC\u2019s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: \u2018There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can\u2019t humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.\u2019",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Bernie Sanders, my Vermont senator and, indeed, a friend of many years, is now running for president.  He noted at his announcement (with a familiar note of wise irony):  \"People should not underestimate me.\" To most Americans, of course, Sen. Bernie Sanders is only a name, if that.  He is barely known to the general public, which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation. Those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left-wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the Senate, as we did in 2006.  Let me add this, as someone who has followed him closely (and with admiration) for a long time:  When people stop to listen to Bernie, they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is, without a question, an authentic voice who speaks without fear. And nobody should underestimate him. I remember when Bernie was mayor of Burlington; it is the largest city in Vermont (which isn't saying much).  I met him then, and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before.  He spoke with a throaty Brooklyn accent, and he was Jewish -- not your typical Vermonter. He served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of Lake Champlain with remarkable energy for many years, listening closely to what people had to say, learning about politics at the local level, making a real difference in the daily lives of hard-working people. He was never a Democrat -- and isn't yet.  He's a progressive, holding his seat in the U.S. Senate as an independent, although he votes with the Democrats on major issues. When Bernie decided to run for Jim Jeffords' seat in the House of Representatives in 1988, many considered him a long shot.  I remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse, where Bernie held the floor for almost two hours, answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce, funny, entertaining, passionate voice.  Bernie won that seat, again and again. Make no mistake about this:  Vermont isn't just a rainbow-colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets.  It's an agricultural economy, and Bernie has understood this well.  He has thoughtfully supported Vermont's dairy-farming community over many years.  He has also been a strong supporter of Vermont's hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left, who wonder why the NRA doesn't attack him. I was never prouder of Bernie than during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.  He was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the House, strongly opposing the 2003 invasion.  He saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in American history, one with endless repercussions. He was especially outraged by the outing of former CIA spy Valerie Plame in 2006 by an official from the Pentagon, and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the Iraq War in the first place. This was typical of Bernie: The clear voice in the midst of the crowd, the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly. So what would it look like if, by some bizarre chance, Bernie caught fire and became President? He would certainly work hard for universal health care, which has been a passion of his.  I've heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single-payer system -- that has worked well throughout Europe for decades, reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well. He would not be Wall Street's best friend.  Indeed, he didn't support President George W. Bush in his efforts to bail out the bankers, and wrote an open letter to Henry Paulson, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, protesting that bailout.  Famously, on December 10, 2010, he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate opposing the reinstatement of Bush-era tax cuts, a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand Bernie's views. He is a socialist, of course.  How many American politicians have ever said this aloud?   And what does he really mean by that term? Bernie knows what he's doing.  By proclaiming himself a socialist, he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks, many with international bases, have controlled American public policy for a very long time, usually to the detriment of working people. And it's working people who seem mostly to interest Bernie Sanders.  He has been one of only a few voices in the Senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right-wing factions funded by \"millionaires and billionaires\" (one of Bernie's favorite mantras) have held sway over American politics for as long as anyone can recall. And this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads, serve meals, deliver the mail, drive trucks and teach in schools. As president, Bernie would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change.   Indeed, Bernie co-sponsored with Barbara Boxer the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007.   He has, for years, been a tireless advocate for the environment, aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad. But does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the Democratic nomination?  And if he won it, could he defeat a Republican candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal? He's not crazy.  In fact, he's probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes.  But he can't win, and he knows that.  What he will do, however, is move Hillary Clinton on matters of importance to progressives: The restraining of Wall Street and large corporations, the scandal of how America allows its political campaigns to be funded  and the welfare of working class Americans, who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests. A steep climb looms before him.  But I applaud Bernie Sanders.  I hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard.",

Nursing student Anthony Clark Reed (left and right) was driving around Detroit, Michigan, on Monday night when he was pulled over. He suffered a heart attack during a traffic stop after complaining he had trouble breathing . His father, pastor Kevin Clark, claimed his son had been 'driving erratically' because he was having trouble breathing and was searching for his inhaler. He told The Huffington Post\u00a0that he suffered an asthma attack, and the police were indirectly responsible for his death. 'He was gasping for air, looking for his inhaler [as he was driving],' Clark told the site. 'When Detroit police pulled him out of the car he was already in panic mode \u2026 and they handcuffed him, and he's trying to tell them he can't breathe. 'I believe it caused his death ... He dropped dead right there, in the hands of Detroit police officers who were negligent.' He described how he found out about his son's death two hours after the incident.

Spokeswoman June West said: 'We provided him with answers as best we could at this stage of the investigation and we will be reaching out to the family in the next few days to provide them with updated information as it becomes available.' Jennifer Moreno from the Detroit Police media relations department told\u00a0MILive: 'Officers did stop the gentleman for a traffic violation and subsequently he exited the vehicle ... had an asthma attack. 'They gave him his inhaler (and) they administered CPR when the gentleman passed out and then (an ambulance) was ordered ...' The coroner's office have yet to determine the cause of death. Pastor Clark (pictured with Anthony Clark Reed's twin sisters) claimed there wasn't anyone from Detroit Police at the hospital when he arrived to identify his son's body .",

Jamal Kiyemba, 36, was detained in the Ugandan capital Kampala in connection with the death of Joan Kagezi, who was killed in front of her children days before a major trial against Islamist terror network Al-Shabaab. Kiyemba, a former pharmacy student at a university in Leicester, who grew up in London, was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years and awarded the huge payout after being released. Arrested: Ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner Jamal Kiyemba, 36 was detained in\u00a0Kampala over the brutal murder of top female prosecutor Joan Kagezi . The 36-year-old is one of 16 former Guantanamo prisoners awarded a \u00a320million payout from the British taxpayer over claims of false imprisonment and human rights abuse. His case was championed by Muslim human rights group CAGE, whose director infamously branded ISIS executioner Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi an 'extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was born in Uganda as Anthony Kiyemba, but converted to Islam aged 20, changing his name to Jamal Abdullah. When the family arrived in Britain following the death of his father in 1993, Kiyemba, then 14, was granted indefinite leave to remain, but never applied for British citizenship. Kiyemba was arrested near Peshawar in Pakistan in March 2002, after allegedly trying to enter Afghanistan in the company of 'a probable al-Qaeda operative, a suspected al-Qaeda operative and a low-level jihadist', U.S. military files reveal. Compensated: Kiyemba was awarded \u00a31million from the British government over claims he had been tortured by U.S. intelligence and interrogated by the MI5 at Guantanamo which had violated his human rights . Kiyemba, however, claims he had gone to Pakistan to study Arabic and the Koran because the country was 'very cheap'. Following his 2006 release, he claimed he had only admitted to terrorist activities under torture by American intelligence officers and that he had been interrogated by MI5. He was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years but as he was not a British citizen, he was not entitled to representation by the Foreign Office nor, on his release, to automatic rights to return to his family. Kiyemba, whose mother, four brothers and sister all live in Britain, was instead deported to Uganda, but made several attempts to be allowed back into the UK. 'I may not be British according to some bit of paper but in reality I am a Brit and always will be,' he said in an interview following his release. 'My doctor, my local mosque, my teens, my education, employment, friends, taxes, home and above all else my family - it is all in Britain.' Support: Kiyemba's compensation claims were championed by human rights charity CAGE, whose research director, Asim Qureshi, pictured, famously branded ISIS executioner Jihadi John a 'kind, beautiful' man . Kiyemba was arrested alongside three others in a suburb to Kampala on Tuesday as a result of an operation aided by U.S. officials, Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said. Jamal Kyiemba is one of 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees paid compensation by the British Government over claims of human rights abuse. A total of \u00a320million has been awarded to former prisoners in an out-of-court settlement after they made allegations against British intelligence, the Sun reports. Others include Shaker Aamer, 48, who still remains in Guantanamo after 13 years without charge or trial, despite being cleared for release twice. Once he is released Mr Aamer, from south London, should be entitled to \u00a31million. Ms Kagezi had been a prosecutor in the ongoing trial of 12 suspects accused of being involved in the July 2010 bombings in which 76 people were killed while watching the World Cup final on TV. Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab, who were behind the brutal massacre of nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university this month, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this year, Ms Kagezi had been appointed Head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. Kagezi was shot twice by gunmen after she left her car \u2014 in which she was traveling with two of her children on the way home from work \u2014 to buy groceries in a Kampala suburb. After shooting her in the head and neck, the gunmen fled on a motorcycle, according to police. Ugandan police say there is not yet conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the murder of Ms Kagezi, but that detectives were questioning him about any possible role and about other offenses. Kiyemba has yet to comment on the allegations. Ugandan police on Tuesday arrested at least six suspects.",

Tanguy Pepiot, a steeplechase runner for the University of Oregon, had a clear lead on his rival Meron Simon, who competes for the University of Washington. But at a track meet Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, a crowd of more than 3,000 people saw the distance evaporate after Pepiot raised his hands in pre-emptive joy, with less than 100m to go. Tanguy\u00a0Pepiot\u00a0celebrated his victory (left) before missing out to his rival on the finishing line (right) Pepiot (right)\u00a0is pictured raising his hands to excite the crowd - as Meron Simon (left) tears toward him . The gesture seemed to sap some of his momentum, opening the way for Simon to speed towards the finish line, and beat him by a tenth of a second. The home crowd roared as Simon powered ahead - seemingly in an attempt to warn French-born Pepiot. But the warning came too late, and Simon flashed past, leaving Pepiot, who is in his senior year, to collapse, defeated. Simon's time, 8:57.86, exceeded his personal record by around 15 seconds. Speaking to the Eugene Register-Guard\u00a0after the contest, a newly-victorious Simon said: 'I thought he had me. Simon edges past Meriot as the pair approach the line, eventually beating him by a tenth of a second . After celebrating his triumph, Simon headed back to help\u00a0Pepiot up after he collapsed to the ground in defeat . 'I thought he was just so far ahead. Then I heard the crowd get crazy, and he started throwing his hands up. 'I was like, \"I don\u2019t think he knows I\u2019m coming\". I just went to the line and just raced.' After a justified victory celebration of his own, Simon doubled back to console his close rival. Not long after, a defeated Pepiot told columnist Austin Meek: 'I think it was the first time it happened to me. I'll make sure it's the last time.' Meron (left) ran his best ever\u00a0time in the 3,000m steeplechase, while\u00a0Pepiot\u00a0has pledged not to get cocky again .",

Marilyn Zuniga sparked outrage for allowing her third grade class in Orange, New Jersey, to pen letters to murderer\u00a0Mumia Abu-Jamal, after he collapsed in the bathroom of the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy. Abu-Jamal, 60, is serving a life sentence in prison after he shot Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in cold blood in 1981. Marilyn Zuniga apologised after she allowed her students to write to convicted police killer Mumia Abu-Jamal after he became ill while serving a life sentence in prison, but said the students wanted to write to him . Ms Zuniga has apologised for publicising the efforts of her pupils online, but said they had wanted to write to Abu-Jamal, according to\u00a0philly.com. Both her pupils and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union wrote to the killer. Ms Zuniga spoke at the Orange school board after she was suspended from her position while officials investigate. She explained that she had previously asked her class to consider Abu-Jamal's quote 'So long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.' She said when she told students the former Black Panther was ill, they had asked to write to him in prison. Ms Zuniga told the board she had made a mistake and was prepared to resign rather than be fired, to prevent damage to her career. Mumia's supporters say photos of the killer eleased this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is . Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . The letters caused many to criticize the actions of the teacher. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. He previously told Fox News: 'I think its both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Abu Jamal was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Mr Faulkner in the back and then, once he was dead, in between the eyes. Abu-Jamal shot dead Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, shooting him at first in the back . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death for the killing, but this was overturned in 2012. The official reason the convicted killer was hospitalized has not been released. However reports say he was suffering high blood sugar levels which may be linked to diabetes. The killer's supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Johanna Fernandez, a professor of history at Baruch College who delivered the letters said they had made Abu-Jamal 'smile' and 'chuckle.'",

Christopher Scarver, who was sentenced to two life terms in prison for killing Dahmer and another man at Columbia Correctional Institution in 1994, said the confessed cannibal would leave the fake limbs around the prison where others would find them. \"He crossed the line with some people -- prisoners, prison staff,\" the newspaper quoted Scarver as saying. \"Some people who are in prison are repentant -- but he was not one of them.\" In a separate story, the Post quotes Dahmer's former prison minister as saying the convict would make jokes about this cannibalistic past. \"If he saw a guard that was nervous and standing near enough to hear him, he would say, 'I bite,'\" the newspaper quoted the pastor, Roy Ratcliff, as saying. \"Usually the guard would jump away and that would make Jeff laugh.\" \"He sort of played with his persona to exaggerate it and make people more fearful,\" Ratcliff said. \"This was just his way \u2014 a morbid humor to deal with his hopeless situation.\" Scarver was convicted of killing Dahmer on November 28, 1994. He told the Post that he killed Dahmer and another inmate, Jesse Anderson, after an altercation while they were together unsupervised on a work detail. Scarver said he kept a newspaper article detailing Dahmer's crimes, which included killing 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991, having sex with corpses, keeping some of the body parts and eating others. Just before he killed Dahmer, Scarver said, he confronted him with the clipping. \"I asked him if he did those things 'cause I was fiercely disgusted. He was shocked. Yes, he was,\" the Post quoted Scarver as saying. Scarver said he hit Dahmer twice in the head with a metal bar from a weight room. He then killed Anderson, who was working in a different room.",

Los Angeles judge Richard Fruin Jr. awarded Shelly Sterling most of the nearly $3million she had sought. Lawyers for Sterling had claimed that money used to buy V. Stiviano a house, luxury cars and stocks was her community property the couple had acquired over six decades of marriage. Stiviano's lawyer had argued that the gifts were made when Donald and Shelly were separated and that Shelly Sterling couldn't seek them from a third party. Scroll down for video . Shelly Sterling has been awarded nearly all of the $3 million she had sought to be returned from V. Stiviano, who had argued that the gifts were made when Donald Sterling was separated from his wife . Tuesday's ruling comes nearly a year after Stiviano's recording of Donald Sterling making racially offensive remarks bounced him from the NBA and cost him team ownership. Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings to show he bought Stiviano a house, a Ferrari and other things. In the recordings on Stiviano's iPhone, she and the 80-year-old billionaire are heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the entire house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Donald Sterling had given Stiviano a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex . Donald Sterling said Stiviano hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the house and, noting that Stiviano is part black and Hispanic, said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending Hispanic bank and escrow employees. Shelly Sterling filed the suit against Stiviano about a month before the recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. In closing arguments, late last month, Shelly Sterling's lawyer had relied on the words of Miss Stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy. Testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court wasn't as clear-cut even after Sterling's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks Donald Sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of Stiviano's $1.8 million Spanish-style duplex near Beverly Hills. While an accountant for Sterling conservatively estimated that Stiviano got more than $3.6 million in Sterling gifts that included a Ferrari and Paris shopping spree, O'Donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $1 million in cash, saying the lower figure lined up with Stiviano's own admissions on the witness stand, depositions and court filings. V. Stiviano, 32, pictured arriving at Los Angeles Superior court last month, painted two conflicting portraits of Donald Sterling, saying he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but also a 'bigot' who was mean to others . Judge Richard Fruin Jr had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts. Defense lawyer Mac Nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument. He attacked the credibility of witnesses, particularly Donald Sterling, who had suggested Stiviano got her name on the home title illegally. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. Nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law doesn't allow Shelly Sterling to go after a third party like Stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband. 'Say he gave $2,000 to a call girl,' Nehoray said. 'Mrs. Sterling can't go and try to get that money back. We know that's not how it works.' In her testimony, Stiviano testified that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children. 'We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,' she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature. Shelly Sterling, who accused Stiviano of fraud when she testified, painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and was now out to hurt him. Wife speaks:\u00a0Shelly Sterling, estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers basketball team owner Donald Sterling, and her attorney Pierce O'Donnell arrive at Los Angeles Superior Court last month. Mrs Sterling\u00a0painted Stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts . Stiviano, seen here outside the court during last month's trial, testified that tolerating Sterling's racist moments was 'part of the job' Platonic relationship: The 32-year-old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the Clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature . Stiviano never not disputed Donald Sterling's largesse, though she quibbled with the sums at stake and emphatically denied that she used sex to manipulate him. She repeatedly testified that Sterling tried to manipulate her. The apparent contradictions finally led Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, to confront Stiviano with the question: 'Who is the real Donald Sterling?' 'The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,' Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was 'kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.' She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family. Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. In her testimony, Miss Stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor, and she named a male friend of Sterling's who accompanied them on trips to Dubai, Paris and Thailand. Shelly Sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy, and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises Stiviano. The judge allowed the testimony as Stiviano's lawyer tried to show where large, unexplained checks may have gone from Sterling's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $1.8million duplex, luxury cars, jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman Shelly Sterling asserts was his mistress. Stiviano said she saw cashier's checks given to the man for $800,000 for a 'so-called business deal' involving a property in Los Angeles and a check for $75,000 to reimburse him for the Dubai travel. Stiviano couldn't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase. She has denied that those were her bank accounts, and Sterling's lawyers couldn't make that connection. The 32-year-old witness said she had worked for Sterling's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years, driving him to view real estate or attending Clippers meetings and games together. She said he provided money, but it was not regular income \u2014 and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job. 'As long as you're with me side by side, I will take care of everything you need,' she said he assured her. But Stiviano became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement. She said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork. 'I know how he works his trickery,' she said. 'I knew something wasn't right.'",

Brave Finley Lamb suffers from rare brain abnormality Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia - which means many of his 'grey matter' cells have not migrated to the correct position. It left the boy, from Wallasey, Merseyside, unable to walk and talk, and with a 90 per cent chance of developing Epilepsy. Finley Lamb, five, pictured with his dad Dan and mother Sara, suffers from a rare brain abnormality . He is also highly likely to suffer heart, lung and bowel problems. But the five-year-old amazed mother Sara when he took his first steps last year and has continued to defy the odds by starting primary school - and he even makes the journey on foot. 'It was around May last year when Finley just got up on his own and walked across the room - we were amazed,' said the mother-of-two, 37. 'It just seemed to click with him and ever since then he has been building up from 50 metres a day, now to two or three miles five days a week. 'His programme says he has to do at least two miles a day and he can even get up curbs now on his own and walk up steps with a rail which is amazing. 'When Finley was diagnosed with PVNH we were told he would probably never walk or talk - but now he is in mainstream school and playing with the other kids and his little brother. 'We just can't believe his progress. We never thought he would be able to lead an independent life, but now there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to. We are so pleased.' Finley defied the odds to take his first steps last year and now enjoys walking the two miles to school . Finley made huge progress after he started a programme designed specifically for him by the Family Hope Center, based in Philadelphia, USA, just two years ago in April 2013. The centre treats children with special needs and developmental delays and suggested special exercises and lifestyle changes intended to stimulate Finley's brain. Finley was diagnosed with PVNH when he was two years old, which affects around just 50 children in the UK. But the determined schoolboy has made huge developments - with his brain function going from 54 per cent to 76 per cent and his mobility increasing from that of a seven-week-old baby to a two-year-old toddler. And he now attends St Peter and St Paul Primary on the Wirral, Merseyside. Sara - who also has a three-year-old son Noah with husband Dan - said: 'Finley has made so much progress and that is why I am so passionate about getting this message out. 'It is hard to think what he would be like had we not found the Family Hope Center and he still wasn't able to walk or talk. And he was under a lot of emotional stress. 'At three-and-a-half he wasn't walking or crawling, he slept in a cot like a baby and couldn't speak at all. 'Now he doesn't stop talking. I nearly crashed the car one day because he said his first sentence and said 'Mummy I don't want to go there'. I thought there must have been someone else in the car. Finley's mother Sarah, pictured with him left, said: 'We never thought he would be able to lead an independent life, but now there is no reason why he shouldn't be able to' 'I think sometimes there is a misconception that disabled children don't realise what they are missing, but it was shocking for us to find out just how much Finley actually does understand. It is a neurological disorder caused by clumps of grey\u00a0that did not move to the correct location in the brain during early development. PVNH can cause seizures, breathing problems, joint problems, intellectual delays and other concern. It affects just 50 children in the UK. Little is known about the long term outcome of patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia . 'He is very determined to do things now and he questions things when he cant do them. 'His behaviour has changed so much and I didn't think that was possible. 'He is so much more confident and independent, and just like a normal child now. It is amazing - he won't let me do anything for him now. 'It has been hard work for us, but if it is working you don't care how much effort or time it takes. I think he will have another year or two left on the programme then he should be finished.' Finley is due to have his fifth appointment with the Family Hope Center in Liverpool next week - and has visited the center in Philadelphia three times.",

Mohammed Abu Khdeir's name appeared this week on the wall at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl, the site of the national cemetery, as the nation prepared to mark its Memorial Day on Wednesday. Abu Khdeir, 16, was beaten and burned alive by three Israelis in July, according to prosecutors. A picture on the memorial website for Abu Khdeir shows an Israeli flag with two flowers called \"Blood of the Maccabees\" in Israel, a symbol often used on Memorial Day, when the country honors its soldiers killed in the line of duty and victims of terrorism. But Abu Khdeir's family objected to his inclusion on the memorial wall. His father, Hussein Abu Khdeir, said no one asked for his permission to put his son's name on the wall. \"I refuse that my son's name will be listed between soldiers of the occupation,\" he said. Almagor, an organization that works on behalf of victims of terror in Israel, also opposes Abu Khdeir's inclusion on the memorial. Almagor described the teen's death as a rogue attack and said he's not a terror victim. \"Somebody did here a trick, and we are going to fight to correct it,\" said Almagor CEO Meir Indor.  \"We will not recognize someone who was murdered in a brutal way in an individual action.\" Indor's organization wrote a letter to the National Insurance Institute of Israel -- the country's social security administration, which maintains the memorial site -- demanding that Abu Khdeir's name be removed from the memorial wall. Indor said if the teenager's name is not taken off, members of Almagor want their own family members' names removed. On Wednesday, Israel Radio reported that the National Insurance Institute of Israel will remove Abu Khdeir's name from the memorial following his father's complaints.  The teen's name has already been removed from the organization's website, which lists the names on the memorial wall. A panel of judges began hearing evidence in January against the three suspects in Abu Khdeir's killing.",

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'",

Five hundred years later, just one of the Inca rope bridges remains: the Keshwa Chaca, which\u00a0spans the Apurimac River near Huinchiri, Peru, in the Province of Canas. Dangerous work: Local villagers work on renewing the Keshwa Chaca - the last Inca rope bridge - in the Andes near Huinchiri, Peru . Incredible skill: The 90ft long Keshwa Chaca remains thanks to local villagers who rebuild the bridge each year using the same techniques as their Inca ancestors . As they expanded their empire, the Incas built an entire network of bridges to move armies, people and goods quickly and efficiently over the mountains. Even though it would take another 300 years before suspension bridges came to Europe, it is estimated that the Inca kingdom was connected by some 200, all made by hand. The bridges were an integral part of the incredible Inca road system that stretches for 25,000 miles, from modern-day Ecuador to Argentina. The last Incas disappeared in the early 17th century, and over the years their bridges followed. The Keshwa Chaca remains thanks to local villagers who rebuild the bridge each year using the same techniques as their Inca ancestors. Craft: The ropes for the bridge are made from the 'ichu' grass, which is braided by the local villagers . Safe walk: Although the Keshwa Chaca bridge may look frail, it has been proven to support the weight of 56 people standing across the walkway . Ready to go: As the last Inca bridge, Keshwa Chaca has become a tourist attraction, with visitors paying a small fee to walk across the gorge . Ancient tradition: It takes three days to rebuild the Keshwa Chaca, which is done in June every year . It spans 90ft over the Apurimac River some 100ft below, and villagers claim it has been there for 500 years. In the Inca days, local villagers would rebuild the Keshwa Chaca\u00a0each year as a way of paying tax, but in modern times residents of the region keep the ancient tradition and skills alive by renewing the bridge every June. After the bridge has been built, it is left to disintegrate before being constructed again the next year. The raw material is 'ichu', a type of grass common on the sparse mountainsides of the Andes, which is braided into rope for the bridge. Each household in the four nearby villages is responsible for bringing 90 feet of braided grass rope, Slate reports. The bridge consists of five parallel 'ichu' ropes, which are braided to be about four inches thick, fastened at stone platforms on each side of the gorge. The floor or walkway is of small sticks and canes, fastened transversely with raw-hide strings, and two thick ropes are tied between the platforms as armrails. It takes three days to renew the Keshwa Chaca, and although it may look brittle, it has been proven to support the weight of 56 people standing across the walkway.",

A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.",

The Portuguese manager, 52, is leading the Blues towards their fourth Barclays Premier League title in his second stint at Stamford Bridge - two championships arrived during his original tenure. Retired right-back Ferreira, who followed Mourinho from Porto in 2004 before spending nine years in west London, believes his countryman's desire to succeed with Chelsea knows no bounds. Jose Mourinho is on the cusp of winning his third Premier League title during two spells with Chelsea . Former defender Paulo\u00a0Ferreira expects Mourinho to stay at Chelsea for a long, long time . He said: 'When you are at this club you want to win titles and for next season it will be the same. The motivation is to win trophies. 'He wants to succeed and do well, for how long I do not know. I think everyone at the club wants him to stay for a long, long time. 'I think everyone would like to see him in control for many years but in football, anything can happen.' While Mourinho remains the toast of SW6 and still has two years on his latest Chelsea contract, another recently returned club favourite could be on his way out this summer. Didier Drogba has scored only three league goals since rejoining on a one-year contract last July, but Ferreira hopes the Ivorian striker, now 37, gets to experience a 10th season with the Blues. Former Portugal international\u00a0Ferreira would also like to see Didier Drogba extend his stay at Stamford Bridge . Speaking on behalf of club sponsors Gazprom, Ferreira added: 'I would love to see him stay for another season but I don't know what he wants or what the club wants from him. 'Let's see what happens at the end of the season. 'He has the motivation to keep winning and keep playing and I want to hear what happens at the end of the season.' Ferreira played for Chelsea for nine years after following Mourinho from Porto in 2004 . Ferreira has been kept busy representing Chelsea as their European youth league ambassador but is also taking his coaching badges. The 36-year-old has not ruled out pursuing a role within the Blues' training set-up at Cobham. He added: 'I've just finished my (UEFA) B licence so I need two more years to finish, I hope. 'At the moment I'm just concentrating on finishing and then let's see what happens. It's just important to have it and then, who knows?' Paulo Ferreira was speaking on behalf of Gazprom, the energy behind Chelsea FC and a funding partner of the Chelsea Foundation Pimlico Premier League Kicks programme.",

Janet Brown was found naked, gagged with packing tape with her arms cuffed behind her back at the foot of the stairs of her family home in Radnage, near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire. Mrs Brown's two daughters Roxanne, 38, and Zara, 43, described their hother as a 'kind and loving nurse' claiming the horror of the crime 'stays with us every day. Janet Brown, pictured, was murdered at her family home 20 years ago by an unknown assailant . Builders found Mrs Brown's naked body dumped at the bottom of the stairs of her home, pictured . The killer handcuffed Mrs Brown's hands behind her back hand gagged her with packing tape . Mrs Brown's body was found on April 10, 1995. According to the Brown sisters: 'She was attacked and killed in our family home - a place where we should all be safe.' They said they believed that their mother's murder had been pre-planned. On the night she was killed, Mrs Brown was home alone. Her two daughters and her son Benedict, then 21, had gone out. The following day, the 51-year-old nurse's naked body was found at the foot of the stairs by builders who had turned up to do work on the detached house in Sprigs Holly Lane, Radnage near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire. A post mortem revealed she died of head injuries, which detectives believe were probably inflicted by a blunt instrument like a crowbar. The motive remains unclear with police describing the circumstances of the crime as 'unusual', adding they 'keeping an open mind'. One possible line of inquiry was that it had been a break-in gone wrong, but while a window was broken and the burglar alarm triggered, nothing was taken from the home. There was also no evidence Mrs Brown had been sexually assaulted. Peter Beirne, right, of the cold case squad and Mrs Brown's daughters Roxanne, centre and Zara, right, appealed for information about the 'heinous' crime revealing forensics experts now had the suspect's DNA . There was no evidence of a sexual assault at the crime scene in Radnage in Buckinghamshire, pictured . Members of Mrs Brown's family, pictured, made a similar appeal 20 years ago following her brutal murder . Detectives said that whomever the attacker was had brought the hand-cuffs and tape used to restrain Mrs Brown along with them. Despite what police called a 'thorough and professional investigation' at the time the killer has eluded capture, leaving her broken-hearted family without justice. In a bid to finally find the culprit, detectives turned to modern scientific techniques to analyse clues found at the time. Peter Beirne, the head of Thames Valley Police's major crime investigation review team, revealed a DNA sample belonging to an unknown person had now been successfully extracted. 'These new tests have produced a DNA sample,' he said. 'It does not belong to the family and we believe it could be a vital piece of evidence linking the killer to the scene.' He would not reveal what item the DNA sample was taken from. Police say there are plans to swab a number of people who featured in the original investigation, but stress there were 'no suspects, as such' - there have never been any arrests over the case. Instead, Mr Beirne said he was first appealing to the public to put forward names of anyone they believe may have been involved, who would then be tested. It would then be 'a simple task to either eliminate or implicate people as the source of the DNA', he added. Mr Beirne, a retired veteran police officer with more than 30 years experience as a detective, said if nothing useful comes to light then investigators may then look at 'a potential mass screening' in the area. He said: 'Janet's death left three children without a mother. 'We want to bring justice to Janet's family. 'If people have suspicions, I would urge them to contact police.' Mr Beirne added: 'Somebody out there knows who killed Janet - we're asking them to make contact.' Also appealing to the public, Roxanne Brown said: 'We need your help to find them.' It was revealed had she survived, Mrs Brown would now be a grandmother with detectives saying the youngsters had been robbed of the chance to know her. A \u00a320,000 reward is being offered for information leading to a successful conviction of the killer. Anyone who believes they may have any information about the crime is urged to call the police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Cold case detectives have relaunched a murder inquiry 25 years after a man was reported missing by his girlfriend. Andrew Bedford was 27-years-old when he disappeared in 1990. He was last seen eating a takeaway, possibly fish and chips, in a car in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire. The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit has today issued a fresh appeal for information on what would have been his 52nd birthday. Andrew Bedford was 27 when he went missing from a takeaway in Ramsay, Cambridgeshire in 1990 . Officers say that given the circumstances surrounding his disappearance and the amount of time that has passed, they are now confident he was murdered. They believe he was killed on September 28 with a shotgun at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists, in the market town. Detective Inspector Ian Simmons said: 'A team of detectives from the three force Major Investigations Unit is devoted to the cold case and we want to speak to anyone who has any information about Mr Bedford's disappearance and death. 'We would particularly like to speak to people who came forward before but maybe did not tell us everything they knew. 'No unsolved crime is ever closed. Where there is an opportunity to bring those who have escaped justice to account we will. 'We are in contact with Mr Bedford's family and keeping them fully informed of developments.' Mr Bedford, then of Tweet Street, Huntingdon, was last seen in a light blue Ford Cortina at 6.20pm on September 28 1990 in Factory Bank, Ramsey. He was reported missing the next day. He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers and was described as 5ft 8ins, of medium build, with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and various tattoos. Despite a huge police inquiry, which included extensive searches by helicopter and specialist divers, a nationwide poster campaign and a reconstruction on Crimestoppers, no trace of Mr Bedford was found. Three people were arrested but released without charge. The prime suspect for the shooting is now dead but others who were involved have never been brought to justice, the force said. Anyone with information should contact the Major Crime Unit on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.",

And former Arsenal and England striker Wright took to Twitter to praise him, saying: 'Congrats to Chelsea winning UEFA youth league. Jay da silva left back better player than any current prem left back.' Jay Dasilva has been praised by Ian Wright following his performances in the UEFA Youth League . Dasilva is better than any current Premier League left-back, according to Wright . Wright has predicted that four of the Chelsea side are set for a bright future in the game . In a later tweet, Wright also tipped Dasilva's team-mates Tammy Abraham, Charly Musonda and Charlie Colkett to enjoy bright futures in the game. Chelsea became the first English team to win the Youth League after two goals from captain Izzy Brown and another from Dominic Solanke led them to a 3-2 win. Dasilva, who hails from Luton and was signed by Chelsea aged 12, is an attack-minded left back who can also operate as a winger. Despite a slight build, he is able to make his presence felt and is quick going forward in possession of the ball and when tracking back.

Dominic Solanke celebrates after scoring Chelsea's second goal against Shakhtar Donetsk . He progressed quickly from the Under 15 team to the Under 18 side last season and helped Chelsea to their FA Youth Cup win over Fulham. He scored in the first leg at Craven Cottage. This season has seen further progress, with Dasilva making eight appearances in the Under 21 Premier League and nine in the Youth League run. He recently helped England's Under 17 team to this summer's European Championship finals and is set to feature in the tournament in Bulgaria next month. Abraham, the 17-year-old forward, has enjoyed a prolific season for the Chelsea Under 18 side, scoring 24 times in the league at that age group and adding four more in the Youth League. His six goals have helped Chelsea to a fifth FA Youth Cup final in six seasons - they will play Manchester City in the final, with the first leg scheduled for Monday.

He scored in last season's Under 21 Premier League final with Manchester United at Old Trafford and contributed a crucial late goal in the first leg of the Youth Cup final with Fulham. Colkett, 18, is a central midfielder who played a part in each game during Chelsea's Youth League run and has also played for the Under 21s.

The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time \u2013 just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department \u2013 his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don\u2019t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it\u2019s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He\u2019s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he\u2019s dealt with Van Gaal\u2019s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I\u2019ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019s a winner and a leader \u2013 perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view \u2013 Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can\u2019t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney\u2019s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate \u2013 for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season \u2013 he\u2019s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble \u2013 European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that\u2019s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV\u2019s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It\u2019s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?",

A third person suddenly starting shooting at the animal, but stray bullets hit Danel in the stomach and the second pedestrian in the buttocks, it was claimed.

Deputies from Jefferson Country sheriff's office quickly arrived at the scene - just after 1pm yesterday - to find Danel in agony. The bullet had narrowly missed his liver and he was rushed to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery to save his life. Tom Henderson, Centre Point's mayor, said the unknown gunman had been attempting to shoot the aggressive dog, but his bullets instead hit Danel and the second man. He told AL.com: 'There shouldn't be any guns being shot in that incident.' Mary Brooks, Danel's great aunt, said she rushed home from work when she was told about the shooting. 'I can't even tell you what went through my mind,' she said. 'I prayed all the way that he'd be alright. And that's all that matters.' Trayvon Smith, the dog's owner and a neighbour of Danel's family, denied accusations he had been the one shooting. He told WTVM that he had no guns, adding that he was very sorry for the boy. 'Everybody pray for that little boy, he needs as much prayers as he can get.' Police are continuing to look for the person who fired the shots, and anyone with information about the incident can contact the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office at 205-325-1450.

The 27-year-old Scot has lost his last seven matches to the Serb, this one the Miami Open final 7-6 4-6 6-0 on a brutally punishing afternoon, suffering the undeserving ignominy of conceding another love set against his old rival. He pushed him hard and had enough early chances to have won it in straight sets. In fact Murray pushed Djokovic so hard that, at the end of the second set, the furious Serb wrenched his towel off a startled ballkid and screamed at his box on his way to the chair, gaining a warning as his mask of statesmanship slipped.

Murray has had a good enough week to walk down the aisle with Kim Sears having got back to world No 3, but it is now ten out of eleven defeats against the world No 1. How to seize the moment against this phenomenal competitor is a hugely pressing issue for him and everyone else. As for Djokovic, he will now be holding that distinction for the 141st week of his career on Monday, putting him on sixth equal in the all-time list with Rafael Nadal. In some ways this was a truncated version of their Australian Open final. A forlorn Murray reflected afterwards: 'Game wise, I feel like in the couple of the matches we played this year I've been able to hang with him, but just not quite for long enough unfortunately.

I played well for two sets and was struggling physically in the third. I don't feel like I can do loads more than what I'm doing to get myself in the best condition possible, I do push myself very hard.' The first set was notable for Murray's early aggression that brought him a break in the third game and should have seen him open up a 3-1 lead. But it transpired that it was desperately difficult playing into the fierce lunchtime sun. Nobody actually held at the city end of the court until the eleventh game when the Serb managed it. Murray forced the tiebreak but, beginning on the more difficult side, could not recover from 0-4 down as he hit several forehands long. Djokovic dives desperately at the net as the first set goes the distance in the blazing heat . Murray shows his frustration as his two breaks in the first set are immediately countered by the Serbian . Both stars struggled serving into the sun with all four breaks in the first set coming from the same end . Djokovic had been starting to blow hard \u2013 rather like he did in Australia \u2013 and just like in Melbourne it all proved to be irrelevant as he took it 7-3. Gauging how the 27 year-old Serb is feeling is an extremely inexact science, and you could only speculate as a brutally punishing second set unfolded in more level fashion than the break-filled opener. Murray became more and more agitated as he failed to gain the breakthrough but held on until 5-4 when Djokovic dissolved into a ball of Balkan anger. Murray broke him to love and the Serb angrily snatched his towel off the ballboy, apologising later: ' I'm sorry, because I didn't pay attention to the ball boy and I just screamed at my box,' he said.

Murray had to hold at the start of the decider to set him on his way to what would have been a massive victory in the context of his season, the first time he had won a Masters level event since his Wimbledon triumph of 2013. The first three games of the decider were long and hard before \u2013 helped by some wonky Murray overheads \u2013 Djokovic just cracked his opponent's body and spirit.",

The vodka-fuelled duo doused all five bodies in petrol and set them alight at a flat in south-west Russia, according to prosecutors. Scroll down for video . Accused of murder and rape:\u00a0Sergey Burkaev, 16 (left) and Konstantin Surkov, 17, could be jailed for life . Slain at a party: Russian police released pixellated images of some of the victims, who were aged 16 to 22 . The baby-faced pair apparently fled in a stolen car but were arrested by traffic officers, who saw the vehicle being driven erratically. If convicted, Surkov and Burkaev face life in jail. The police who quizzed them say both teenagers have confessed to the murders and rape. The only reason they have given for the carnage was that they were drunk, the officers added. The horrific crimes reportedly took place at a house party in the small town of Kumertau in Bashkortostan on Friday night. A friend of party-goers - 17-year-old Svetlana Frolova - said: 'I just can't believe this has happened. They were all so friendly with each other and always hanging out together. 'I had been invited (to the party) too, and had really wanted to go, but my mum said I had to stay in to do my homework. I'm so glad I did. I can't understand why they did this.' Arrested: One of the youths is told to lean face down on a police car after being stopped in a 'stolen' vehicle . Boozed-up Surkov and Burkaev are said to have accused fellow party guest Sidor Fokine, 22, of stealing their mobile phones. When he denied it, they flew into a rage and pulled out their knives. Then they knifed him in front of the other guests - who were all female. But they feared that the young women would identify them as the killers. So they knifed them too, including 16-year-old Maria Sorokina, in whose flat they were partying, and her 17-year-old friend Anastasia Selezneva. Scene of carnage: Police officers at the apartment block in\u00a0Kumertau where five young people were killed . The other victims were aged 21 and 22. Anastasia was the last to be murdered - and she was raped before her brutal death.\u00a0The five bodies were set on fire in the apartment. A police spokesman said of Surkov and Burkaev: 'They were apprehended while trying to escape in a stolen car. They were covered in blood and still drunk. 'So far they have only said they did it because they were drunk.'",

Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald, who embark on their latest UK tour tomorrow, were told to pay back the cash 11 months ago after the 'investment' scheme they put millions into was ruled invalid. It is understood the trio are dealing directly with HMRC but have yet to stump up the cash. Scroll down for video . Fury: Take That members (from left) Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen have still not paid back the \u00a320million they owe the taxman, one year after they were ordered to. The band begin their UK tour tomorrow . A source close to the band said: 'They are not appealing the decision, they are dealing directly with HMRC.' The delay has been criticised by The Taxpayers' Alliance, with pressure mounting further by the fact that TV sports presenter Gabby Logan has already fulfilled her promise to pay back all the money she owed from the 'tax shelter' scheme, according to the\u00a0Sunday Mirror. Andy Silvester, campaign director, said: 'Everyone should play by the rules, and that means paying back on time if HMRC say so. 'However, the real moral of this story is that we desperately need to simplify the tax code to get rid of the loopholes that those with clever accountants can drive a Take That tour bus through. 'Politicians make an awful lot of noise about tax evasion and avoidance but are addressing the symptom rather than the cause.' The Take That trio have not appealed against last May's tax tribunal ruling that the Icebreaker scheme they paid millions of pounds into was created as a way of exploiting legal loopholes. Repaid: Other well-known clients who used the Icebreaker 'investment' scheme include TV sports presenter Gabby Logan (pictured right). Unlike Gary Barlow (left), she has already repaid everything she owed . Prime Minister David Cameron used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to get tax avoiders to return \u00a35billion . Money poured into Icebreaker, which used investment in the music industry to gain tax reliefs aimed at boosting the UK's creative industries, did not attract income tax. Icebreaker officials claimed that the initiative was funding music, supporting little-known artists to famous names such as Sinead O'Connor. But it was ruled by Judge Colin Bishopp that the scheme was mainly for tax avoidance rather than investments. Many of the 1,000 clients who invested in Icebreaker claimed they did not know the scheme broke any rules. David Cameron has previously used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to have \u00a35billion returned by tax avoiders. There is no suggestion Robbie Williams or Jason Orange took part in the Icebreaker scheme, which saw more than 7,000 repayment notices, totaling \u00a31.6billion, issued by HMRC as part of a crackdown. A spokesman for Barlow, Owen and Donald said: 'I can confirm that Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald have now received confirmation from HMRC that their tax affairs are fully up to date.'",

The male headmaster of a leading all-girls\u2019 grammar school has been sacked after sending a series of private emails to a teenage pupil, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Peter Gale, 47, was dismissed by Nonsuch High School For Girls in Surrey for \u2018unprofessional and inappropriate conduct\u2019 two weeks ago. At the time of the announcement, the school\u2019s governors failed to release any more details. However, an investigation by this newspaper has discovered that Mr Gale \u2013 who became the academy\u2019s first male head when he was appointed to the post 18 months ago \u2013 sent informal emails over a period of months to the sixth-form pupil, including messages written at night and during the holidays. School rules strictly forbid teachers sending messages to pupils from private email accounts. The Cheam academy has described Mr Gale\u2019s actions a \u2018serious breach of safeguarding procedures\u2019. Despite this, the National Union of Teachers appeared to play down the seriousness of his conduct. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday, the union implied Mr Gale\u2019s actions only amounted to a breach of the school\u2019s information and communications technology rules. The governors \u2013 who began their investigation following a tip-off \u2013 are said to have been \u2018stunned\u2019 by the NUT statement. The specialist science college and languages school, which counts singer Katie Melua and Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell among its alumni, passed judgment on Mr Gale at an internal disciplinary hearing earlier this month, ruling he had broken rules in place to prevent personal communications between staff and pupils. It is understood this was in breach of guidance telling teachers never to use a private email account to send messages to pupils, partly for their own protection. The school has refused to reveal the precise content of the emails, but it is understood they were informal and read like text messages. It is believed there were also concerns about the way Mr Gale, the former deputy headmaster of all-girl Rosebery School in nearby Epsom, had treated the student differently from other pupils. Mr Gale, who is understood to be unmarried and who lives in Godalming, Surrey, declined to comment directly to The Mail on Sunday. Messages: An investigation by the Mail on Sunday has revealed it was a series of 'informal' emails to a sixth form pupil which led to his dismissal from the specialist science college \u00a0(pictured) Alumni: Former pupils include Kate Melua (pictured) and\u00a0Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell . But a statement sent to this newspaper, released by the NUT\u2019s London Regional Secretary Bob Stapley, said: \u2018The alleged misconduct related to communication with a student which breached the school\u2019s policy on the accepted use of ICT [information and communications technology]. \u2018Mr Gale accepted he had breached the school\u2019s policy and that as headmaster he had responsibility for ensuring he and other staff acted in accordance with the policy. Defence: The NUT have said: 'Mr Gale vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made'. Pictured: The school's motto . \u2018Mr Gale vehemently denies he behaved inappropriately towards any student and no such finding was made. Mr Gale appreciates that this placed governors in a difficult situation given that rumours could have a negative effect upon the reputation of the school.\u2019 The statement added he was considering whether to appeal against \u2018the severity of the sanction imposed by the Disciplinary Panel\u2019. Chairman of governors, Tony Hyams-Parish, said in a letter to parents this month: \u2018The governing body has terminated Peter Gale\u2019s employment at Nonsuch High School for Girls due to serious breaches in applying safeguarding procedures and instances of unprofessional and inappropriate conduct. \u2018This was not an easy decision, especially because we recognise that since Peter\u2019s appointment there have been many positive changes within the school led by Peter and the senior leadership team. \u2018However, the governing body and staff take their safeguarding responsibilities towards students very seriously and, importantly, any breaches of safeguarding procedures, and have therefore acted promptly to address these matters.\u2019 Carol Dickie, the school\u2019s bursar, said the education of the 1,200 pupils would be unaffected by the sacking, despite it coming just weeks before GCSE and A-level exams.",

Police across Malawi have been ordered to shoot anyone caught attacking albinos, while Tanzania's prime minister has urged citizens to kill anyone found with albino body parts. And in nearby Burundi, albino youngsters from across East Africa are being housed in special accommodation under army protection in a bid to deter attackers. Scroll down for video . Dorothy Mausen, a 22-year-old Malawian albino woman, poses for a photo in the country's Machinga district . Malawian police have been ordered to crack down on those trading in albino body parts, with orders recently given to shoot anyone caught attacking them . The drastic developments come as the United Nations reports at least 15 people with albinism, mostly children, have been killed, wounded, abducted or kidnapped in East Africa in the past six months. Body parts of those with albinism are prized in black magic and witchcraft, as it is believed spells based on their body parts will bring luck, love and wealth. Nearby Burundi has also taken steps to safeguard albinos by accommodating them in housing under protection. The latest order came from Malawi's Inspector General of Police Lexen Kachama who instructed police to shoot any 'dangerous criminals' caught abducting albinos, according to local media reports. 'Shoot every criminal who is violent when caught red-handed abducting people with albinism,' said Kachama, adding that he was ordering police to use weapons in proportion to the crime. 'We cannot just watch while our friends with albinism are being killed like animals every day. 'We do realize that these people are ruthless, have no mercy and therefore they need to be treated just like that.' His comments came just a month after a Malawian man was arrested for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy. Catherine Amidu, 12, sits in her home Malawian home, in a region where six albinos have been killed since December . Femia Tchulani, 42, lives in constant fear of attackers who target and kill albinos in order to sell their body parts on the black market . Village chief Mariam Witness stands in a graveyard where the grave of an albino person was recently desecrated. Body part traders are known to exhume graves in order to obtain body parts in the cruel trade . A similar remark was made by Tanzania's Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda in 2009 when he urged citizens to kill anyone on the spot if they were found with the limbs or organs of albinos. Albino rights group have called for greater protection of albinos but said killing suspects was not going to deter criminals offered large sums of money for securing body parts as they were likely to still take the risk for the promised reward. Witchdoctors will pay as much as $75,000 for a full set of albino body parts, according to a Red Cross report. Vicky Ntetema, executive director of Under The Same Sun, a Canadian non-profit organization defending albino rights, said campaigners wanted justice for those people kidnapped, mutilated and murdered. 'But we have to remember that all those goons caught red-handed ... are small fish - agents and executors of the big sharks out there,' she said. 'Killing them on the spot is not going to help us catch the inducers, those with money to hire these gangs who continue to terrorize innocent people with albinism and their families.' An albino boy sits between his two parents at their home in Malawi . Ntetema urged police in Tanzania, Malawi and Burundi to quiz suspects to get information about the witchdoctors who use albino body parts and their clients. 'We all need to unite and find the culprits who are hiding behind the killers ... Why would people kill albinos if they were not asked to get their organs by someone?' she said. The plight of people with albinism has worsened in East Africa in recent years, according to U.N. and police figures, with concerns that an election in Tanzania this year will prompt more attacks as politicians seek luck at the ballot box. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Said Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein last month urged African governments to combat impunity for crimes against people with albinism. Albinism is a congenital disorder which affects about one in 20,000 people worldwide, according to medical authorities. It is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and affects about one Tanzanian in 1,400.

But the team behind a new app clearly feel that the tiny rendition of a rumba blaring from your mobile is not enough to drag you from beneath the covers. Instead they have developed an alarm that will only turn off if you physically get out of bed and scan a bar code in another part of your house. Scroll down for video . The I'm UP Alarm can be set to go off the night before (left) and will then only turn off by scanning a QR code (pictured right) on a mug or magnet that can be kept in another room, forcing you to get out of bed to do so . Michael Smagon, the New York-based inventor of the I'm Up Alarm, said: 'We all hit the snooze, toss and turn, and fall back asleep. Then we do the morning dash because we lose those coveted morning minutes. 'I\u2019m Up is a mobile app alarm clock that is linked to a QR code that may be anywhere in your home, not in arms reach form bed, and the alarm does not go off until your scan the code, hence getting out of bed.' Smartphone users will be able to download the app onto their phone from June. Each device is paired with a specific QR code that can be printed out and stuck somewhere else in the house. The app developers also say they will be able to print the code onto mugs or magnetic buttons so they can be left in the kitchen to scan while you make your morning coffee. The alarm is set to go off at a certain time the night before and will make a noise until the QR code is scanned. The app uses a Quick Response code, or QR code, which is a form of barcode that the cameras of mobile phones are able to detect. Under Mr Smagon's concept, a code matched specifically to your app can be printed on your favourite mug or a fridge magnet. When the alarm goes off at the designated time, the only way to then get it to stop making a noise is to get out of bed and scan the code. For those who really need an extra couple of minutes, Mr Smagon says the app does have a snooze function, but only for a set number of occasions. He is currently seeking funding on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter to help him test the device. The app is due to be released in June\u00a0June and and will come as a free version with adverts or an ad-free version which will cost less than $8, or \u00a35.48. The alarm app will have a snooze function but it will only allow users to delay getting up a set number of times . Mugs and magnetic business cards and buttons with the codes printed on them can also be purchased and shipped worldwide or a free code can be printed from the company's website. I'm Up will be available on Apple and Android phones and a version for Windows phones is being developed. Mr Smagon said: 'In the evening you set your alarm for 6am and you have the best intention to wake up at this time, but in the morning everything looks different. 'Every excuse you come up with just to stay those five extra minutes in bed wins. We all know that those five minute snoozes quickly add up and all of a sudden we are late again. 'I'm Up alarm was invented to help people who are not one of those early birds to start the day.' The QR code can be printed onto coffee cups so users can turn off the alarm while making their morning drink .",

In January 2013, Dorian Poe, from Burlington, Ontario, sent his favorite toy out on the global adventure, having been inspired by the story of a cancer-stricken girl who, unable to live her own dreams of world travel, sent her teddy bear in her place. Hoping to raise the same level of global awareness about his own condition, Dorian decided to send his Ganz Webkinz bear, called Tikko, out into the world, carrying with him a message of understanding and tolerance for those affected by autism. Scroll down for video . 'It's okay to be different': Dorian Poe, 11, with his beloved bear Tikko, whose travels have raised awareness for autism all over the world . With the help and support of his mother Christine, Dorian, who was then nine years old, sent Tikko off on the first leg of his adventure in back in January 2013. Now, the bear has circled the globe and then some, continuing to share his vital message, while inviting the world to join in with his journey\u00a0online. 'When I first decided to support Dorian in his campaign, it was because I was happy to see him want to \u201cpay it forward\u201d' Christine tells DailyMail.com. 'I fundraise each year to pay the $24,500.00/year tuition it costs for Dorian to go to a special needs school. I was thrilled to support Tikko because Dorian had found a way to give back to our community; a community that has been wonderful at supporting our fundraising efforts.' Hello, my name is Dorian. I have autism, and so does my pet polar bear Tikko. Tikko is about to go traveling on an adventure; and I need you to take care of him. My polar bear wants to raise autism awareness. Just call him 'Tikko the Autism Bear' or 'Tikko'. Guess what, this guy is much more different than the other polar bears you know. Things you should look out for: . To accompany Tikko the autistic bear on his adventures, Dorian included a letter explaining the characteristics and challenges involved in having autism \u2013 using the toy to help other people understand what the various aspects of the condition can feel like. Each family who receivedTikko on his travels would take on the job of raising awareness in his or her community \u2013 helping to spread Dorian\u2019s message across the globe, while he remained at home in Canada. But the mother and son could never have known what a phenomenon Tikko would become. 'In January when Tikko took his first trip to Jamaica, I connected with another mom there whose child had autism,' Christine explains. 'There was little to no support for autism in Jamaica.' Hearing such a story from so far away, Christine began to research autism in the other countries Tikko was visiting, and she shared what she learned on the campaign's Facebook page. And two weeks after the Tikko had begun his adventures, Christine became involved in coordinating them. After media attention grew, and demand for visits from Tikko increased, Christine received a donation of new Tikkos from toy company GANZ, who offered 600 bears to the cause in order to help the family cope with the overwhelming amount of interest. \u2018For the first few months there was only one Tikko,\u2019 Christine explained. \u2018It wasn\u2019t long before we realized we could reach people faster by having more Tikko\u2019s available. So I wrote to GANZ (the maker of the Webkinz Polar Bear), and to date they have donated 600 polar bears to us!\u2019 With so many Tikko bears in the mix, running the campaign became a full-time job for Christine. At the gate: Tikko made it to 24 countries in his first 10 months of traveling . A towering success: The little bear has made it to some of the world's most instantly-recognizable landmarks . She keeps supporters informed with daily updates on Tikko's location on Facebook and Twitter, receives new Tikko travel photos every day, and promotes the awareness campaign across autism networking sites. However, Christine says: 'No matter how busy I am, I always have time to listen and offer support to those dealing with the challenges of having a child on the spectrum.' Tikko's\u00a0Facebook page documents every destination he has reached in dozens of photos. He's posed at some of the world's most famous landmarks, hobnobbed with A-list celebrities, and even\u00a0scraped the skies in a daring aerial show, all the while broadcasting the important message splashed across his T-shirt: 'Autism\u2026it\u2019s okay to be different!' The campaign has affected children all over the world who have autism, not in the least the young boy who started it all. A message in motion: Tikko spreads awareness with his motto:\u00a0'Autism\u2026it\u2019s okay to be different!' Getting back to his roots: Tikko has even made it as far as the North Pole, which was a dream of owner Dorian . 'Dorian feels a sense of purpose,' says mom Christine. 'He feels he is not only helping the world, but also his school peers. He\u2019s gained confidence, and he\u2019s made & kept friends more easily.

The wall-mounted device  creates a \u2018personal sunrise\u2019 and emits focused ultrasonic waves to wake up each person in bed individually without disturbing their partner. Scroll down for video . The alarm clock, called Wak\u0113 (pictured) rouses individuals from their slumber one at a time using a focused beam of light and sound. The wall-mounted device creates a \u2018personal sunrise\u2019 and emits focused ultrasonic waves to wake up each person in bed individually without disturbing their partner . It uses a white LED to slowly illuminate the area around a sleeper\u2019s face to gently wake them up, with the aim of making them feel alert faster. Instead of relying on cameras, the device uses a sensor to pick out individuals using body heat. It also has built in rechargeable batteries and a Wi-Fi connected processor so it works with a phone app that's used to differentiate between sleepers. Mounted on a wall, the gadget pivots to send a focused beam of sound towards one sleeper that is emitted by a parametric speaker. Parametric speakers use ultrasonic waves to create a very narrow, audible beam, which should only be heard by one sleeper, allowing their partner to continue to doze. The alarm clock  pivots (pictured) to make sure it targets a person accurately, even if a couple are cuddled up . The Wak\u0113 alarm is affixed to the wall behind the bed. It has an inbuilt sensor to detect sleepers' body heat. The device pivots and sends a directed beam of light and sound to rouse an individual. It partners with an app so that users can tell the device which side of the bed they sleep on and when they want to wake up. At the same time, an LED light grows brighter to simulate sunlight, encouraging a sleeper to wake up more naturally. \u2018Wak\u0113 uses a parametric speaker (like a laser beam of sound) to deliver focused, soothing sounds that start quietly, and grow louder slowly as the light beam grows brighter,\u2019 according to the device\u2019s Kickstarter\u00a0page. \u2018Since Wak\u0113\u2019s light and sound is aimed at you, your partner can rest peacefully while you wake up energised.\u2019 The device has been invented by Los Angeles-based firm Lucera Labs. It is hoping to raise $100,000 (\u00a366,934) on the crowdfunding site to put the alarm clock into production. The alarm uses a white LED to slowly slowly illuminate the area around a sleeper\u2019s face (pictured) to gently wake them up, with the aim of making them feel alert faster . Wak\u0113 uses a parametric speaker, like a laser beam of sound, to deliver 'focused, soothing sounds that start quietly, and grow louder. Parametric speakers use ultrasonic waves to create narrow, audible beams. This diagram shows how the Wak\u0113 gadget works . The Wak\u0113 app (three screenshots are shown) works like a regular alarm clock app so users can tell it which side of the bed they sleep on and how and when they want to wake up . \u2018Once you're awoken, Wak\u0113 will reposition itself should you roll over and shut itself off when you get up,\u2019 the company continued. \u2018You can always snooze or deactivate any alarm using the Wak\u0113 app.\u2019 The Wak\u0113 app works like a regular alarm clock app so users can say how and when they want to wake up, hit the snooze button and, importantly, tell the device which side of the bed they sleep on. The alarm costs $250 (\u00a3167) to pre-order on Kickstarter and is due to ship in September. Using a traditional alarm clock or mobile phone alarm can be annoying for couples who wake up or need to get up for work at different times, as one of them cannot carry on sleeping (illustrated with a stock image) Instead of using cameras, the device uses a sensor to pick out individuals using body heat.

Social Services Minister Scott Morrison confirms that the government is actively researching possible legislation changes, as conscientious objectors are currently able to use a loophole to access family tax benefits. The hard-line approach to immunisation comes one month after the tragic death of 32-day -old Perth baby Riley Hughes who died after contracting whooping cough. A subsequent galaxy poll found that 87 per cent of Australians believe vaccinations should be mandatory. Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough . Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital . Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children must give up their childcare payments from the government unless care is quarantined to the home, according to the Productivity Commission's report into childcare . The national immunisation program current outlines that parents must vaccinate their children to be eligible for family payments and childcare rebates. However, people who choose not to vaccinate their children for philosophical, personal or religious beliefs are able to apply for an exemption \u2013 meaning they can still access the payments without immunising their children. They can seek exemptions if a doctor signs a form showing they understand the risks to their child if they don't get vaccinated. A form must also be filled out, declaring the individual does not vaccinate their baby due to \u201cpersonal, philosophical, religious or medical beliefs involving a conviction that vaccination should not take place\u201d, they are still able to access the benefits. Mr Morrison believes there is essentially no excuse to excuse a parent when they decide not to vaccinate their child, especially as the decision could be potentially fatal for other children. While parents are required to vaccinate their children to receive benefits, they can seek exemptions if a doctor signs a form showing they understand the risks to their child if they don't get vaccinated . \u201cWe believe that, unless you\u2019re someone with a really deep held religious view there should be no exceptions and you should be getting your children immunised,\u201d the Opposition leader told Nine\u2019s Weekend Today. \u201cThe idea that your child\u2019s going to a childcare centre and that some other parent doesn\u2019t feel they like the science of immunisation, and therefore they come along and your child or anyone else\u2019s child could catch something because some other parent has an opinion, that isn\u2019t really good enough is it,\u201d he said. It\u2019s hoped a change to the governments benefit packages will motivate anti-vaccinators to immunise their children. \u201cThe Government is reviewing the current exemptions on vaccinations that apply to family tax benefit payments and child care subsidies as part of the families package to be delivered this year,\u201d Mr Morrison told News Corp. The Productivity Commission's report now recommends rebates 'be conditional on the child being fully immunised, unless care occurs in the child's home' In February, the Productivity Commission handed down a report which recommended that rebates \u2018be conditional on the child being fully immunised, unless care occurs in the child's home'. Childcare centres in NSW can ban children that are not immunised and other states are currently considering similar tough stances. Labor leader Bill Shorten told the Sunday Telegraph\u00a0the commission's recommendation were a 'common-sense measure'. 'Kids deserve to grow up safe and healthy. I'm not comfortable with the idea of subsidising people who put kids' health at risk,' he said. 'Childcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with. Families who do the right thing by immunising their child shouldn't have to worry about whether their child is going to pick up a preventable illness at their childcare centre.' Social Services Minister Scott Morrison said he was open to anything in the report and admitted it made some\u00a0very important suggestions in the area of immunisations .",

Mark Carney was spotted on a day off from helping to run the economy jogging in London\u2019s Hyde Park sporting a high-tech running belt with no fewer than four water bottles. The keen runner, who training for the London Marathon later this month, was wearing a Nathan Speed 4 Fuel Belt, which also features a zip pocket perfect for storing high-carb energy gel packs. The belt is available for $64.95 (\u00a335) at Kintec, a Canadian sports retailer based in Vancouver, suggesting Mr Carney, originally from Canada, bought it before he moved to the UK. He was also wearing headphones and top-of-the range running shoes. His adidas Energy Boost ESM Shoes, in green and black, cost \u00a3120.

Mr Carney, in charge of the world\u2019s sixth largest economy, completed his look with a grey jumper, which was drenched in sweat by the end of his training session. The father of four daughters, who turned 50 last week, is known to be a keen sportsman and likes to keep fit. At Harvard, he played in goal for his ice hockey team. In 2011, he completed in Canada\u2019s Ottawa marathon, finishing the 26.2-mile sprint in just three hours and 48 minutes in 2011 \u2013 an hour and 40 minutes shy of the winning time that year. He continued running when he moved to London to become the Bank of England chief in 2013, and is known to sometimes run from his home to Bank\u2019s headquarters in the City of London to avoid the traffic. \u2018Like many other Londoners I do run to work or home from work from time to time,\u2019 he said in an interview.

President Barack Obama's spokesman refused to give reporters an update on the status of the meetings or scheduling, saying he would leave those announcements to negotiators. But he confirmed that 'the sense that we have is yes, that the talks continue to be productive and that progress is being made.' Speculation was swirling on Wednesday afternoon that representatives from the six countries, including the U.S., participating in the Switzerland-based discussions with Iran in were on the verge of making a deal as French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius rushed back to Lausanne. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, right, checks his watch outside the Beau Rivage Palace Hotel in a break during Iran nuclear program talks in Lausanne. Six world powers and Iran are still trying to reach a preliminary accord on reining in Tehran's nuclear program, after failing to agree crucial details such as the lifting of U.N. sanctions by a midnight deadline the day before . German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had said earlier in the day that his French counterpart would come back once the discussions 'enter a decisive stage.' A French official told Reuters Fabius' return should not be interpreted to mean a deal was imminent, however. Already on hand were U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. A spokesman for Kerry said Wednesday afternoon that the cabinet-level official would remain in Switzerland overnight and indicated that a political 'understanding' with Iran had not yet been reached. Journalists covering the talks in Switzerland were provided with a 'lid,' or promise that no news would be made, until at least the wee hours of Thursday morning, meaning news of a deal, if one is in the works, could come as early as Wednesday evening on the East Coast. The White House's top spokesman Josh Earnest cautiously discussed the ongoing talks as he fielded more than a dozen pointed questions on the subject during his daily briefing Wednesday afternoon. Rotating between tough talk and a soft-handed approach, Earnest said 'the time has come for the Iranian negotiators to begin to make the kind of serious commitments that international community, including the United States, will insist upon. 'While the talks have been productive, we have not yet received the specific tangible commitments that the international community seeks.' Discussions were scheduled to cease at Midnight on Tuesday if Iran was still unwilling to agree to terms set forth by Russia, China, Britain, Germany, the U.S. and France, known globally as the P5+1. The White House had last week said that March 31 was a hard deadline for a preliminary accord, to be formalized by June 30, and that talks had dragged on long enough. As the clocked ticked down, however, it made an about-face and said the U.S. would continue to work toward a deal as long as it felt progress was being made. Earnest said Wednesday that the United States' thinking 'hasn't changed' and it would not 'arbitrarily' or 'abruptly' end talks if it made sense to continue. At the same time, he said, if the U.S. sense that 'the talks have stalled' they, in conjunction with the international community, would walk away. GOOD NEWS ON THE WAY? From left: British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Senior Director at the National Security Council Robert Malley and Kerry chat during a break in discussions . STALL TACTICS:\u00a0President Barack Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, refused to give reporters an update on the status of the meetings or scheduling on Wednesday afternoon, saying he would leave those announcements to negotiators . He rejected the notion that the U.S. was giving Iran too much 'leeway' in the talks, telling a reporter, we are 'insisting on a good deal.' A good deal, the White House said said on repeat, is one that would stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and the president will not accept a 'bad deal.' What would happen if an acceptable deal cannot be reached was unclear as the White House was won't to engage in hypothetical scenarios. 'I am at this point reluctant to fast forward to what would happen at the end of the day if an agreement is not reached because they are still discussing an agreement right now as we speak,' Earnest told reporters. If diplomacy, fails, he said that the 'military option' would be considered as would additional sanctions. The White House has resisted bipartisan efforts to put new restrictions on Iran throughout the last several months, saying it would veto sanctions legislation if it came to the president's desk. 'But yeah, if those negotiations break down and the Iranians walk away without demonstrating the willingness to make some serious commitments, then that does bring some of those issues back into play,' Earnest said Wednesday. 'We'll evaluate that when we come to it.' Senators have said they will begin voting on legislation to insert themselves into the process after they return from their Passover-Easter break on April 13 if the White House hasn't sealed a deal. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with the White House's national security team, participate on Tuesday in a secure video teleconference from the Situation Room of the White House with Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and the U.S. team in Lausanne, Switzerland . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Wednesday morning that 'ministers have reached a general agreement on all key aspects of a final settlement of this issue.' Asserting that 'it will be put down in writing over the next few hours, maybe during the day, Lavrov added. And Britain's Hammond said, 'I think we have a broad framework of understanding, but there are still some key issues that have to be worked through.' 'Some of them are quite detailed and technical so there is still quite a lot of work to do but we are on it now and we'll keep going at it,' he noted. U.S. diplomats said it was 'not true,' as Lavrov suggested, that key issues had been worked out. The White House's spokesman did not directly deny that an agreement was already being drafted when he spoke to reporters later that day. 'I think I would only point out that there's not a significant difference between those two verbs,' he said after a reporter asked him if talks had moved on from the negotiation stage to the drafting stage. 'It's possible to do both,' he said, playing coy. 'It's possible to negotiate as you draft or to draft as you negotiate.' A source on the ground in Switzerland following the talks told Daily Mail Online that it 'would shock everybody here' if Iran conceded to the international community's demands to significantly scale back its uranium enrichment program and ship out much of what it has already produced because 'there is no indication that the parties have moved.' The source described the situation as a 's***show' at this point and said negotiators are poised to 'limp across' the finish line. 'The Americans desperately needed something to come back to Congress with,' the source said, predicting that the Obama administration will make a 'face-saving concession' that will be announced late tonight or early tomorrow morning. The White House told reporters on Wednesday that whether a pact is made in the end or not, the president will address the public to explain the administration's rationale.",

At first, Mrs Hills thought her kids had a bad cold, but then she heard their deep, booming cough that made them gag and vomit - 'the kind of cough that stops a parent's heart,' she recalled to National Post. After looking up the symptoms online - powerful coughing fits, runny nose, stringy phlegm - the Hills took their ailing brood to the hospital on the morning of April 2. Scroll down for video . Change of heart: Tara and Gavin Hills, have been anti-vaxxers for six years, but all that changed when their seven young children came down with whooping cough . Public confession: Mrs Hills, pictured left and right with her husband, penned a blog post about her decision to ditch the anti-vaxxer stance . Large brood: The Hills' six sons and a daughter between the ages of 10 months and 10 years (pictured) remain in quarantine and are being treated with antibiotics . Four days later, lab tests confirmed whooping cough - an infection of the respiratory system characterized by severe coughing spells, which mainly affects infants and children between the ages of 11 and 18. According to KidsHealth.org, before a vaccine was developed, whooping cough - also known as pertussis - killed up to 10,000 people in the US annually. The introduction of the vaccine has reduced the number of fatalities caused by the infection each year to 30, but in recent years the number of cases has been on the rise. Tara Hills said she and her husband had their first three children partially vaccinated, but then stopped because they have grown suspicious of what she described on her blog, The ScientificParent.com, as the 'Big Pharma-Government-Media conspiracy.' Weary: Tara wrote that she and her husband decided to stop vaccinating their children because they didn't trust the health care system . At risk: The Hills' three eldest kids were partially vaccinated, but the four youngest ones got no shots at all, leaving them vulnerable . 'Were these vaccines even necessary in this day and age?' Mrs Hills wrote. 'Were we unwittingly doing greater harm than help to our beloved children? So much smoke must mean a fire so we defaulted to the \"do nothing and hope nothing bad happens\" position.' The Hills first began questioning their controversial anti-vaxxer stance after hearing of a massive measles outbreak at Disneyland earlier this year. At first, the parents' fear of contagion proved weaker than their mistrust of the medical system. But then Tara and her husband started looking at information from government agencies and reputable health organizations. In an ironic twist - one of many in the story of the Hills' evolution as anti-vaxxers - their children have been scheduled to get their first shots soon when whooping cough struck, reported CTV News. 'I looked again at the science and evidence for community immunity and found myself gripped with a very real sense of personal and social responsibility before God and man,\u2019 Tara Hills wrote on her blog, adding that one of her main concerns was that her kids may have infected her sister's unvaccinated infant. The Hills' youngest children are still battling the illness, but are expected to recover . Her six sons and a daughter ranging in age from 10 months to 10 years have been ordered to remain in quarantine at their house in Kanata until they stop being contagious, which will take five days. On Thursday, Mrs Hills said her two eldest children have turned a corner and are now on the mend, while the younger kids are still battling the illness with the help of antibiotics. In her blog post titled Learning the Hard Way: My Journey from #AntiVaxx to Science, which has been viewed more than 2million times, Hills acknowledged the awkward position she has found herself in. 'I\u2019m writing this from quarantine, the irony of which isn\u2019t lost on me,' she wrote. 'I am not looking forward to any gloating or shame as this 'defection' from the antivaxx camp goes public, but this isn't a popularity contest. Right now my family is living the consequences of misinformation and fear.'",

Currently mobile phone companies charge customers up to 20p a minute to dial what are free numbers from a landline phone. The net result is that millions of people dialling what should be free services run by the NHS, the government and company call centres end up paying hefty charges. Scroll down for video . End call: Charges of up to 20p a minute being charged by operators for free 0800 numbers will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today . Alternatively, some who rely on mobile phones rather than landlines are put off accessing these services by the cost. The charges will end from July 1 under proposals published by the telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, today. The changes were fought by the mobile phone networks, which have been making tens of millions of pounds a year from customers calling the numbers. In 2013, the biggest mobile network, EE, even threatened to take legal action to block the move. At the time, the company, which is about to be taken over by BT in a deal worth \u00a312.5billion, complained getting rid of charges for 0800 numbers was \u2018ill thought out\u2019 and would \u2018crush an already struggling industry segment\u2019. It argued the change could cost up to \u00a357.5 million to implement and that mobile networks would simply put up other charges to make up for any lost income. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at the price comparison service, uSwitch.com, said the end to mobile charges to call 0800 numbers was a \u2018long-overdue victory for common-sense\u2019. EE claims the plan is ill thought out and will make an already struggling industry suffer . A spokesman for the telecoms price comparison website, broadbandchoices.co.uk, welcomed moves to make the price of calls clearer to consumers. He said: \u2018Making \u20180800\u2019 numbers free from all telephones including mobile phones is excellent news since it\u2019s rarely practical to redial from a landline to avoid charges for what are generally assumed to be \u2018free phone\u2019 numbers. \u2018Greater cost transparency and simplicity of charging is badly needed in the landline and mobile phone sector. We regularly hear from consumers who are confronted with charges on their phone bill that they were unaware of.\u2019 The changes are part of a wider shake-up in call charges to non-geographic numbers, which are described by Ofcom as the \u2018biggest overhaul of phone calls in more than a decade\u2019. They are part of a new regime imposing new rules covering the cost of calling the 084, 087 and 09 numbers used in TV show phone polls, by businesses, GP surgeries and government departments \u2013 as well as 118 directory enquiry numbers. At the moment, the cost of calling these numbers is mired in confusion with charges varying enormously depending on whether you are using a landline or a mobile phone. In future, organisations using these numbers will be required to advertise a single \u2018service charge\u2019 for dialling them. Separately, each phone company will apply an \u2018access charge\u2019 for putting people through. Consumers will add the two figures together to work out the full cost, which will vary depending on which phone company they are signed to. Ofcom and phone companies will be publicising the changes under the banner UK Calling before the switch in the summer. The regulator\u2019s chief executive, Sharon White, said: \u2018In July we\u2019ll see the biggest changes to phone calls in over a decade, affecting 175 million phone numbers. \u2018The changes are important for people who enjoy interacting with their favourite shows, but also for everyone calling companies and organisations on 08, 09 and 118 numbers. s.poulter@dailymail.co.uk .",

The nine-time French Open winner began the second set in the same steady form and broke Pouille twice to serve for the match at 5-1. He arrowed a vintage forehand down the line to seal a place in the third round, where he will face either John Isner or Viktor Troicki. The Spaniard is an eight-time champion in Monte Carlo, but has not won here since 2012 and said last week that he is \u2018not the favourite for anything\u2019 at the moment. Frenchman\u00a0Pouille showed glimpses of his talent but was unable to trouble Nadal . Nadal is an eight-time champion at Monte Carlo but hasn't won the tournament since 2012 . This victory was the first step in rebuilding his self-belief after disappointing losses in the quarter-finals of the Indian Wells Masters and the third round in Miami last month. It is too early to say that the king of clay is back to his best, and he will face sterner tests later in the week, but he could not have asked for a better opening display.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nSergio Ramos was the first man Carlo Ancelotti embraced at the final whistle of Real Madrid\u2019s dramatic Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Asked after the game when it was that he had decided to move the defender forward into midfield to cover the absence of Luka Modric, he replied: \u2018The minute after I found out Modric was injured\u2019. The two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night. Ramos is one of those players for whom the old Liverpool song about Jamie Carragher \u2018We all dream of a team of Carraghers\u2019 would be appropriate. He could play in every single position on the pitch. Sergio Ramos (left) celebrates with Javier Hernandez (centre) and Pepe after Real's winning goal . Ramos gees up the crowd during another all-action display at the Santiago Bernabeu for Real Madrid . It was a fiery Madrid derby on Wednesday night, but Ramos (left) once again proved his worth to Real . He often fools around in goal at Spain training. He started his Real Madrid career as a right back and won the European Championship there for his country. He has filled in at left-back, can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker. Had he been born British he would probably have grown up as a box-to-box midfielder. In Spain midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre-back and that is where he has settled. On Wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no-one down. And that\u2019s the thing about Ramos. He very rarely lets anyone down. He is Real Madrid\u2019s Carles Puyol \u2013 the all-action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the Champions League final and heads in a corner that equalises Atletico Madrid\u2019s 1-0 lead in injury time, allowing Real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy. Ramos heads away from his own penalty area, but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield . The makeshift midfielder holds off Atletico Madrid's Koke during a superb display in the middle of the park . And when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against Bayern Munich in 2010 in the Champions League semi-final when he sent his kick \u2013 at least as far as Twitter was concerned \u2013 into outer space, he has the guts to take another one in the European Championship final a couple of months later, and not only score but dink it Panenka style over the keeper\u2019s dive. He has been mocked in the past for his Colemanballs comments that usually amount to declaring himself \u2018happy with the three points\u2019 after a cup game or \u2018looking forward to the second leg\u2019 after a league game, but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him. It always seemed that even Jose Mourinho during his fall-out with Iker Casillas could never really properly fall out with Casillas' ally Ramos because there was too much about him that he admired. Ramos too, while ultimately siding with Spain team-mate Casillas, always saw the worth of a bold and proactive manager. The Spanish centre-back celebrates his crucial, last-minute goal in last year's Champions League final . Ramos has shown character to bounce back from his errors, as his penalty for Spain in 2012 showed . His supporters believe he stands for a dignity that many feel is disappearing from the game. \u2018I like managers to be nice guys but I also like them to have balls\u2019 he said of Ancelotti\u2019s decision to play him out of his usual position against Atletico. \u2018We would both have never heard the end of it had we been knocked out\u2019 he said after that 1-0 win with him deployed to win aerial duels with Mario Mandzukic who Ancelotti had noted dropped back into midfield to get on the end of Atletico keeper Jan Oblak\u2019s drop kicks. Real now have nine games left if they reach the Champions League final. Ramos will play in all of them no doubt. He may even cover for Modric again with the midfielder not back for another five weeks; he will play as an auxiliary striker if Real Madrid need a late goal, and he\u2019ll go in goal if the emergency presents itself. Someone really should teach Real Madrid supporters that song: \u2018We all dream of a team of Sergios\u2019",

Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her \u00a33 million home. Beyonc\u00e9 went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyonc\u00e9 was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview \u2013 one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyonc\u00e9 is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyonc\u00e9's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record \u2013 it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below). We'll be donning Mango's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style. Mango Chiffon Ruffle Dress . Visit site . Boohoo Laura Curve Column Dress . Visit site . Bec & Bridge Isis Angle Dress (now on sale for $178!) at Revolve . Visit site . Carven Cr\u00eape de Chine Dress at Barneys . Visit site . So what did that amount to? Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity \u2013 what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful\u2026 it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible \u2013 I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story \u2013 we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'",

A former Utah State University fraternity president who was arrested in March on suspicion of sexual assault was officially charged in First District Court on Friday. Ryan Wray, 26, was charged with second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse in relation to a series of alleged assaults that occurred between last October and his March 24 arrest. Wray, who served as the 2013 and 2014 Pi Kappa Alpha president, was tasked with keeping safe women who 'could no longer take care of themselves' at\u00a0parties at the off-campus frat house, the\u00a0Salt Lake Tribune\u00a0reported. A woman who went to a party at the 'Pike House' told police\u00a0she awoke to find Wray 'touching her inappropriately without her approval' according to KSL. The woman, who said she was drunk at the time, discussed the incident with other women who then reported having similar experiences. When Wray was brought in by the Logan City Police Department\u00a0for questioning, he confessed to groping the victim while she was passed out, the Herald Journal\u00a0reported. He also admitted to groping two other women.\u00a0So far only the first alleged victim filed a statement with police. All of the women were under 21. Wray was released on $10,000 bail after his arrest. Wray posted this picture on Facebook and wrote: 'Feel like being the new pres requires at least 1 frat selfie' A woman who went to a party at the 'Pike House' said she awoke to find Wray 'touching her inappropriately' The Pi Kappa Alpha chapter at USU decided to suspend Wray after his arrest and then also ceased operations .

My body repulsed me. I knew that I needed to turn around my life and properly get in shape. The Derby-based model, pictured in a plus-size campaign (left) and as she is today (right), was secretly 'repulsed' by her body, so she checked into a military-style fitness camp and lost three stone . Before she lost the weight, Rebecca, seen in her plus-size prime, scored a number of high profile campaigns, which could earn as much as \u00a32,000 for a day's shoot as a size 16 or size 18 . Impressive results: In spite of this, she knew she would never be happy unless she got into shape once and for all, so she checked into No 1 Boot Camp . 'Now I have the body that I always wanted, I hope to get work as a slimmer model.' For years Rebecca, who is single, was happy to cash in on her fuller figure by working as a plus-size model. She did a number of high profile campaigns which could earn as much as \u00a32,000 for a day's shoot as a size 16 or size 18. Rebecca appeared in promotions for High Street names like Ikea, Perfect Pizza and Butlins, who were keen to target customers of all sizes. But despite her success as a model, Rebecca had been battling her weight for years, fluctuating between 13 and 14 stone. She would often lose weight by following fad diets, but as quickly as she dropped the pounds they would pile back on, which was always good news for her modelling career. In spite of this, Rebecca knew she would never be happy unless she got into shape once and for all, so she checked into No 1 Boot Camp. Rebecca was stunned when she lost 10lbs in her first week at boot camp (pictured) 'That was all the encouragement I needed,' she remarked. 'All the pain I was going through was worth it. The trainers were very strict but very supportive and motivating' Farewell: Rebecca, pictured before she lost the weight, left boot camp and knew immediately that she would never be able to return to her job as plus-size model . Made In Chelsea stars Spencer Matthews and Binky Felstead both lost a stone in a week at the same camp, and Rebecca was at No 1 with James 'Arg' Argent from The Only Way Is Essex, who slimmed down after going through a spell in rehab. 'James was a lovely guy who mucked in with the rest of us and had no airs or graces,' she said. 'It's no surprise that he has lost so much weight because he was prepared to really knuckle down and get in shape.' As for herself, Rebecca was stunned when she lost 10lb in her first week. 'That was all the encouragement I needed,' she remarked. 'All the pain I was going through was worth it. The trainers were very strict but very supportive and motivating.' Rebecca left the camp and knew immediately that she would never be able to return to her job as plus-size model. 'I tried to carry on for a bit but it was never going to be work,' she said. 'All the dresses I was being asked to model were way too big for me. They were hanging off me and I knew that chapter in my life had come to end.' Now Rebecca has set up her own jewellery and gift business, Rebecca Louise, which she runs online and in pop-up shops across the UK. She is launching a new jewellery collection soon which is inscribed with the same self-belief quotes she feels helped her through her own tough times. 'My weight still fluctuates a bit,' Rebecca admits. 'I like to allow myself treats and nights out from time to time, but when I put on three pounds, I know it's time to stop and knuckle down.' Worth it: Rachel, who has kept the weight off, now runs a jewellery business and still hopes to find work as a slimmer model in the future .",

The teenager, identified as Zeynab Daghastani, was shot and killed as she made her way through the southern streets of the Al-Yarmouk Camp towards the nearby neighbourhood of Yalda. Zeynab was shot dead on the evening of April 7 last week according to a worker at the\u00a0Jafra Foundation, an aid organisation working in the area. Zeynab Daghastani, 13, was reportedly gunned down by ISIS snipers in Al-Yarmouk Camp, on the outskirts of Damascus, as she fled the militants (pictured, Islamic State fighters as they captured the camp ten days ago) According to relief workers in the area, Zeynab was killed on Tuesday as she tried to make her way from Yarmouk to a nearby neighbourhood controlled by the Syrian Army (pictured, ISIS fighters in Yarmouk) The worker, named only as Nina, also revealed that activists and relief workers were also being targeted by ISIS, according to the IBTimes. Nina told the publication that she had got the information from Aknaf Bait al-Maqdis, a Palestinian rebel group who are trying to recapture Yarmouk from ISIS. Thousands of Palestinians have been trying to escape Yarmouk since the area fell under ISIS control on April 4, leaving 200 people dead in seven days, including children who were slaughtered in front of their parents. Around 160,000 Palestinians used to live in Yarmouk, just a few miles from the palace of president Bashar Al-Assad, but many fled after his regime began bombing the neighbourhood in 2012 during the Arab Spring uprisings. The district was soon surrounded and food, water, and electricity supplies were all cut off, with around 18,000 residents still trapped inside. Around 18,000 Palestinians have been under siege in Yarmouk since 2012, before ISIS fighters moved in earlier this month. Since then thousands more have fled, while many who remained have been killed . Those who have managed to escape Yarmouk since ISIS captured it have told of militants playing football in the streets with severed heads, and children killed in front of their families . The plight of those in Yarmouk was brought to international attention in February last year when the United Nations Relief and Works Agency finally managed to bring much-needed aid to the area. Hundreds of civilians were pictured packing the bombed-out streets, desperately trying to get their hands on and food available. It was estimated that, before the UN workers arrived, the average resident of Yarmouk was living on 400 calories a day, less than a quarter of the daily recommended amount. It was reported at the time that some had taken to eating stray cats and dogs in desperation, all while being shelled and bombed by Assad's troops. Their situation became even more dire at the start of this month when ISIS stormed the camp. Around 2,500 people managed to flee before the assault took place, but many were left behind, trapped when ISIS posted snipers in the tallest buildings surrounding the southern neighbourhoods. The plight of those trapped in Yarmouk came to light in February last year when UN aid workers were allowed in after years of siege conditions, and hundreds flooded the streets in search of food . Since ISIS seized control of around 70 per cent of the Yarmouk Camp, tales of their barbarity have leaked out as other Palestinians managed to escape their clutches. Amjad Yaaqub, 16, said he found Islamic State troops playing football with the severed head of a Palestinian rebel fighter they had executed. The teenager said he stumbled upon the scene after being beaten unconscious by fanatics hunting for his brother, a resistance fighter. When he woke up he walked outside his home and found the gruesome scene taking place. Other residents have also told of the fighters' barbarity. Abdel Fatah, 55, said: 'I saw severed heads. They killed children in front of their parents. We were terrorised. 'We had heard of their cruelty from the television, but when we saw it ourselves... I can tell you, their reputation is well-deserved.'",

The so-called 'The Nation's Fist' not only wrote the song 'Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino' but also sang and directed the music video before releasing it on his Facebook page on Monday. The tune, which sounds somewhat like an 80s rock ballad actually translates as 'I will fight for the Fillipino' and will be played ahead of the richest fight in history against the undefeated American at the MGM Grand on May 2. Multi-talented Pacquiao not only wrote and sang the tune but also directed the music video . The video also carries a nostalgic feel, featuring a leather-clad Pacquiao crooning into the microphone Band-Aid style while a montage of his various fights and humanitarian efforts fade in and out. Whether Mayweather has called on his close friend and cheerleader Justin Bieber to come up with his own entrance song has not been confirmed. The boxing champion's song\u00a0'Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino' translates as\u00a0'I will fight for the Fillipino' The 80s style music video includes a montage of Pacquiao's fights and his humanitarian efforts . Meanwhile, the 36-year-old decided to train on the streets of Los Angeles on Friday as he ran along the trail at Griffith Park joined by\u00a0several fitness fanatics. As well as working on his aerobic endurance, Pacquiao was also tested on his core strength and showed off his impressive footwork in front of watching spectators by shadow boxing. Pacquiao recently unveiled the multicoloured mouth guard he will wear during his $300million Las Vegas showdown with Mayweather. The container that it comes in reads 'MouthGuards for Champions', demonstrating Pacquiao's undoubted confidence. Pacquiao was joined by his dog Pacman as he ran around one of North America's largest urban parks . Pacquiao has revealed the colourful mouthpiece he will wear during the May 2 bout in Las Vegas . I always ask in my mind why do we have to judge what you feel? What should be the right basis so they can listen to us? Do we have to be in a good status? Even if i hurt myself, i still wanted to keep it within me and just be silent about it. Even if my heart aches, its nothing to me as long as people from my country show their smiles and felt happy. I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy . I will fight the world with my life at stake. I will fight for all Filipino .

She was discovered at the Court Street property in Edgartown by owner Mark Conklin on April 17. Michelle Filkins, 44, of West Wareham has been charged with breaking and entering, larceny over $250, and the malicious destruction of property after she was arrested on April 17 . Filkins was arrested on April 17 after owner Mark Conklin found her sitting in his summer home . According to the police report, Conklin found Filkins sitting in his living room of the property estimated to be worth $800,000. When he confronted her she claimed that she owned the house. She then fled in a gray Nissan pickup truck when Conklin called the police at about 8 a.m. When police arrived, they discovered a large glass window to the left side of the front door had been broken and covered by a blanket, reports The Boston Globe. Filkins was arrested several hours later after she attempted to get back into the home thinking that Conklin had left. She is next scheduled to be in court on May 14. A construction worker in the neighborhood has told police that he saw Filkins outside with items from the home, and that she appeared to be having a yard sale or giving the items away. According to a post on the department's Facebook page, items missing include four deck chairs from Crate & Barrel, a Weber grill, two side tables from Ethan Allen, one Ann Chase lamp, two lamps from Crate & Barrel, two framed posters, various pots, pans, and linens, and a painting by the owner. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home to return them to the Edgartown police department. 'If in fact you did purchase something you are a victim as well and EPD will assist you in seeking restitution via the court prosecution of this case,' the police department said on Facebook. Anyone with information can also contact the police department at 508-627-4343. Police are asking anyone who received items from the home - including a lamp and a painting - to return them .",

Russia has key interests in . common with the United States and needs to work with it on a . common agenda, Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Saturday . in a television interview. In his comments to the state-run Rossiya channel, Putin . appeared to soften his anti-American rhetoric after being highly . critical. Relations between Moscow and Washington, and other . Western powers, have soured over the conflict in Russia's . neighbor Ukraine, sinking to an all-time low. 'We have disagreements on several issues on the . international agenda. 'But at the same time there is something . that unites us, that forces us to work together,' Putin said. 'I mean general efforts directed at making the world economy . more democratic, measured and balanced, so that the world order . is more democratic. 'We have a common agenda.' Putin has in the past fiercely attacked the United States . and the West in general, blaming them for the Ukraine crisis, . which Russia says was the result of a Western-backed 'coup' against Ukraine's former leader Viktor Yanukovich. Russia has repeatedly denied accusations from Kiev and the . West that it is supporting pro-Russian rebels with troops and . weapons in eastern Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have . been killed since last April. His latest remark comes two days after an annual TV phone-in . show in which Putin accused the United States of trying to . dominate world affairs, saying it wanted 'not allies, but . vassals'. On Saturday, Putin (pictured above with U.S. president Obama in November 2014 at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit) said the U.S. and Russia have a common agenda of general efforts directed at making the world economy more democratic, measured and balanced . During the Thursday interview, he also made it clear that Russia wants an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and is interested in rebuilding damaged ties with the United States and other Western nations. The U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia over Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and accusations of supporting separatists in Ukraine. At the same time, he reaffirmed his long-held criticism of what he sees as U.S. aspirations of global domination, saying Washington must learn to treat Russia as an equal partner. 'The main condition for restoring normal relations is to have respect for Russia and its interests,' Putin said on Thursday, adding that the United States 'doesn't need allies; they need vassals.' However, his criticisms of the West on Saturday were more moderate . than in some previous appearances.

The Labour leader admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language. But the Tories said there was nothing in Mr Miliband's plans to act to reduce the number of people moving to Britain, after net migration hit 298,000 in a year. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband\u00a0admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language . Mr Miliband pledged a new crackdown on illegal exploitation of migrant workers, promising a Home Office task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers. Speaking in Wirral West - a marginal seat held by the Tory Employment Minister Esther McVey - the Labour leader said exploitation drives low skilled migration and holds down wages for British workers. His new unit of 100 staff will bring together people from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and specialist police units, together with additional Home Office enforcement staff. The unit will be empowered to investigate abuse and be challenged to increase prosecutions and fines levelled against employers who break the rules. But he also warned that migrants must learn to speak English, especially in key services like the NHS. Mr Miliband said: 'Our communities are changing fast but we don't cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds. 'Instead we must find a way to live together across communities. 'A Britain where people of all backgrounds, all cultures, all religions, can practise their own faiths but also come together to forge a common identity. 'But we can only build this shared society if we speak the same language.' In his speech in Pensby, northern England, Mr Miliband insisted that there was an 'epidemic of exploitation' He said his own parents had learned to speak English after arriving from Belgium in 1940. 'It is why I believe in a simple principle: Everyone in Britain should know how to speak English. 'Sometimes, we've been too timid about this but it is something we should expect from everyone who comes here. 'And it is especially important that people who work in public services in public facing roles should be required to speak English.' He said that 'nowhere is that more true' than in the health service. 'We all know the crucial contribution that people from overseas play in our NHS. Doctors, paramedics, social workers, nurses. Bringing specialist skills that we need. 'I will never demean or devalue their contribution to our country. 'But it is vital that people who come to fulfil these roles don't just have the right medical skills, but can communicate with those for whom they care. 'So in the future all healthcare professionals will be required to speak English to a sufficient standard so they can care effectively for patients.' The Labour leader, pictured greeting staff and students at Pensby High School, also used the speech to promise Labour would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration . Mr Miliband told the audience how his 'parents came to Britain to flee the horrors of Nazi Germany'. He said: 'They found a country that welcomed them and offered them the opportunity to build a new life. To start a family. To work hard and make a contribution. 'I wouldn't be standing here today, asking you to elect me your Prime Minister, if it wasn't for the generosity of this great country. Conservative immigration minister James Brokenshire said nothing Ed Miliband is proposing would help control immigration . 'Where we are always stronger when we draw on the widest range of talents, perspectives and cultures. 'But I also know for that to happen, there have to be proper controls on immigration. We have got to have the right rules in place and with a Labour government we will.' He went on: 'I've been very clear about the mistakes the last Labour government made. 'We were wrong not to ensure there were maximum transitional controls when new countries joined the European Union in 2004. 'And the reason we were wrong is that working people were seeing dramatic changes in their communities that were not planned or properly prepared for. 'And we won't make that mistake in future.' Conservative immigration minister James Brokenshire said: 'Nothing Ed Miliband is proposing would help control immigration. Labour sent out 'search parties for people' and under them net migration increased more than five-fold. 'Since 2010, we have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students, cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages, made it harder for people to live in the UK illegally, and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop spurious attempts to remain in the country. 'And the next Conservative government will seek changes to the operation of European free movement rules as a key part of our plan to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU. 'But a vote for Ed Miliband would risk all of that with a Labour-SNP stitch up.'",

New Zealander Philip Lyle Hansen, 56, has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges, including unlawful sexual connection and charges of wounding with intent to injure four women\u00a0between 1988 and 2011. On Wednesday a Wellington District Court jury continued hearing evidence from a woman, 47, who was in a relationship with Hansen during the 1990s. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court she never consented to Hansen pulling out her teeth but was too \u2018afraid\u2019 to say anything. Crown prosecutor Sally Carter warned the jury that during the trial they would hear evidence about Hansen's \u2018fascination or obsession with them [women] not having any teeth\u2019. New Zealander Philip Lyle Hansen, 56, is accused of\u00a0removing women\u2019s teeth with pliers and a screwdriver during sex . \u2018He liked his women without teeth,\u2019 Ms Carter said in her opening address, the New Zealand Herald reports. The court watched a video form 2012 of the woman talking about how Hansen allegedly held her against a car door and removed six of her bottom teeth, using an oily rag to stop the bleeding, during sex. She later had all her teeth removed and replaced with dentures, but when her wisdom teeth started coming through Hansen allegedly removed them with a screwdriver. \u2018He had a screwdriver in his hand, he then tilted my head back... after that he had grabbed the screwdriver and started digging at the back of my gums to try and get out these wisdom teeth,\u2019 she said in the video. A woman, 47, has claimed Hansen 'grabbed the screwdriver and started digging at the back of my gums' During cross-examination defence lawyer Mike Antunovic said the woman had let Hansen pull out six teeth from her lower jaw and that Hansen was just trying to help the women, not hurt them. \u2018So after he pulled out the first tooth ... the second tooth, the third tooth, the fourth tooth, the fifth tooth, the sixth tooth ... you didn't ask him to stop?\u2019 said Mr Antunovic. \u2018No,\u2019 replied the woman, who said she had been drinking that night but was not heavily intoxicated. The lawyer said the woman had not objected to Hansen extracting her teeth with pliers. \u2018You opened your mouth to allow him to put the pliers in,\u2019 said Mr Antunovic. \u2018I would not just freely open my mouth to a pair of pliers,\u2019 said the woman. Hansen's lawyer\u00a0said the woman had not objected to Hansen extracting her teeth with pliers . \u2018Well, you didn't shut your mouth. You didn't tell him to stop,\u2019 said the lawyer. The woman told the court she couldn't, saying \u2018I had no choice\u2019. Mr Antunovic suggested Hansen had been trying to help the woman when he tried to remove her emerging wisdom teeth with a screwdriver after she complained about the problems they were causing her. \u2018Do you think Philip was trying to help you, in his own way?\u2019 he said. \u2018Not really, no,\u2019 said the woman. Hansen was arrested in December 2012. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Sandstorms caused havoc in Saudi Arabia last week with a number of flights being cancelled and schools being forced to close. Car crashes were also reported in other areas as parts of the Arabian Peninsula   were plunged into darkness. Strong winds are believed to have caused the disruption, which resulted in nearby Dubai\u2019s skyline almost disappearing and people suffering from respiratory problems. The footage, captured on camera in Saudi Arabia by Mohammed Mohsen, shows the sandstorm sweeping into the area in which he stands at a staggering speed. Like the aftermath of an explosion, the orange cloud engulfs the road and nearby buildings while it continues to move forward. Mohammed Mohsen captures the orange cloud getting thicker as it disperses and engulfs the road . The orange cloud gets thicker and drastically reduces visibility across the entire Arab state . Getting thicker, the cloud suddenly becomes darker and is it disperses further  sunlight becomes drastically reduced. A number of people stand alongside the video maker, staring in awe and filming the large cloud on their own camera phones. The video concludes with the filmmaker moving the camera around to show the sheer capacity of the cloud, which he is now very much encapsulated within. Mohammed Mohsen films the cloud above his head and captures the moment he becomes engulfed within it . Last week the storm filled Saudi Arabia\u2019s air before spreading across the peninsula into the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Yemen. Despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in this part of the world, they are not generally this big and rarely wreak so much havoc.

The NRL Judiciary Code of Procedure states that Contrary Conduct refers to 'the misconduct on the part of a Player constituted by behaving in a way that is contrary to the true spirit of the Game' while Detrimental Conduct means 'misconduct on the part of a Player constituted by behaving in a manner which is detrimental to the interests, welfare or image of the NRL'. Both Canterbury forwards could have these charges referred straight to the NRL judiciary, with the highest contrary conduct charge, a grade five, carrying a 525-demerit point penalty and a five-game ban. Graham's charges would relate to his argument with referee Gerard Sutton when he awarded Souths a penalty, after the Bulldogs captain's controversial tackle on Adam Reynolds. Klemmer meanwhile was sin-binned after crowding in on Sutton alongside Graham and yelling 'You're off your f****ing face,' at the lead referee. NRL head of football Todd Greenberg revealed that the match review committee would 'look very closely at' their behaviour, noting that contrary conduct and detrimental conduct requirements will 'form part of the review' 'I don't want to talk specifically about the incidents because they will form part of our match committee review but, in general terms, the behaviour of players on the field is something we will look very closely at,' Greenberg said on Saturday on Triple M. 'Swearing at match officials is not acceptable and I put a full stop on that sentence, because it is really not acceptable. 'I know our match review (committee) will look closely at those incidents. 'There are requirements under the code, things like contrary conduct and detrimental conduct which will all form part of that review and, if there are penalties that need to be imposed, I expect the match review (committee) will discharge their duties accordingly.' It comes as the NRL announced they are determined to come down hard on a worrying trend of increasing dissent towards match officials after a violent end to Friday's game when spectators threw bottles at match officials . The NRL match review committee will be headed up by Michael Buettner along with Brad Clyde, Michael Hodgson and Peter Louis. The NRL introduced new measures last season as to how and when captains could talk to referees. Former Bulldogs chief executive Greenberg again indicated that these would be monitored closely. 'James is the captain so he has the right to talk to him (Sutton) at certain parts during the game, but there were episodes in last night's game that caused me some concern,' Greenberg said. 'And that will form part of the review but it goes to a broader point - match officials need to be held with a much greater level of respect within the game.' Bulldogs CEO\u00a0Raelene Castle checks on the NRL interchange official who was injured at the end of game.\u00a0Darren Alchin was taken to hospital with a broken shoulder blade after slipping over in an attempt to avoid a bottle thrown from the stands . Bulldogs fans react towards the match officials at full time  at ANZ Stadium on Friday night in Sydney . Bulldogs fullback Brett Morris will also come under scrutiny from the match review committee after being placed on report for appearing to kick Souths hooker Issac Luke in the head as he scored a try just before halftime at ANZ Stadium. It comes as the NRL announced they are determined to come down hard on a worrying trend of increasing dissent towards match officials after a violent end to Friday's game when spectators threw bottles at the referees. 'The behaviour of players on the field is something we will look very closely at,' Greenberg said on Saturday . Officials had to run from the field for cover and sideline interchange official Darren Alchin was later taken to hospital with a broken shoulder blade after slipping over in an attempt to avoid a bottle thrown from the stands. A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that two people had been identified and their details taken down over the incident, however no charges have been laid. Officers are continuing with their inquiries and are yet to identify how many people were involved in incident. Those found responsible are facing a life time ban from the NRL. Two other men were charged with assault in unrelated incidents following the game, including a 22-year-old male who pushed a young relative to the ground, causing him to hit his face. 'The boy received minor facial injuries and did not require medical treatment. The relative was charged with common assault (domestic related) and given strict bail conditions to appear at Burwood Local Court,' a police statement read. A 38-year-old man was also charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm after knocking down a 21-year-old man outside the stadium. The injured man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital by paramedics where he was treated for a cut above his eye and his aggressor will appear at Burwood Local Court in April.",

Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles, has documented her changing figure via her Instagram\u00a0page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the mother-to-be came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against her unusually trim and toned figure, claiming it could be doing damage to her unborn child, their comments haven't stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.5 million Instagram followers. Scroll down for video . So soon: Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she is supposed to give birth to her son . Feeling sexy: The 30-year-old mom-to-be celebrated being 38 weeks pregnant by sharing this photo of herself in a gold lam\u00e9\u00a0bikini . Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram on Monday to share a photo of growing belly during her ninth month of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' The snapshot of herself in a bra and thong underwear has been liked nearly 45,000 times since it was posed and has earned nearly 5,000 comments. Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage\u00a0#amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. Baby boy: After posting this bikini photo on Instagram in March, she noted her son is 'growing so much' Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Proud of her bump: Sarah struck various photos for these selfies of herself in her underwear . 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to pregnant Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people noted her son must be as tiny as she is. Bump to bump: Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Just like dad: Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. And when she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the expecting mom has been posting pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. On Wednesday Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refuses to hide her eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Stylish mom: Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Looking good: Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant . She shuns baggy dresses and instead dresses her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah has continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'",

Fading champions City had to watch in frustration on Saturday, not only as Chelsea extended their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League, but as Arsenal and Manchester United shunted them down to fourth. Slipping to such a position was not in the script when City pulled level with Chelsea on New Year's Day and any further slips would increase the pressure on Pellegrini significantly. Manuel Pellegrini has warned his side must overcome a difficult obstacle at Crystal Palace . Manchester City manager Pellegrini does not want his side to lose any more ground in the race for the title . With the Manchester derby coming next week, City can ill afford to drop points at Selhurst Park on Monday but Pellegrini knows the Eagles have become a tough proposition under Alan Pardew. Pellegrini said: 'Maybe they are playing different. They are in a good moment and they are playing with a lot of trust. 'With the other manager also Crystal Palace was a difficult team, but now they are playing at home.' City laboured to a 3-0 win over Palace at the Etihad Stadium in December in what proved Neil Warnock's penultimate match in charge. Pardew was appointed early in the new year and since then they have proved highly resilient, losing just three times in the Premier League and removing relegation fears. The Monday fixture has meant both sides have had to be patient for their return to action after the international break. It is a wait that could have been advantageous in terms of extra rest had their rivals lost over the weekend. Manchester City players celebrate scoring against West Bromwich Albion in their last match . Pellegrini knows hisside can ill afford to fall further behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race . Pellegrini (left) will try to close the gap between his team and Chelsea at the top of the Premier League . It has not turned out that way with Saturday's positive results for Chelsea, Arsenal and United turning the heat up on City, but Pellegrini claims it does not make any difference. The Chilean said: 'I don't think we have excuses about those things. We are going to play the last game of this matchday but that doesn't matter. 'It is not an excuse and not an advantage. All the national players arrived back on Wednesday - most of them - so every team had three or four days to prepare. It is not so important.' Should Pablo Zabaleta feature for City it would come just two days after his wife gave birth to a son, Asier.

But high street retailers are boosting their fortunes \u2013 by scrapping them. Debenhams and Mothercare have called a halt to long-running promotions which fail to excite shoppers, replacing them with shorter events that have more impact. And both have announced revived figures since making the change. Experts claim prolonged sales can devalue products and encourage shoppers to delay buying an item until it is reduced. High street chains, including Mothercare, are calling time on cut-price promotions that seem to go on forever . Figures show a third of all fashion purchases are now made in a sale or promotion, and there have been warnings that shoppers are being \u2018trained\u2019 not to buy at full price, undermining profits. In the past, retail analysts mocked Debenhams for being \u2018Never Knowingly Not On Sale\u2019 \u2013 a pun on the John Lewis slogan \u2018Never Knowingly Undersold\u2019. Now, the department store has reduced its endless blue cross sales and promotions, which it admitted sometimes \u2018create noise but don\u2019t create value\u2019. Debenhams said that despite fewer sale events, feedback suggests customers now think the store is actually better value. The move follows similar cuts to the number of supermarket promotions. Sainsbury\u2019s recently dropped some of its popular offers \u2013 including three for \u00a310 on some meat and fish products \u2013 in favour of lower prices on more everyday items. In the past year, Debenhams has held 39 fewer sale days, meaning it spent a month less in a promotional period. It has also put more emphasis on ensuring pre-sale garments are \u2018better value\u2019 and that the \u2018first price is the right price\u2019, cutting the cost of some menswear, womenswear and home goods. Debenhams said despite fewer sale events, feedback suggests customers now think the store is better value . Chief executive Michael Sharp said: \u2018It\u2019s not about ending promotions, but being more focused and removing events that create noise but don\u2019t create value.\u2019 Mothercare also expressed a desire last year to return to being a \u2018full price retailer\u2019. Chief executive Mark Newton Jones said this week: \u2018In the UK, our strategy of reducing promotional and discount activity and returning to be a full price retailer has continued to stabilise margin.\u2019 Its latest Christmas period sales lasted three weeks instead of an incredible eight weeks in 2013-14. Diane Wehrle, of retail analysts Springboard, said: \u2018There is a strong argument that the more sales you hold, the more you have to hold. Consumers get used to the store always being in sale and hold out from shopping there until the next one.\u2019 Neil Saunders, of retail analysts Conlumino, added: \u2018The model of continual discounting is damaging for a retailer, not least because it erodes margins and dissuades shoppers from purchasing at full price. \u2018It\u2019s like a drug \u2013 the more a retailer does it, the more they have to keep doing it to generate a sales hit. \u2018In some ways, unless it is part of a specific business model, constant discounting is a sign of failure.\u2019",

Having been linked with a string of the world's most famous beauties - Angelina Jolie, Demi Moore, Britney Spears, Elizabeth Taylor - the actor says he's now hung up his prowling boots. In fact, the 38-year-old has confessed in an interview with The Sunday Times\u00a0that not only is he too busy, but he's not even interested in the chase any longer. Scroll down for video . Colin Farrell has claimed that he's no longer the womaniser we once knew, and hasn't dated in four years . The 38-year-old actor says that he's now focusing on resurrecting his acting career (pictured here in the upcoming second series of True Detective) and being a good father to his two sons James and Henry . What's occupying so much time for the man who was once nicknamed the 'Lusty Leprechaun'? The Irish actor is about to experience something of a comeback with a role in the much-anticipated second series of HBO's True Detective. He's also the face of the new Dolce & Gabbana fragrance Intenso. However he insists that his time now is dedicated to clean living and seeing his two sons James Padraig, 11, and Henry Tadeusz, five. It's a far more wholesome lifestyle for Colin who confesses he's glad that his drink and drug-fuelled days are behind him. He's now branded his arrival in Hollywood circa 2002 as 'too much' to handle in his early 20s, and he's now not only completely sober - he even enjoys a spot of yoga. Britney Spears accompanied Colin Farrell to the premiere of film The Recruit during the height of his party-hard lifestyle. The pair both denied any romance however, claiming they were 'just mates' And his love life is firmly on the backburner. Asked if he had any women his life, he replied: 'There is not one - zilch, nada.' Even more surprising however, is that after years of being labelled a womaniser, his now celibate - and happy with his unattached status. 'I have not dated for, ooh, four years now. It's just not happening, what with the work, the kids and my life. 'I know it's not what people expect to hear, but that's the honest truth.' The actor is now a devoted dad and although they live with their mothers (James with model Kim Bordenave and Henry with ex-wife Alicja Bachleda-Curus) he sees the boys every weekend. He told the Sunday Times's Style magazine:\u00a0'It's not all about you any more, which is a relief. It's about a bigger world, and helping them find their place in it. 'It's not about \u00a0\"me, me, me, the loudmouth\" any more - and that takes the pressure off me to live up to those old expectations'. He is especially protective of James, who has a developmental disorder called Angelman syndrome, which causes intellectual and physical disability. On the set of film Alexander, Colin Farrell was reported to have had flirtations with Angelina Jolie . Left: Colin married actress Amelia Warner, now married to Fifty Shades star Jamie Dornan,\u00a0in 2001 in a ceremony in Tahiti though the marriage wasn't legal; Right: He was also rumoured to have dated Demi Moore . Colin certainly has a colourful dating CV having been linked to a Who's Who of actresses, models and movie icons. He and Jamie Dornan's wife Amelia Warner 'married' in a non-legally binding ceremony in Tahiti in 2001, the following year he dated Canadian model Kim, and conceived their child James. By the next year he was linked with Demi Moore, although they've both denied the affair and in 2003, Britney Spears accompanied him to the premiere of his film The Recruit but any intimate acquaintance didn't last with Colin insisting they were 'just mates'. Angelina Jolie is rumoured to have come on to him during the filming of Alexander in 2003, and he is said to have offered to read Dame Eileen Atkins, who was then 70, a book in bed. She refused. After Elizabeth Taylor's death in 2011 Colin admitted to being 'romantically' involved with the actress . Doting daddy: Colin Farrell has spoken in the past about how he has learnt to cope with his eleven-year-old son James' condition - Angelman Syndrome, a neuro-genetic disorder which can affect brain development . In 2006 the womaniser was enmeshed in legal proceedings over a leaked sex tape during a brief relationship with former Playboy model Nicole Narain. And three years later he met Alicja on the set of Ondine. They had baby Henry together in 2010 bu split up soon after. The Minority Report star's most bizarre liaison, however, was with Elizabeth Taylor in the last years of her life. He called her 'a spectacular woman' and described the relationship as 'romantic' and when she died in 2011, he read a poem at her funeral. Colin Farrell was briefly married to Ondine co-star Alicja Bachleda-Curu\u015b, the mother of his five-year-old son . Colin is now a self-declared family man, pictured here collecting his five-year-old son Henry from school .",

The Barclays Premier League champions have seen their title defence left in tatters following a run of four defeats in six matches, thrashed 4-2 at rivals United last weekend - a result which left the long-term future of manager Pellegrini in doubt as City might now face a scrap with Liverpool for a Champions League qualifying spot. West Ham are also in need a pick-me-up, having seen victory slip through their fingers when Stoke netted a stoppage time equaliser at Upton Park. West Ham midfielder\u00a0Cheikhou Kouyate is wary of facing champions Manchester City on Sunday . City midfielder Yaya Toure (centre) and his team-mates suffered a 4-2 defeat at Old Trafford last week . Senegal midfielder Kouyate expects City to produce a response, but also one from Sam Allardyce's squad, who have failed to find consistency over the second half of the season to drop out of contention for the European places. 'Anything is possible in football, but we mustn't forget who we are up against. They are a wounded animal, because they need points, so they have to wake themselves up to win,' Kouyate said on the club's official website, www.whufc.com. 'We need the points as well, because we want to remain in the top 10. 'It is not going to be easy because we will be up against one of the best teams in the country and last year's champions of England. 'If we are going to get anything there, we have to enjoy it and really play as a team and work as a team.' Kouyate celebrates with left back Aaron Cresswell after his goal against Stoke at Upton Park last Saturday . Marouane Fellaini (right) scores United's second goal as City fell to another Premier League defeat . Kouyate added: 'A team like Manchester City can't afford to make mistakes, so for us it's a good time to face them, but we mustn't underestimate them, there's life in them yet.' West Ham look short of options in attack. Striker Enner Valencia is being assessed for a foot injury picked up on his return to action against Stoke, while Diafra Sakho, who has netted 12 goals in all competitions, is facing a battle to play again this season following a thigh strain. Allardyce is hoping his team can produce the required level of concentration to accommodate their forward losses. He said: 'That leaves us very short on the front line with Andy (Carroll) being out, and means goals will be fewer and farther between than they used to be, so if we don't get that defensive side right then the last six games are going to be tough for us.'",

At the hearing, the judge granted Robert Bates permission to go to the Bahamas for a family vacation. That decision prompted a response from the family of Eric Harris, the man Bates killed. \"We are not surprised that Mr. Bates pled not guilty.  We are, however, surprised that Mr. Bates would choose to go on a vacation to the Bahamas during this tumultuous time.  Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life.  At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.\" Bates' preliminary hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. July 2. \"This will give us an opportunity to deal with the facts in the courtroom instead of the media and we're looking very much forward to that,\" said  Clark Brewster, one of his lawyers, after the hearing. Bates, 73, was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Eric Harris in a weapons sting operation. Bates claims he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after Harris fled from officers, but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff. The Tulsa World newspaper reported some supervisors in the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office were told to forge Bates' records and were reassigned when they refused. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office has denied these allegations. Over the weekend, one of Bates' lawyers released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training. Two deputies involved in arrest of Harris have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Glanz said Monday in a news conference.

Scroll down for video . Up close: Would-be MP Maajid Nawaz with a scantily-clad lap dancer in the club in east London . Seedy: The married father-of-one asked for two private sessions at a strip club in east London . Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been \u2018outrageous\u2019. In the film, Nawaz \u2013 a convicted former extremist \u2013 can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him in a private room during two \u00a320 lap dances. Manager Jay Shah, who witnessed Nawaz\u2019s behaviour, said he was \u2018very drunk\u2019 and bouncers threatened to throw him out several times. \u2018He was asking her to touch him and he was touching her,\u2019 he said. \u2018In general he was quite persistent with her, asking to take her out and for her number.\u2019 A rising star of the Liberal Democrats, 37-year-old Nawaz is also a leading figure in the Muslim community and head of anti-extremism charity the Quilliam Foundation, which he set up. Rising star: The prospective parliamentary candidate with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . A regular guest on BBC News programmes, he declared on Newsnight in 2013: \u2018I consider myself a feminist.\u2019 He once wrote on Twitter: \u2018You don\u2019t need to be a woman to stand for women\u2019s rights.\u2019 He often throws his weight behind gender issues such as the campaign against female genital mutilation and paints himself as a role model for young Muslim men at risk of radicalisation. But Abdul Malik, the club\u2019s owner, said he wanted the video to be seen by the public because of the way Nawaz portrays himself as a feminist and a family man. \u2018He\u2019s always talking about religion on TV and I thought, what a hypocrite,\u2019 he said. He claimed \u2018arrogant\u2019 Nawaz acts like a \u2018spokesman for Islam\u2019 \u2013 but visited the club during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Staff said Nawaz had been pestering the girl all night and his actions had been \u2018outrageous\u2019 The full strip club footage, obtained by the Mail, clearly shows Nawaz receiving two five-minute lap dances an hour apart. He and two friends paid \u00a310 entry to the small \u2018gentleman\u2019s club\u2019 in Whitechapel and were seen drinking heavily. He left the club alone in the early hours of the morning. During the first session \u2013 in which the dancer gets naked \u2013 she has to repeatedly remove his hands from her body and pushes him away at one point. During the second dance with the same woman, he also spends time chatting to her \u2013 whispering into her ear and trying to touch her hair. Newlywed: Nawaz's second wife Rachel Maggart . She later informed the manager, who told security to \u2018keep an eye on her\u2019. Club boss Mr Shah claimed Nawaz had been \u2018bragging\u2019 but the dancer later told him: \u2018Who does he think he is?\u2019 Tory MP Nadine Dorries last night called for Nawaz to quit his candidacy. \u2018In politics, you can\u2019t advocate one cause or manner of behaviour then act differently in your personal life,\u2019 she said. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood added: \u2018The message this sends to women is not one of respect.\u2019 British-born Nawaz was jailed in Egypt in 2005 for his role in radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. On his return to England in 2006, he renounced his views and quickly established himself as a spokesman on extremism issues. He has been selected by party leader Nick Clegg to fight the London marginal seat of Hampstead and Kilburn and has been married to US-born writer and artist Rachel Maggart, 29, since October. They were engaged and believed to have been living together at his West London home when he visited the club on July 9 last year. He has a young son from his previous marriage to Rabia Nawaz \u2013 who is also known to have supported Hizb ut-Tahrir. A spokesman for Nawaz said he denied touching the dancer \u2018inappropriately\u2019 and added that his reputation for advocating women\u2019s rights was \u2018in the context of Islamic extremism\u2019. He said he had not been warned about his behaviour, and was not \u2018out of control\u2019 through drink or breaching the rules. The spokesman said: \u2018The evening you refer to was our client\u2019s stag night before his marriage. \u2018His best man took him to the gentleman\u2019s club with the full knowledge of our client\u2019s then future wife (now his wife).\u2019 Nawaz can be seen repeatedly trying to make contact with the girl as she dances naked for him .",

Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to stay with the 96-year-old former prisoner of war, despite the fact that Mr Clark spent his \u00a350,000 life savings on contributing to his care. Now, the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Help for Heroes has given Robbie Clark, pictured, an emergency grant so he can remain at home in London . The JustGiving paged more than half of the \u00a35,000 target within a couple of hours of it going live this morning . However, Help for Heroes has launched its own JustGiving page to help Mr Clark. The charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future. They have so far raised \u00a32,736.22 of the \u00a35,000 needed. Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance. Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country. 'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again. 'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.' Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war \u00a0- and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund. Having spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'. Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war. A total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said. More than \u00a32,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page. Mr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the \u2018death march\u2019 in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain\u2019s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. For the past two years he has used his \u00a350,000 savings to pay towards a \u00a3960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed \u00a3350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: \u2018This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. \u2018He\u2019s as good as told me that if he has to move, he\u2019ll just give up on life. Whenever he\u2019s been in hospital, he \u2026 pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. \u2018He hates being anywhere which isn\u2019t familiar \u2026 going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.\u2019 Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council\u2019s Phil Porter said: \u2018We recognise Mr Clark\u2019s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people \u2026 are in. \u2018However \u2026 the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.\u2019 He added: \u2018Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.\u2019 The council said Mr Clark\u2019s needs can be met in a care home for \u00a3451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: \u2018We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.\u2019 He added that the council had offered \u2018a deferred payment which means he doesn\u2019t need to sell his house to pay for his care\u2019. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark\u2019s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.",

Another hurdle on their way to the Premier League has been negotiated as they secured a hard-fought win over Reading. This was tense, though. Manager Eddie Howe would testify to that. But winning a place in the top-flight has never been easy; Bournemouth are finding exactly that out. Callum Wilson celebrates after opening the scoring for Bournemouth in the fourth minute . Wilson opens the scoring for Bournemouth early on against Reading at the Madejski Stadium .

But, as of yet, the Cherries aren't choking, Callum Wilson's 22nd goal of the season setting them on their way to a third successive win at the Madejski Stadium. Howe said: \u2018It was nervy, with what\u2019s at stake it was always going to be that way. We defended for our lives and showed incredible mental strength. It was a different kind of win than we\u2019re used to, but results are the most important things now. \u2018I\u2019d much rather we were playing total football and doing what we\u2019ve done all season, but we are finding a new way to win and I\u2019ll take that at this stage.\u2019 There was no doubt over which team needed the three points more. This victory secured Bournemouth's position in the top-six, meaning - at the very least - that they'll have a crack at promotion via the play-offs. Reading, under Steve Clarke, have all but secured their Championship status, and with an FA Cup semi-final date at Wembley against Arsenal on the horizon the Royals, perhaps, had other matters on their mind. And so it proved as the Cherries took a fourth minute lead when Wilson fired home from close range after Andrew Surman's shot from the edge of the area struck Adam Federici's far post. It was exactly the start Howe wanted as they looked to maintain their position at the Championship summit. But the visitors had goalkeeper Artur Boruc to thank in the 17th minute as he produced an outstanding one-handed save to deny Jamie Mackie's close range effort from Jordan Obita's cross. And Nathaniel Chalobah, Hal Robson-Kanu and Obita all waste good opportunities to level for the Royals as they mustered a promising response to going behind. These were worrying moments for Howe, who paced regularly from the dugout to his technical area to holler instructions at his players. And despite Yann Kermogrant sending a towering header from Marc Pugh's cross narrowly wide during the dying seconds of the first-half, Bournemouth's early mojo had vanished. Bournemouth's Simon Francis (left) on the run with Nathaniel Cahalobah in hot pursuit . Players appeal to referee Keith Stroud (right) as Wilson lies injured on the ground . Howe would have been happy to get his players in at half-time; his side, in truth, were starting to rock. That's what pressure does to a team. In fairness to the Cherries, though, not once did they part with the passing principles that have put them on the brink of automatic promotion. And the south-coast club looked to have regained their composure during the opening exchanges of the second half. Though, goalscorer Wilson was booked for diving in the 55th minute as the striker took the necessity for points too far. Yet, despite his side's improvement, Howe looked far from comfortable in his technical area. And Bournemouth were struggling to create the opportunities that would have calmed their manager's obvious nerves. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe (centre) and his players applaud the travelling support . There were nervy moments for the travelling Bournemouth fans as the end of the match approached . One mistake, one moment of magic from a Reading player and this match would have been back in the balance. Not only the match, but his side's chances of automatic promotion. Matt Richie went within inches of providing Howe and his team the cushion that they desperately craved in the 63rd minute. The Royals defence made a mockery of trying to clear a Bournemouth throw deep inside their half, the ball eventually fell to Richie who let fly with a curling left-footed effort that skimmed the top of Federici's far post. Steve Cook then saw his half-volley from the edge of the area held by Federici as the visitors started to turn the screw. Wilson (bottom) is challenged by Reading's Alex Pearce during the Championship clash . Reading manager Steve Clarke gestures to his players but the hosts could not find a way back . But Reading refused to lie down, and had Danny Williams not miskicked in the final six minutes then the hosts could easily have pulled level. Wilson missed a glorious chance to seal victory for Bournemouth in the 87th minute, but his control let him down at the vital moment. And the visitors had endure some terrifying moments as Reading laid siege to the Cherries goal. But Howe's side held on for another vital victory as their promotion bandwagon rolls on... just.",

Cheryl Heineman, 45, from St Cloud, was arrested Wednesday at Central Avenue Elementary School in Kissimmee on multiple counts of sale and delivery of narcotics. The woman's suspected accomplice and lover, 20-year-old Jack Lindsey, is facing the same charges. Scroll down for video . Breaking Bad: Cheryl Heineman (left), 45, a third-grade teacher from Florida, is accused of selling narcotics to an undercover officer with her 20-year-old lover, Jack Lindsey (right) Hauled off to jail: Heineman was arrested Wednesday outside Central Avenue Elementary School in Kissimmee, where she's worked since 2005 . The arrests came at the conclusion of a six-week investigation that was launched in early March after an informant tipped off police that Lindsey has been known to deal drugs. According to a 26-page arrest affidavit, an undercover detective contacted Lindsey late last month asking to purchase acid and Xanax. The officer stated that he had bought various controlled substances - Xanax, hydrocodone, tramadol, oxycodone, ecstasy and methamphetamine - from the suspect on three previous occasions. Investigators believe that Heineman, who is married and has three sons, had a romantic relationship with Lindsey and would act as his driver on drug deals, reported WKMG. Lindsey arranged a meeting March 25 with the undercover officer acting as a buyer in the parking lot of the Tractor Supply store on 13th Street in St Cloud, telling him that 'his girl' would deliver the product. Partners in crime: According to police, Lindsey set up a drug deal last month, telling an undercover cop acting as a buyer that 'his girl,' Heineman will deliver the pills . Nondescript location: The rendezvous between the officer and Heineman took place last month in the parking lot of the Tractor Supply store . Evidence: Heineman allegedly handed the officer three Xanax pills and acid tabs in exchange for $100 in cash . At the agreed upon time, a woman later identified as Cheryl Heineman pulled up in her minivan and handed the officer three Xanax pills and acid tabs in exchange for $100 in cash, according to the affidavit. Like with all the previous drug transactions, police videotaped and recorded the audio of Heineman\u2019s encounter with the cop. Heineman then left, but police took down her license plate number and were able to identify her. The woman was apprehended by police at Central Avenue Elementary at the end of the school day Wednesday and charged with a slew of counts of sale and delivery of Schedule IV narcotics; sale and delivery of a controlled substance; conspiracy, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Wife and mother: Heineman is married (pictured here with her husband) and has three sons . Booted out: The veteran educator, who has been working for the Osceola County school system since 1990, will be reassigned out of the classroom . The local station WFTV reported that she was taken to the Osceola County Jail on $28,000 bail. Lindsey is being held on $48,000 bail. Cheryl Heineman has been working at the Osceola County School District since 1990 in various capacities, including as a teacher at the Kissimmee school for the past nine years, reported WESH-TV. District officials said the third-grade teacher will be reassigned out of the classroom to a post where she will have no contact with children pending the outcome of the investigation.",

First it was Britney and Christina, and now rapper Drake has been on the receiving end of a little lip action from Madge. While the blondes had fun with it, Drake appeared less than enthused after Madonna's prolonged smooch onstage at the Coachella music festival in California on Sunday. In an update Monday from \"champagnepapi\" himself on Instagram, the rapper clarified his reaction: \"Don't misinterpret my shock!! I got to make out with the queen Madonna and I feel 100 about that forever. Thank you @Madonna.\" After the kiss, though, he seemed dazed. \"Oh, s***. What the f*** just happened?\" he asked moments later from the stage. It all went down after Drake performed  \"Madonna,\" a song named for the megastar off his new mixtape \"If You're Reading This It's Too Late,\" according to Billboard. He welcomed Madonna onstage as a special guest to perform a few songs. While wrapping up \"Human Nature,\" the Material Girl, 56, planted one on the seated Drake, 28, who began to flail his arms after a while in an apparent attempt to escape. His sour face after the encounter led many to speculate that he didn't enjoy the kiss. Of course, Drake and Madonna's little makeout sesh got the web talking and meme-ing: . \"So @Drake proves that kissing @Madonna is about as ghastly as I always imagined it would be,\" wrote former CNN personality Piers Morgan. \"Grandma: give Nana some suga .

After finding the alligator being attacked by a bird, Kevin Gill, from Naples, Florida, told WBBH that he thought his 13-year-old son could care for the reptile while learning about gators. But when Collier County deputies were serving a search warrant on the family's home for an unrelated issue, they came across the baby gator - and told Gill it was illegal. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Kevin Gill, pictured in a mug shot, left, was arrested after deputies found he had a small alligator inside his Florida home.

'I didn't think it was a big deal since there's millions of them and they took them off the endangered species list.' But after the deputies found the gator, which the family kept in a tank, they took Gill to jail. The case is being handled by Florida's Fish and Wildlife Commission.

Jon Huxley, 46, hopes to cash in on the Fifty Shades of Grey effect and attract guests from the gay and swinging communities at his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent. He plans to install sex swings, bondage rooms and dungeons and have rooms of differing sizes to cater for couples and multiple groups. Jon Huxley, standing outside his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent, is looking at 'developing' his premises to cater for swingers . He hopes the craze in Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his object of affection Anastasia Steele, can help transform his business. He said: 'We have plans to attract tourists from the gay and swinging community for short breaks and weekends of adult fun. 'Obviously a lot of equipment will need to be installed like swings, bondage rooms, red room of pain and dungeons of delight. 'We would be having these events each weekend and accepting tourist guests during the week. 'Food and drink will be provided as part of an all-inclusive hotel package and it would be a civilised and friendly environment.' Mr Huxley will be hoping to recreate scenes like this from the hit film Fifty Shades of Grey . Clothing will be optional and privacy for our guests will therefore need to be ensured. 'It is not intended to be a seedy or dirty business. It is a respected clientele who enjoy taking their clothes off.' Mr Huxley said he has decided to appeal to the swinging community after rowing with the council over the use of Grade-II listed building. Jon Huxley hopes the change in hotel ethos can see his business grow . For months he had been in a dispute with Shepway District Council over complaints about its use as a house of multiple occupation for homeless people. Councillors voted for an enforcement notice after neighbours complained of anti-social behaviour. Mr Huxley said the complaints had been about anti-social behaviour and noise from the street rather than from inside the property. He said he would not need a council entertainments licence because there would be no live entertainment, loud music or dancing. Asked what locals might think of his plans he said: 'I do not involve myself in what happens behind their closed doors and they should not involve themselves in what happens behind mine. 'I have bills to pay and the income has to come from somewhere. They have seen fit to take away my current source of guests so I have to look for other sources. 'I can't attract tourists because there isn't a market for it anymore and that is a fact I have to deal with. 'This is a growing market and I can't think of any other market that is growing at the rate of this one. 'Fifty Shades of Grey has been a phenomenal success and this is a sleeping giant in terms of the opportunities that are there.' Mr Huxley, who has owned the hotel for 13 years, said the special weekends would be controlled through advance bookings rather than being open to casual callers. They would be advertised predominantly through the internet or word of mouth with some advertising in 'appropriate places'. A spokesperson for Shepway District Council told MailOnline Travel: 'We would expect the owner to contact the council to discuss any licensing requirements, and to obtain listed building consent for internal works. 'The premises has currently got planning permission to be used as a hotel but does not hold a premises licence to sell alcohol. 'Anything the owner wishes to use it for outside permitted use may well require planning permission or new licences.' Mr Huxley hopes to install\u00a0swings, bondage rooms, red room of pain and dungeons of delight (film still from Fifty Shades of Grey) It is unknown what the residents in Folkestone, Kent, will make of Mr Huxley's plans .",

The team added energy-efficient LED rope lights to replicate the old tubes of neon lighting. Non-historic contemporary service bay roll-up doors were replaced with aluminum frame garage doors in the style of the period to form an exterior wall. Mr Alpert added: 'We didn't try to over-brand the building; we tried to keep it true to the original with only limited signage.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe families of five Chinese feminists detained by police for more than a month facing charges of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' have issued a plea to authorities for their release. The female activists were arrested the weekend before International Women's Day, as they were preparing to hand out leaflets about sexual harassment on public transport. The five women - Li Tingting, 25, Wei Tingting, 26, Wang Man, 32, Zheng Churan, 25, and Wu Rongrong, 30 - have been linked to several stunts over the last few years which aim to highlight issues such as domestic violence and the poor provision of women's toilets in China. The Chinese feminist activists (all pictured) have been detained by police for more than a month and face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged with 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' They now face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged. Prosecutors will announce later today whether the women should be formally arrested, released or have their cases sent back to the police, their lawyers said. The vague charge of 'provoking trouble' has been increasingly used by Chinese police under President Xi Jinping to detain and jail protesters from holding small-scale demonstrations. The activists were described as 'young, kind-hearted, and full of a sense of responsibility to society,' ten of their parents and spouses wrote in a letter to Beijing prosecutors which was posted online on Saturday. 'These five girls, who we care for and love deeply, have not made a mistake, let alone committed a crime,' they said, adding 'they have all striven to uphold our nation's basic policy of gender equality'. Activist Li Tingting, 25, (pictured) poses with letters protesting about the poor provision of female toilets - she and others have since been arrested . 'Supporting gender equality and the interests of women is no crime!' Their detention on March 8 has prompted renewed condemnation of China's tight controls on political activists from human rights groups as well as the US. Police interrogations of the women - several of whom suffer from chronic health problems such as asthma and an unspecified heart condition -have focused on a 2012 stunt named 'Occupy Men's Rooms', one of their lawyers, Liang Xiaojun, told AFP on Sunday. Prosecutors have until Monday to formally approve their arrest or police will be obliged to release the women, he added. The parents said in their letter that the women 'have been detained for over a month and we have not had a decent explanation'. 'Please restore their freedom and dignity as soon as possible!' they added. Meanwhile China has lodged a formal . protest with Washington after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and . Secretary of State John Kerry called for the release of the activists, the foreign ministry said on Monday. The tussle over the activists could further strain ties . between China and the United States, which frequently grapple . over everything the value of the yuan currency to China's . growing military assertiveness. Biden tweeted on Saturday that China should release them, . saying, 'We urge Chinese leaders to show respect for women's . rights,' and adding, 'Rights of women and girls should never be . suppressed.' Activtsts Wei Tingting, 26, (left) Wang Man, 32, (right) face charges of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' In a statement on Friday, Kerry said the U.S. government . backed the efforts of the activists, saying, 'We believe that . Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them.' China has lodged 'representations' with the United States . over the comments, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. 'We urge the United States to respect China's judicial . sovereignty and not use any pretext to interfere in China's . internal affairs,' he told a daily news briefing. 'China is a country of rule of law,' Hong added. 'China's . legal authorities will handle this case in accordance with the . law.' Hillary Clinton, the Democrats' 2016 presidential . front-runner, annoyed Beijing last week with similar calls to . free the women. Britain and the European Union have also . expressed concern about the case. President Xi Jinping's administration has detained hundreds . of activists in the past two years, in what some rights groups . say is the worst suppression of human rights in two decades. Activists say the women's cases have become a measure of . Beijing's resolve in crushing all forms of civil society. Zheng Churan, 25, (left) and Wu Rongrong, 30 (right) face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged .",
