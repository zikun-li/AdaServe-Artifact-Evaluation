Crime scene: The deadly incident took place inside the family's home in Katy, texas, Tuesday night when Ulysses Beaudoin arrived with his girlfriend in tow . Beaudoin had pulled up to the house in his Ford SUV and went inside. His girlfriend, who has not been named, remained in her own car around the corner. Moments later, Beaudoin got into a fight with his wife of 18 years, Christina Nelson, in the master bedroom, reported Click2Houston. When the couple's 22-year-old son tried to intervene, deputies say the father pulled out a 9mm handgun and shot him twice in the back. The armed man then allegedly threatened his 18-year-old son, sending the teen fleeing for his life.

Engraved with the words, \"Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny,\" the antique ring lodged in the rocks clearly meant something to both Joe and Jenny. But there were no other clues (besides the fact that the words were written in English) as to where the couple might live. When she returned home to Palm Beach, Australia, Walsh was determined to reunite the ring with its owner. She went to the 5,000 members of her company's Facebook page, Kids in Adelaide, to reunite Joe and Jenny with the ring. She also created a \"Find Joe and Jenny\" page to track them down. \"Hi all. It's Roxy here. This is a reaaaallyy long shot but would love some SHARE love on this post to help find Joe. Found this gold ring snorkeling at Finns Beach in Bali today. It's got a family crest on it, and engraved with the message 'Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny' How amazing would it be to find him! Please click share.\" The post got shared all over the world. Nine months earlier, Joe Langley had been snorkeling in the same spot in Bali when he lost the ring, which his wife, Jenny, had purchased an antique store and had engraved for his birthday. \"I went for a swim, got caught in a rip, decided the rip was going to take me and finished up on the rocks,\" Langley told Sunshine Coast Daily. \"In clawing my way over the rocks, the ring pulled off my finger.\" The Langleys' 19-year-old granddaughter saw the Facebook post April 9 and made the connection. It turns out that the Langleys are fellow Australians, living in the town of Noosa, just three hours from where Walsh lives in Palm Beach. Walsh had the ring professionally cleaned before she met the happy Langleys in Noosa to return it.",

If you have the bank balance of a mogul you could splash out on the house used for location shoots in the Fox show, which is filmed in the Chicago area. The enormous 20,000 square foot mansion in the ritzy suburb of Barrington is opulent and private, sitting by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens. Scroll Down for Video . Fit for a mogul - the enormous mansion serves as the backdrop to the hit show Empire . It took five years to build the house, which sits by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens . The\u00a0sophisticated\u00a0five bedroom, nine bathroom French Country-style estate that serves as a glamorous backdrop to the show is listed at $13 million, having failed to find a buyer at $15.9 million since it first hit the market in 2013. It took five years to build the enormous mansion, with construction finally coming to a halt in 2008. This lengthy building period was partly due to the huge amount of custom woodwork and ornamentation in the house. The show centers on Lucious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, deciding which of his three sons will take over his company, Empire Entertainment . For the show, the interiors are staged often to look more dramatic than the house does in real life . The mansion even has an owner worthy of Empire, in strip club owner Sam Cecola, according to Curbed. Cecola owns the Admiral Theater strip club in Albany Park, Illinois, and previously owned the Club Paradise strip club in Las Vegas. He had to relinquish ownership of the Las Vegas property due to legal problems involving tax fraud and alleged connections to organized crime. As in the show, the stately living room features a grand piano . The house is as opulent in real life as it is in the show and has a lot of room for entertaining . The house includes a wet bar, walnut-paneled library, huge gourmet kitchen and a built-in safe and state-of-the-art security system. Outside there is a dog run, an outdoor pool, outdoor fireplace and a pond, as well as extensive waterfront views. A full bar opens out onto a terrace and the garden on the lower level . A light bright dining room just off the grand hallway . In the show, Luscious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, has been diagnosed with ALS and is trying to determine which of his three sons will succeed him and run his entertainment business. His outspoken ex-wife, Cookie, played by Taraji P. Henson, is fresh out of prison after 17 years for drug dealing and is also demanding her share of the business. The bedrooms are simply and elegantly decorated in a tasteful color palette . In the show, Lucious' daughter Lola has a bedroom fit for a princess . The formal walnut-paneled study is deeply masculine and worthy of an industry mogul . Lucious' study on the show is darker and more dramatic .",

Former Adelaide doctor Tareq Kamleh featured in the latest ISIS propaganda video at the weekend wearing western-style surgical scrubs and handling babies in a maternity ward as he urged people to join the death cult notorious for beheading non-Muslims. Despite his public support for ISIS, Dr Kamleh still remains registered to practice medicine in Australia until September 30 because the Medical Board has refused to deregister him, the\u00a0Advertiser\u00a0reports. Former Adelaide doctor Tareq Kamleh, who fled to join the Islamic State, is still allowed to practice medicine in Australia despite appearing in a propaganda video encouraging foreign medics to join the terrorist cult . The Medical Board of Australia can deregister doctors convicted of crimes and can take action against those whose conduct goes against being a 'fit and proper person'. But no action has yet been taken against Dr Kamleh. 'The role of the Medical Board of Australia is to protect the public and manage risk to patients,' the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency said. 'The Board and AHPRA are not able to comment on this matter now, as doing so could compromise any future regulatory action.' Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh\u00a0featured in the latest ISIS propaganda video at the weekend wearing western-style surgical scrubs and handling babies in a maternity ward . Dr Kamleh, who completed his medical dress at Adelaide University, worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. He then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, before working in Perth until late 2014. Dr Kamleh appeared in the ISIS recruitment video at the weekend calling for foreign medics to join him in the city of Raqqa to help launch the Islamic State Health Service. The video quickly went viral and caused his former medical colleagues in Australia to speak out. It has emerged Dr Kamleh has claimed he had unprotected sex with a Royal Adelaide Hospital patient who was a former sex worker and intravenous drug user after he checked her medical records, according to The Australian. Despite his public support for ISIS, Dr Kamleh still remains registered to practice medicine in Australia until September 30 because the Medical Board refused to deregister him . Dr Kamleh appeared in the ISIS recruitment video at the weekend calling for foreign medics to join him in the city of Raqqa to help launch the Islamic State Health Service . He also claimed to have slept with a patient at the Mannum District Hospital in South Australia. A former colleague who worked with Dr\u00a0Kamleh during his stint at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2010 said he was a sexually manipulative 'creep', a 'fraud' and a 'sleazeball'. They also said he had a number of sexual relationships with nurses, doctors and other hospital staff, drank to excess and had a strong interest in shooting. 'I feel reluctant to speak ill of a former colleague, but as he is now portraying himself as a jihadist and calling others to join the so-called caliphate, I feel I should,' the colleague, who declined to be named, said. 'At the time, he was one of the most immoral people I knew, in terms of promiscuity at least.' The doctor completed his medical degree at Adelaide University and worked at various hospitals before fleeing Australia\u00a0on a flight to Kuala Lumpur last month . The vision of Dr Kamleh handling babies in a maternity unit is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Another ex-colleague from South Australia said he had undergone a 'character transformation' over the past year. They claimed to have heard\u00a0Kamleh\u00a0had become 'devout' to such an extent he considered platonic friendships with women inappropriate, and he 'thought the way he had been living was wrong'. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton confirmed Dr\u00a0Kamleh\u00a0left the country on a flight to Kuala Lumpur last month. 'Reports on the weekend in relation to an Australian doctor going to serve in Syria are deeply disturbing,' Mr Dutton said. 'For a highly educated doctor to succumb to the message of this death cult is concerning to all Australians.' He could be sentenced to up to 25 years prison time if he returns to Australia and is charged. A former colleague who worked with Dr Kamleh during his stint at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2010 said he was a sexually manipulative 'creep', a 'fraud' and a 'sleazeball' Kamel could be sentenced to up to 25 years prison time if he returns to Australia and is charged .",

Interviewer Diane Sawyer looked shocked when he made the revelation on her ABC 20/20 special last night. Jenner said 'I've always been on the more conservative side' when he was asked about LGBT issues - and replied 'yes' when asked if he was a Republican. Sawyer had mentioned President's decision to identify trans citizens in his most recent State of The Union address. Jenner said:\u00a0\u201cHe actually was the first one to say the actual word transgender, I will certainly give him credit for that.' 'But not to get political, I\u2019ve just never been a big fan \u2014 I\u2019m kind of more on the conservative side.' Scroll down for video . Republican: Bruce Jenner told Diane Sawyer he is a Republican as he announced his transition to a woman on Friday night . Jenner added that neither the Republicans nor Democrats had a 'monopoly on understanding' and said he would lobby the GOP over LGBT rights. 'I would do that, yeah, in a heartbeat,' he said. He also said in the interview that he still considers himself a heterosexual, discussed his faith and said he was a Christian. 'I would sit in church and always wonder, \"In God\u2019s eyes, how does he see me?\"' he said. 'Maybe this is my cause in life.' His remarks came in the Friday night interview in which Jenner  revealed that he identifies as a woman - his 'true self' and a childhood dream - in an explosive ABC interview with Diane Sawyer. The 65-year-old Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star sparked rumors about his gender identity last year after visibly altering his appearance. And last night, he confirmed that he is reinventing himself physically in a bid to transition from male to female in the highly-anticipated, intimate sit-down. Speaking in front of millions of viewers, including Kim Kardashian and her family, Bruce tearfully revealed: 'For all intents and purposes, I am a woman. Christian: Jenner also said that he is a Christian and wondered whether transitioning to a woman was his cause in life . 'My brain is much more female than it is male. That's what my soul is. Bruce lives a lie. She is not a lie.' He firmly added: 'I can't do it anymore.' During the interview, Bruce also admitted that he has been regularly taking female hormones - and plans to completely transform into a woman. But he said he was still attracted to females. 'I was never attracted to the guys,' he told Diane, explaining how he has always enjoyed a good sex life. And he denied that his revelations were for publicity purposes. Instead, he made them due to his inability to continue to 'pull the curtain', he said. Indeed, hiding his identity was so painful for Bruce that it once left him contemplating suicide to escape from the never-ending scrutiny, he revealed. Many viewers and celebrities were taking to social media last night to congratulate Bruce on making a giant leap for the transgender community. Lady Gaga tweeted: '#BruceJennerABC Now that is bravery', before telling her fans to 'empower people like Bruce' globally by 'being loving & not mean'. Meanwhile, Bruce's 17-year-old daughter, Kylie Jenner, tweeted an emotional message to her father. 'Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave. My beautiful Hero,' she wrote.",

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

Whistleblower Tony Brookes, a former detective who tried to investigate the abuse, said money was diverted away from protecting the children from rape, trafficking and beatings in order to pursue so-called \u2018priority crimes\u2019. The offences, which included car crime, were considered crucial for satisfying a target culture introduced by the last Labour government. Now it has emerged the same targets were also linked to performance-related pay for top officers at South Yorkshire Police. Scroll down for video . Police ignored the sexual abuse of hundreds of young girls because they were too busy chasing Labour crime targets that would earn bonuses for senior staff (picture posed by model) It meant that, while young girls suffered heinous abuse at the hands of sex gangs in Sheffield and Rotherham, top brass could have had a perverse incentive to instruct their staff to look elsewhere. The targets have been scrapped by the Tories amid concern they were harming policing. Tory parliamentary candidate Michael Ellis, a former member of the home affairs select committee, said: \u2018Labour\u2019s grossly irresponsible obsession with targets led to a perverted sense of priorities whereby senior officers could get bonuses for prioritising car crime while hundreds of young girls were being abused with impunity.\u2019 The first details of the scandal emerged earlier this year when papers from South Yorkshire Police, relating to child abuse in Sheffield, were leaked to the BBC. The documents and the testimony of former officers suggested the force failed to pursue a number of child sexual exploitation inquiries and ignored intelligence that girls as young as 12 were being raped. A copy of a document from the force\u2019s intelligence database detailed more than 200 girls suspected of being sexually exploited. It listed more than 320 men accused of carrying out abuse, mainly between 2007 and 2010. Allegations included rapes, traffickings, child abduction and threats to scald girls by holding kettles of boiling water over them. The alleged victims were aged between 12 and 15 while their abusers included Iraqi Kurds, white British, black British, and men of Pakistani heritage. The dossier by Professor Alexis Jay (pictured)\u00a0into the Rotherham scandal described how South Yorkshire Police were \u2018more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime\u2019 than child abuse . In most cases, the files suggest there is no evidence police took any action. In 2007, after an investigation led to two Iraqi Kurds being convicted of abuse, officers asked for resources to mount a much wider investigation in Sheffield. Mr Brookes said he asked for \u00a324,000 and was given \u00a316,000. But after spending only half that amount he was told the entire budget had gone. He says the other \u00a38,000 was diverted to spend chasing \u2018district priorities, to investigate robbery, burglary and car crime\u2019. These priorities were tied to Home Office targets introduced by Labour in 2002. In Rotherham, the dossier into the scandal there by Professor Alexis Jay described how senior and middle managers at South Yorkshire Police were \u2018more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime\u2019 than tackling child abuse. At least 1,400 girls in the town were left to be abused by Asian men between 1997 and 2013 because the authorities were also too scared to admit there was a race issue, according to her report published in September. A second report by government adviser Louise Casey concluded the establishment in Rotherham ignored child sexual exploitation due to \u2018misplaced political correctness\u2019. And Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary found senior South Yorkshire officers prioritised burglary and car crime over victims of abuse. Labour\u2019s crime targets meant forces were aware that chief constables could get the sack if performance was repeatedly inadequate. The link to performance-related pay that has emerged meant senior officers could pocket bonuses worth thousands for catching criminals or reducing the incidence of so-called priority offences. This system has also been scrapped by the Tories. South Yorkshire Police said: \u2018Chief officer bonuses were ratified as part of a process overseen by police authorities.\u2019",

The Ugandan tycoon started small with a little computer shop that kept him busy after leaving school at 15. These days, his Mara Group spans over 20 countries and he's been called \"Africa's youngest billionaire.\" In late 2013 Thakkar joined forces with the former boss of Barclays bank -- Bob Diamond -- to start an investment fund focused on Africa called Atlas Mara. The powerful duo raised $325 million through a share flotation - well above the $250 million target. But his vision spans beyond Africa, and Earth -- Thakkar was the first African to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic. CNN's Marketplace Africa spoke to Thakkar about African innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN:  You are active in several African countries. How is the current business landscape on the continent? Ashish Thakkar: Right now in the last 18 years I have been active on the continent, I have never seen so much global excitement around Africa that I've seen today. The climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved. Unfortunately, it's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality. The reality on the ground is so much better than the perception. You've got to remember, as Africa, we are 54 countries. Some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues, but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit. CNN: Why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the African continent? AT: We have a very young demographic -- 85% of our populations are under the age of 35. We have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture. Yet, entrepreneurship is not in the education system. Where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance? And it's something, frankly, that I am extremely passionate about, because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants, etc. It's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises. So, it's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system, and innovation is totally embedded into that. CNN: What is it about Africa that encourages innovation? AT: The biggest advantage we have at the moment, and you've seen this with mobile phone penetration, is that we don't have legacy systems. We didn't have landlines and we didn't need them. We didn't have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere. We leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony. Today, we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than North America and Western Europe put together. We can actually leapfrog in so many different ways. Mobile money is another brilliant example. Mobile money was created in Kenya. The whole concept of having money on your phone, which is the best thing because it's secure, it's practical, made more sense. So, these kind of innovations, you're going to see a lot more of on the continent. I spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when I travel across the continent, and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they're coming up with is just so inspiring. CNN: What advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who's just starting out? AT: Entrepreneurship is a journey, it's not a destination. There are going to be so many challenges, you are going to get knocked down so many times, but you've got to get up, dust yourself off and get back to it. The persistence, the passion, and staying on course is very crucial. You'll be tempted to cut corners, you'll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker, but it never lasts. People say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we're not. We're the leaders of today, but it's our responsibility to take the seat at the table. CNN: What needs to be done most urgently to grow African economies? AT: Pan-African collaboration is extremely important. I think things like regional integration, inter-African trade does need to increase and is increasing. I mean, the progress in the East African community has been amazing. The manner in which they've harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic. So, we need to see more of that take place on the continent. The fact that we're 54 countries, yet we're a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage. I think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial. CNN: Are you confident about the future of the continent? AT: I am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership, the mindset of our leaders. It is so inspiring to see that. It's unfortunate that, you know, globally the highlight remains things like Ebola...The little issues that we do have are just magnified, yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing. CNN: Is this Africa's century? AT: Mara's logo is the African Lion and our little joke, which a lot of people don't appreciate, hence I love it even more, is that the Indian Tiger and the Chinese Dragon have had their days and it's now the African Lion's turn. And it genuinely is -- this is our turn. More from Marketplace Africa . Read this: Africa's green lean speed machines . Read this: Family ties mixed with fresh fruit on island paradise .

Three men have today been arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence. North Yorkshire police confirmed the men - all aged in their 50s and from the York area - were arrested this morning. The body of the missing chef, who was 35 when she disappeared in 2009, has still not been found. Officers have now launched a fresh search for evidence which could lead to her whereabouts, which is set to continue over a number of days. Police and forensic officers have been working at three houses not far from where Miss Lawrence lived in the Heworth area of York before she went missing six years ago. It is understood the three men have not been arrested before and they remain in custody. A man, in his 50s and from the York area, was arrested last month on suspicion of her murder. He was later released on bail. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009. She was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at the University of York. Detectives began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of York, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. They have also issued previously unseen CCTV footage of two people walking near the house. The new arrests, and the arrest in March, are understood to be linked to these lines of inquiry. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, head of North Yorkshire Police's Major Crime Unit and the senior investigating officer in the Claudia Lawrence inquiry, said:\u00a0'I urge everyone to again show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important enquiries. Your co-operation and support is greatly appreciated by the investigation team.'

At the address nearest to Miss Lawrence home, uniformed police wearing face masks could be seen carrying out brown evidence bags. At another property, forensics officers wearing white protective suits were clearly at work. Each of the houses is under police guard. Martin Dales, friend of Claudia's father, said the new\u00a0arrests\u00a0were a positive movement in the investigation but that progress was a\u00a0series of\u00a0ups and downs for the family. Speaking outside the chef's house, he said: 'Peter finds it very hard,\u00a0going up\u00a0and down. 'You feel like you might be getting somewhere and then you get let\u00a0down. 'Three arrests is certainly a big movement for the police though. 'That's four people in the space of one month.

Jessa, 22, and her 19-year-old husband Ben   announced the\u00a0the news of their pregnancy ina video for\u00a0TLC.com, which featured them both\u00a0making health smoothies, and Jessa has revealed that one of the first things the couple considered after hearing the news was how to adjust her workouts accordingly, to ensure that she can remain fit and active while expecting. Speaking to People magazine, the reality star explained that when it comes to exercising: 'I'm just trying not to overdo it right now. I am still working out, but not trying to break any records. Scroll down for video . Expecting: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald recently revealed that she is pregnant with their first child . Announcement: The baby is due on November 1, which is also the date of Ben and Jessa's first wedding anniversary . 'I want to gain a little less weight and not stress out about it. I do want to make sure that I'm eating healthy. You are eating for two but the other is, like, a speck. I am trying to make healthy choices now that I'm entering my second trimester.' The pair, who married after a chaste courtship, are well-known for their health-conscious lifestyle and are often seen on the Duggars\u2019 hit reality series enjoying healthy dinners or working out together, something which viewers saw frequently during the build-up to the couple\u2019s wedding, during which time Jessa was incredibly keen to trim down her already-toned physique. A recent episode of the show even saw Jessa pushing Ben's truck down the road while wearing workout pants covered with knee-length skirts to maintain their 'standard of modesty'. Jessa also frequently posts recipes and photos of healthy foods she's trying out on Instagram. Juiced up: Jessa and Ben are both champions of healthy eating, and even announced their pregnancy in an adorable video while making smoothies . Push it along: While getting ready for her wedding, Jessa stepped up her workout, part of which involved pushing her fiance's truck down a dirt road with her siblings inside . Interesting attire: The women in the religious Duggar family wear skirts over their workout pants to maintain their 'standard of modesty' As for her pregnancy diet, when Jessa discovered the news, she said that she thought she would take after other Duggar mothers when it came to her pregnancy cravings, but admitted that this hasn\u2019t been the case. 'I am feeling pretty good,' she added to People. 'I thought I'd crave pickles and lemons because my mother did, but I couldn't stand them. 'I'm hoping I'm having triplets because I've been eating so much!' However, Jessa does admit she will be looking to her older sister Jill for advice, as the 23-year-old just welcomed a son Israel with husband Derick Dillard on April 6, and is also a trained midwife. Jill kept up her exercise during the later months of pregnancy by\u00a0walking on the treadmill while listening to sermons. 70 hours later: Jessa's sister Jill Dillard (pictured) welcomed her son Israel on April 6 with her husband Derick after almost three full days of labor . Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c) Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.",

Despite its secluded location it is home to the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy,\u00a0the world's largest Buddhist settlement. A vibrant splash of red, this colourful settlement has sprung up in the 1980s and is now a haven for over 40,000 monks and nuns. Larung Gar Buddhist Academy is home to 40,000 monks and nuns, who travel to the settlement of\u00a0Sertar to study Tibetan Buddhism . The red and brown houses are nearly identical, with one to three rooms per hut and no heating or toilets installed . The settlement is home to 40,000 nuns and monks, who flock to study, attend lectures and dwell in the mountains . Local children gather after class on one of the banks in the hilly religious institution. Monks and nuns are segregated by a winding road . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study at the remote dwelling. The wooden huts are built so closely together, they look like a red sea spreading up the hilly terrain. Nuns and monks are housed near to their colleges, and separated by age and sex. The segregation of male and female living quarters is marked by a winding road, which weaves through the dense mass of huts. All monks and nuns live close to the college but are housed in different district according the age and sex of students . Prayer forms an important part in the life of the monks who travel from multiple countries to attend lectures and classes in the area . Sky burials are common in the province of Tibet and involve corpses being cut and left for animals to devour. The human bodies are placed on mountaintops in order for the elements or predatory animals, typically vultures, to prey upon it. The majority of Tibetans and many Mongolians adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits. They believe after death the body is an empty vessel and there is no need to preserve it. By allowing nature or animals to take command of the body, they are disposing of the remains in the most generous way. In many areas of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and, due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical. Conditions are basic, with residents having to share communal toilets, and each unheated hut ranging from one to three rooms in size. An isolated religious haven, Sertar is located around 370 miles from Chengdu, and those wishing to visit have to travel by coach for a gruelling 20 hours. TVs are prohibited at the picturesque retreat, with monks and nuns flocking to benefit from the studies, prayers and lectures ran at the academy. The settlement has grown from a handful of disciples in the 1980s to become one of the largest centres for the study of Tibetan Buddhism . Prayer is undertaken by spinning the decorative prayer wheels which are located around the Buddhist settlement . Monks study after their lessons. Visitors are welcomed into the monastery to learn and witness the classes . Monks pray inside the biggest temple of the town. Inside, children and adults gather on the floor to sing songs . Photographer Wanson Luk journeyed to the secluded location from Chengdu on a 20-hour bumpy coach ride. The 34-year-old Buddhist said the Larung Area has two small guest houses, but as these were occupied, he had to stay near the entrance. He stayed two days at the Buddhist centre, taking part in ceremonies. Luk said that the settlement welcomes everyone, and they maintain their life in the hills from donations and by small businesses like the guest house or small grocery store. Sertar attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia . Tibetan monks, also known as lamas, are pictured at a grocery in the Serthar Buddhist Institute in China . 'I was most surprised about how people feel about death,' Luk said. 'I took part in the sky burial ceremony where there were hundreds or thousands of condors waiting quietly.\u00a0There were 7 corpses on that day...one of them was a child. 'During the ceremony a monk will pray then the \"sky burial master\" will start cutting the corpses.\u00a0When he is done, the condors will all fly to the corpses . 'They believe the more the condors eat, the better it is and they will not eat bad people's body.' Nuns travel to school by walking down the steep verges which can peak at nearly three miles high . Snow covers the surrounding hills of the\u00a0Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, where conditions can be bleak in the winter months . The resplendent Buddhist monastery is the focal feature of the academy, with a wall to prevent monks and nuns from mingling . At the peak close to the town, monks tie colourful prayer flags as a practical sign of their religious devotion . One encounter which struck a chord for Luk was the meeting of a nun who was on her 'no speech day'. When the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist. She ended up taking him around the whole monastery, showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray. Although TVs are prohibited in the monastery, iPhones strangely are permitted, with her typing words to instruct him as they went. At night the view of the Serthar Buddhist Institute is magical, with thousands of little lights illuminating the rolling hills . The settlement is also home to a number of Tibetan people who share the land with the monks and nuns . Prayer stones decorate the colourful Buddhist academy, which is only accessible by a long coach journey . Tibetan nuns, also known as lamas, are pictured on a street in the Serthar Buddhist Institute . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study here . Many of the Buddhists own second-hand  iPhone 4s. The incredible academy was established in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by Jigme Phuntsok, an influential lama of the Nyingma tradition. Despite its remote situation, Larung Gar evolved from a handful of disciples to be the largest Buddhist settlement in the world. It attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, who attend separate classes taught in Mandarin, while larger classes are taught in Tibetan.",

Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashcam as he drove along the Interstate 35E in Texas last Wednesday. Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told\u00a0waxahachietx.com\u00a0that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours.

He added: 'Basically, based off that from the attending paramedics and firefighters, there was enough evidence there to suggest that she was drinking. 'That is the reason why we got a warrant for her blood.' After undergoing treatment, Mayeaux apparently admitted to police that she was trying to take her own life. She was released from hospital last Friday. In a puff of smoke: Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air .

It is not known if Mayeaux will face charges and the event remains under investigation. Riveria, who caught the near-fatal crash on his camera, said he remains shaken up by what he saw.

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

On this faltering, unconvincing evidence, the holders of the last Heineken Cup face a mammoth task if they are to stop Clermont Auvergne from claiming the inaugural Champions Cup. Bernard Laporte\u2019s stellar side didn\u2019t come to life until this dismal encounter went into extra-time and they were only galvanised once they had been reduced to 14 men, when Ali Williams was sin-binned for taking out Devin Toner in the air. Toulon winger\u00a0Bryan Habana races away for a decisive try in extra-time against Leinster . Habana intercepted Ian Madigan's long pass to race away unopposed at Stade\u00a0Velodrome . Leinster full back Rob Kearney beats Toulon flanker\u00a0Juan Fernandez Lobbe to a high ball in the first-half . Instead of being undermined by the loss of the ex-All Blacks lock, Toulon scored the crucial points while he was off the field. Their victory was founded on the composed goal-kicking of their Welsh Lion at full-back, Leigh Halfpenny, who finished with 20 points from six penalties and a conversion. Leinster attempted to capitalise on their numerical advantage and it backfired in the 90th minute as Ian Madigan\u2019s long pass was intercepted by Bryan Habana and the Springbok wing stormed clear to for the game\u2019s only try. That the one fleeting flicker of creativity stemmed from an error was fitting. The Irish province wouldn\u2019t go quietly and when Sean O\u2019Brien went over from a close-range lineout drive, they were back in the hunt with five minutes remaining, but it wasn\u2019t to be. So, the climax of the new continental tournament will have a familiar feel. Toulon vs Clermont is an all-French repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final in Dublin, which the Cote d\u2019Azur club won despite being dominated by Clermont for much of the game. Last year, they gave Jonny Wilkinson the perfect career sign-off with another triumph in Cardiff \u2013 where Saracens were dispatched \u2013 and now they are closing in on a hat-trick. But there was no swagger about them on Sunday, or any sustained power surges for that matter. It was unusually wet by the Mediterranean and the conditions made handling difficult, but that didn\u2019t account for the sheer deluge of fumbles made by both sides. As a showcase of Europe\u2019s elite event, this stop-start contest left much to be desired. For all the effort and commitment, there was no fluency or cohesion, no rhythm or flow. The teams simply took it in turns to launch a raid and either spill the ball or concede a turnover. Leinster centre Madigan fires over one of his five successful penalties against Toulon . English referee Wayne Barnes became the pantomime villain of the home supporters for repeatedly penalising their idols, but he had every right to on several occasions, particularly when Xavier Chiocci, the Toulon loosehead prop, was being dismantled by Ireland tighthead Mike Ross in the scrum. As an occasion, this was several notches below the blood-and-thunder epic between Clermont and Saracens in St Etienne 24 hours earlier. Clermont\u2019s \u2018Yellow Army\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018Jaunards\u2019 \u2013 created a raucous, partisan atmosphere which wasn\u2019t matched here by the Toulon hordes. There was a healthy crowd in excess of 35,000, but that was a long way short of capacity and the noise was often restricted to boos for the officials. Even the Mexican Waves late on were half-hearted. Leinster blindside Jordi Murphy does brilliantly to get up and disrupt a Toulon lineout . Still, it was not all grim. Steffon Armitage made his trademark breakdown impact after coming on as a replacement and Halfpenny\u2019s class stood out throughout \u2013 not just as a goal-kicker but, crucially, in the way he handled the aerial onslaught with aplomb. The Wales idol had landed four penalties in normal time but saved his best for the end of the first half of extra-time \u2013 just before Habana\u2019s try \u2013 when he struck from halfway, with inches to spare. Afterwards, he reflected on the prospect of a first appearance in Europe\u2019s elite final, saying: \u2018It\u2019s what I grew up dreaming about. Toulon No 8\u00a0Chris Masoe makes a strong run as Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss tries to make the tackle . \u2018I grew up watching European Cup Finals and you work hard day-in, day-out to be involved in big games like that. For me, coming to Toulon with the success they\u2019 ve achieved and the ambition they have, I wanted to be part of that. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity.\u2019 Toulon were fortunate that he took his opportunities on Sunday. It meant that their shortcomings were not critically exposed and they will surely rouse themselves to far greater heights for the final. Their showdown with Clermont will shake Twickenham to its foundations. These twin French giants are the dominant forces of the era - the rest of Europe are chasing their shadows. Toulon full back Leigh Halfpenny makes no mistake from the kicking tee after Leinster infringed .",

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members \u2013 something that anyone can become by joining free \u2013 while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury. The former Wimbledon champion \u2013 currently practising in Spain before beginning his Spring clay court campaign \u2013 is pleased with the venue, and may be called upon to play doubles as well as two singles matches.",

Fly-half Colin Slade is thought to be deciding between a move to Toulon or Pau in France \u2013 while the latter club have already landed Conrad Smith. The prospect of piles of Euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the Top 14 league the destination du jour, for southern stars seeking a stint abroad. What makes the Piutau deal so eye-catching is that it is a bold endorsement of Ulster\u2019s ambition and also a boost to the wider Celtic game, below Test level. That boost is much-needed, because there are simmering problems \u2013 as exposed and bemoaned by Leinster\u2019s head coach Matt O\u2019Connor last weekend. The Australian was infuriated by the softly-softly stance of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose final say on release of Test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the Pro 12 clash with leaders Glasgow. Alun Wyn Jones can put his body on the line for\u00a0Ospreys and Wales . \u2018It hurts the league,\u2019 said the Australian, which is absolutely true. The Pro 12 has a credibility issue, due to the continuing absence of so many Irish stars from so many matches. While player welfare is quite rightly prioritised, there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions. No wonder the Welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the Aviva Premiership clubs during the European rebellion last year. A leading figure such as Alun Wyn Jones gives body and soul to the Ospreys week after week, but still found the energy to face down the more rested Irish in Cardiff during the Six Nations. He and so many others in Wales would enhance the Premiership. If the Irish cannot fully commit to a league \u2013 making it a fitting stage for Piutau\u2019s class \u2013 they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for European combat with their provinces. Scrap the LV Cup and bring the regions into an expanded Premiership. Job done. Wasps forward Hughes\u00a0was clumsy, not reckless . Wasps players were incensed by the three-game ban handed to their No 8, Nathan Hughes, for the collision which left George North unconscious last Friday night, and their angst is understandable. The big Fijian was clumsy, but no more, by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the Lions wing, as he scored a try. Nathan Hughes\u00a0was clumsy rather than\u00a0reckless and didn't deserve a three-game ban . The disciplinary panel called the offence \u2018reckless\u2019 and the reaction of Wasps captain James Haskell was priceless. \u2018Rugby is reckless,\u2019 he said. \u2018The whole game is reckless. If you\u2019re going to worry about that\u2026 maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch.\u2019 The England flanker had a point. The sport is founded on physicality and danger. A player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated, damaging contact, however accidental, but the suspicion lingers that Hughes is serving a ban because North was knocked out. If the scorer had jumped up and walked off, it\u2019s fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed. Fill World Cup seats or face fan fury . Is anyone really surprised that trying to buy World Cup tickets is such a drawn-out ordeal? For those without the benefit of a corporate invite (or a media pass, before anyone pipes up), securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of root-canal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket. The Webb Ellis Cup visits a school in Toronto as part of the Rugby World Cup Trophy Tour . We are in the cost-cutting age of do-it-all-online, so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on Monday. At least the old-fashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit, as so wonderfully evident at Wimbledon tennis down the years. Ultimately, the World Cup will be a sell-out, but organisers better be right when they say there won\u2019t be the empty seats which blighted the Olympics. As if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough, those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of well-heeled \u2018guests\u2019 can\u2019t be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena, or even turn up at all. Signing Sinfield is an inspired move . It\u2019s been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt, which is harsh on all concerned. Kevin Sinfield is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in Leeds later this year, from the Rhinos to Yorkshire Carnegie. Yorkshire Carnegie's signing of rugby league legend\u00a0Kevin Sinfield is a statement of intent . He wants to play fly-half and while the prospect of him igniting the Championship at the age of 34 is far-fetched, he is a proven leader and winner, and his mentality is what the union side at Headingley are keen to tap into. No doubt, he\u2019ll bring a few more through the turnstiles, too, but coach Bryan Redpath will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him. It is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation, Leeds are another second-tier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile. Last Word . Team GB, under the auspices of England, face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the Olympic Sevens tournament in Rio. In Hong Kong last weekend, Simon Amor\u2019s side \u2013 nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of Great Britain, ahead of Wales and Scotland \u2013 lost further ground to Australia and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings, one below the final qualification slot. This weekend in Tokyo, they must try to catch their rivals from Down Under, but they have been drawn in a pool with Fiji, who won in Hong Kong and are second in the rankings behind South Africa. Realistically, one Olympic place is up for grabs, behind those nations and New Zealand, and England\u2019s advantage is that the series culminates at Twickenham next month. Sadly, Team GB\u2019s preparations \u2013 complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby \u2013 have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight, and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting.",

It was widely believed that the new ECB regime led by chief executive Tom Harrison and chairman Colin Graves would waste little time in appointing from a short list of former England captains Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart. But instead the Board are going to instigate a recruitment process involving head hunters Sport Recruitment International, who would be expected to suggest some overseas candidates as well as the trio already in the frame. Alec Stewart admitted he has had no contact with the ECB over the  role of England cricket director . Michael Vaughan has been among the leading candidates to take up the newly-created role with England . The main problem is that the job description has yet to be fixed.

The severe cuts that Sky have been forced to make since agreeing their \u00a311m-a-match Premier League deal is apparent even in the Caribbean.

Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of V\u00e1c in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Ter\u00e9zia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by \u2018new\u2019 diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of V\u00e1c's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria\u00a0Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second\u2013fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in\u00a0V\u00e1c in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'",

Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, was arrested after he burst into\u00a0Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham wielding an axe and demanding cash, as an accomplice stood at the door. But he was foiled after shopkeeper Sab Dhillon heard McKarry's demands and ran from the back of the shop and rugby tackled him to the floor. Mr Dhillon's wife then appeared clutching her son's baseball bat and managed to subdue him further. Scroll down for video . Prolific thief Shaun Andrew McKerry was once dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' because he always returned home after his many crimes, and he has been unmasked as the axe wielding thief in an attempted post office robbery - where he was subdued by the owner who rugby tackled him and his wife with a baseball bat (left) McKerry was dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' in the 1990s after he was arrested\u00a080 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998. He got his nickname because he always returned home after his crimes. He committed his first offence at the age of 11 and in the next five years went on to commit 1,000 crimes. His own mother even previously pleaded for her teenage son, known as a one man crime wave, to be locked up. McKerry pleaded guilty\u00a0at Durham Crown Court, via videolink from prison, to attempted robbery from the post office on March 15. CCTV footage of the incident shows the 31-year-old burst into the store and demand\u00a0terrified assistant Andrea Brighty fill his bag with money. But Mr Dhillon heard the incident and ran from the back of the store to pounce on McKerry. After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat. McKerry is pictured in handcuffs at the age of 15 when he was committing strings of offences in the area . As Mr Dhillon held him, the shop assistant removed McKerry's scarf so his face could be shown to the cameras. His accomplice, who had been standing guard at the door when they burst in, fled. Mrs Dhillon said: 'It was really scary. We didn't realise who he was at the time and how bad his previous convictions were.' Her husband told the Northern Echo: 'He did not hit me but there was a good chance that he could have as he was waving the axe about blindly while he was on the floor. Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor . 'I am OK and we're trying to get over it and we just want to put this behind us.' McKerry, who will be sentenced on April 24, is known by the nickname 'Boomerang Boy' or 'Homing Pigeon Boy' because he always returned home after his crimes. He once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His catalogue of offending included car chases with police, a string of burglary convictions, aggravated vehicle taking, sending indecent letters, witness intimidation, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and countless breaches of curfew, community sentences and offending while on bail. CCTV images show Mr Dhillon pouncing on 31-year-old McKerry, armed with an axe, from behind . Mr Dhillon and the terrified shop assistant (right) subdued McKerry and revealed his face for the cameras . Mr Dhillon tackled McKerry and both he and his wife said they did not realise his criminal history at the time . McKerry's case was even brought to the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair, who later announced a crackdown on so called 'bail-bandits'. He began offending from the age of 11, and has clocked up dozens of court appearances. On March 11, 1999, McKerry, of County Durham, had already been arrested five times between January 22 and February 10. Shaun Andrew McKerry started offending at the age of 11 when he committed his first theft in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000 he clocked up 1,000 offences. In the 12 months of 1995 he was arrested 80 times. McKerry managed to stay out of prison for 36 weeks in 1998, and was arrested 45 times. He was arrested five times between January 22 and February 10, 1999. McKerry became known as a one man crime wave and was dubbed Boomerang Boy because he always returned home, police knowing where to find him. His mother even called for her teenage son to be arrested. In 1999 she said: 'I love him as a son but I hate the person he has become.' In one of his earlier crimes McKerry  stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman. By the age of 15 McKerry had\u00a0convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. When he was 16 McKerry was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for\u00a0robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. At the age of 18 he was out of prison and had offended again, but was given a 'second chance' by magistrates. Just three days later he was back again. From then on he stuck to low level crimes to feed his drug habit. In 2011 he was jailed for four years after he admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. In March he was rugby tackled and restrained by Sab Dhillon when he went into the store, armed with an axe and demanded cash. He has 55 previous convictions. He boasted after one court appearance he would be back and returned just 48 hours later on suspicion of taking a car. The 15-year-old was then placed on a supervision order despite a report to magistrates that he was a danger to the public. Magistrates tried to provide him with a string of second chances and opportunities to rehabilitate himself - but each time he re-offended. In February 2000 the press won a landmark legal victory to name him when the Lord Chief Justice ruled Bishop Auckland Youth Court had done nothing legally wrong when it agreed to the paper's application to lift the juvenile's automatic right to anonymity. Lord Bingham said he had taken a great interest in the case which centred on the individual youth's right to freedom and anonymity against the public's right to be better protected by knowing his identity. As he continued to offend McKerry developed a drug problem and stole to feed his habit. Six months later McKerry, then 16, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. This was later cut on appeal but by March 2002, aged 18, he was back behind bars again after admitting two new offences - three days after being given yet another 'last chance' by magistrates. McKerry had been granted bail after admitting theft on a Monday but was picked up 48 hours later after helping raid a Bishop Auckland clothing shop. In 2002 his mother Paula Harp, 32, pleaded for him to be arrested after she said he had ruined her life. She claimed he started to offend because he was a bit of a loner, and began doing minor things like throwing stones before his behaviour escalated. In recent years, much of his offending has been for the theft of low value items, from shops in the south-west Durham area. But in May, 2011 he was jailed for four years at Durham Crown Court which heard he only had 18 months to live if his drug and alcohol abuse continued. McKerry admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. His lawyer said he had deep vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver, as a result of years of substance abuse. The court heard he had 55 previous convictions for 120 offences.",

Grace Rebecca Mann, 20, was found unconscious by two female roommates in the home they shared in\u00a0Fredericksburg, near the college campus, about 3pm. Local reports say Mann was asphyxiated and found with a plastic bag stuffed into her throat, however police have not commented on the cause of death. The fourth roommate of the house, Steven Vander Briel, 30, was home when the two women stumbled upon the body, but ran out of the house, according to\u00a0Fredericksburg.com. Scroll down for video . Murdered:\u00a0A University of Mary Washington student has been charged with abduction and murder in the death of his roommate, 20-year-old Grace Rebecca Mann of Falls Church (pictured) Charged: Steven Vander Briel, 30 (left), is accused of killing Mann (right), an active UMW junior, and fleeing the scene. He was arrested two hours later in a church parking lot. Mann is believed to have been asphyxiated . One of the women started to perform CPR as the other called 911. Mann\u00a0- the daughter of a juvenile and domestic relations court judge in Fairfax County - was rushed to Mary Washington Hospital, but pronounced dead shortly after arriving. A major manhunt was subsequently launched for Briel. A nearby school, James Monroe High School, was placed on lock-down as officers scoured the streets with police dogs. Just over two hours later, about 5.30pm, some officers saw Briel emerge from the woods near Riverside First Church of God on Fall Hill Avenue. He was arrested and taken in for questioning. Police have since charged Briel with first-degree murder and abduction. Scene:\u00a0Grace Rebecca Mann, 20, was found unconscious by two female roommates in a home on Washington Avenue about 3 p.m., Fredericksburg Police said. Four people lived at the home - Mann and Briel, and two other females that found Mann's body .

Accused: Police have charged Steven Vander Briel, 30, with first-degree murder and abduction in the death of Grace Rebecca Mann . Family: Grace Mann is the daughter of Thomas Mann, a juvenile and domestic relations court judge in Fairfax County, and Melissa Mann, local media reported . There was no known personal relationship between Mann and Briel, other than the fact they lived together,NBC Washington\u00a0reported. No motive has been released and the circumstances surrounding the death also remain unknown. Briel attended UMW from 2002 to 2007 and then re-enrolled for the spring 2015 semester as a political science major. Mann was a junior from Falls Church, Virginia. She was a history and American studies major. She also was an executive board member of Feminist United and recently appointed to the President\u2019s Task Force on Sexual Assault. She was also a member of the Student Government Association Senate. 'She was moving mountains,' one student, Theresa Buczek, wrote on Facebook.

Popular: Mann was an executive board member of Feminist United and recently appointed to the President\u2019s Task Force on Sexual Assault. As word spread around campus Friday, tributes started pouring in for Mann, who was described as determined and energetic. UMW Senior Paige McKinsey told NBC Washington that Mann was working towards becoming a lawyer. 'As an American Studies major, Grace focused her studies on the mass incarceration rates of underprivileged communities with hopes of becoming a lawyer to one day serve those communities,' McKinsey said. 'As a friend, Grace brought love and joy into every interaction and every person she came across.'",

David Hibbitt, 33, was diagnosed with the disease in July 2012 and underwent\u00a0chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery to remove his large bowel. Doctors told him the cancer was terminal - so he decided to try cannabis oil as a last resort and bought it from a local dealer for \u00a350 a gram. Now the father-of-one says he has been cancer-free since his last scan in January \u00a0- and puts the class-B drug down to his miracle recovery. David Hibbitt, 33, claims doctors said he had between 18 months and five years to live after being diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. In desperation, he tried cannabis oil, which he now credits with his recovery . He is now looking forward to the future after tying the knot with his partner of six years Heather Martin, 26, at a registry office today. Mr Hibbitt, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Friends had told me about cannabis oil and I dismissed it at first. I've never been into drugs. 'But in February last year I was told I only had 18 months to five years to live, and I felt I had to try everything I could. 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die.' After going online to research his options, he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it. 'I pay around \u00a350 for a gram from a bloke I know who makes it,' he said. 'That lasts me about a month usually. 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy. 'The pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job. 'I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there.' Mr Hibbitt was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer after initially being told he was suffering from piles. Mr Hibbitt, with fiance Heather, said: 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die' After undergoing treatment at the Christie Hospital, in Manchester, the cancer returned and he had another operation in July 2013 followed by more chemotherapy. He was given the all-clear before Christmas that year, but a month later he found a lump, and was told the cancer was in the lymph nodes in his groin. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn't good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'Researchers are collecting patients' experiences to build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabinoid-based drugs in order to gather solid data on whether they benefit people with cancer.' Mr Hibbitt, who works in advertising, added: 'This time they told me there wasn't a lot they could do. 'In July, after doing a lot of research, I got some cannabis oil. I was having chemo, and I was getting to a point where I couldn't really do much, I had no energy. 'In August I decided I'd had enough and I was going to stop the chemotherapy. In October, he had an operation to remove the affected lymph nodes at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. But he chose to carry on taking cannabis oil rather than have any more treatment, deciding against further chemotherapy sessions. Following a scan in January he was given the all-clear - paving the way for him to organise his wedding. Mr Hibbitt, who has a five-year-old son, Ashton, said: 'We never thought this would happen, it's great. Fingers crossed now I will grow old. 'I feel really good and I hope my story will help other people.' His fiance Heather, a nursery nurse, said: 'I didn't want him to take the cannabis oil at first because it's illegal, but I saw the change in him and slowly got used to it. 'He is a determined person and did a lot of research. He wanted to live. 'We are all amazed how well he's done. I can't see my life without him. We have come through a hell of a lot.' Describing the effects of cannabis oil, he said: 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy.The pain just seemed to disappear. I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there' Cancer Research UK says it is aware of patients using cannabis extracts to treat themselves but stressed there is 'no good evidence'  to prove it was safe and effective. The charity is supporting clinical trials into the use of the drug and a synthetic cannabinoid to treat the disease. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours.

Scroll down and you'll eventually find your first female face: none other than Barbie, 'CEO Barbie' to be precise, a doll which first appeared in the Eighties, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase. The image of Barbie is the 96th result on the page, and ironically comes from a 2005 spoof article courtesy of The Onion that jokingly states 'women don't run companies'. Spot the stereotype! Barbie is the 96th image to come up on Google Images when you enter the search term 'CEO', after rows and rows of grinning suit-clad men . Several high-powered women, including women's right campaigner Chelsea Clinton, have re-tweeted the results of the search, which is being seen by many as a sad reflection on the general state of women in the workplace. Google, like other search engines, generates images based on a knot of complex algorithms related to file names and key words. The more 'popular' and relevant an image is, the higher up the ranks it will move. After Barbie, the next female - and the first human one - you'll find upon searching Google Images for 'CEO' doesn't pop up until several lines more of men, and is Jessica Herrin, CEO of a jewellery company called Stella & Dot. Incidentally, a new study from the University of Washington recently found that results like these are indeed contributing to gender bias, and perpetuating outdated views on women in the workplace. Shining example? The image (pictured) is of 'CEO Barbie', a doll which first appeared in the 80s, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase . Noted: Chelsea Clinton was one of the many high-powered women to retweet the results of the search . The study concluded: 'Manipulated image search results could determine, on average, seven per cent of a study participant\u2019s subsequent opinion about how many men and women work in a particular field.' Earlier this year, it was determined by the Professional Boards Forum\u2019s BoardWatch that for the first time ever, the proportion of women on FTSE 500 boards in the UK had reached 20 per cent. Of the images returned by Google from a 'CEO' search, only 11 per cent were of women. And unlike most scenarios concerning gender inequality, nothing is to blame here but a set of internet algorithms. Funny side: One Twitter user deemed the phenomenon 'hilarious' In a nutshell: The Atlantic pointed out that Google Images' definition of a CEO was 'mostly white guys and Barbie' Misrepresentation: Others hinted that the results were woefully out-of-date .",

But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna\u2019s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair\u2019s popularity. Brookstein\u2019s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It\u2019s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair\u2019s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: \u2018Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.\u2019 Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned \u00a3303,000 in addition to his MP\u2019s salary, mostly from \u00a31,600-an-hour appearances on Iran\u2019s Press TV and Russia Today. The national treasure that is Andrew Marr gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign. \u2018There\u2019s this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life. To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,\u2019 he writes in The Spectator. \u2018They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don\u2019t want to talk about taxation. \u2018The deficit? Apparently if it\u2019s left alone it\u2019s just going to melt away. Huddled-down, risk-averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children.\u2019 Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's 'Controls On Immigration' mug embarrassing . Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour\u2019s embarrassing \u2018Controls On Immigration\u2019 mug at the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in her Sky News interview yesterday. Cooper coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras. \u2018A storm in a coffee cup,\u2019 Cooper, aka Mrs Ed Balls, said. The influential Labour Uncut blog says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon\u2019s claim that Red Ed Miliband \u2018stabbed his own brother in the back\u2019 to lead Labour, and would do the same to Britain by negotiating away Trident, will help the Tories. \u2018The manner in which Ed Miliband defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with Labour canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of Ed Miliband as an untrustworthy leader,\u2019 the website says. \u2018The gutter is an ugly place to be but. . . it\u2019s where elections are won.\u2019 Plaid Cymru is under pressure to dump its candidate for Ceredigion, Mike Parker, for saying in 2001 English-born inhabitants of rural Wales were \u2018gun-toting final solution crackpots\u2019.

The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities. Photos from the party flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity at Clemson University in South Carolina has been put on probation for two years after the group held a Christmas theme party that flared up racial tensions on campus . Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting last December's frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes . The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California. The incident caused a backlash as black students protested and said Clemson didn't do enough to promote racial tolerance. About 6 percent of Clemson's students are black. All SAE activity was suspended by Clemson indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party. Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation found that the fraternity violated alcohol rules and student conduct codes. It will be on probation until February 2017. Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students last December making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and that such events would not be tolerated. White students dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and sported fake 'thug' tattoos . Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year \u2013 all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night's ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this. He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. 'But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.' A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was disbanded last month after members were taped singing a racist song.

Her food allergies change so frequently, keeping track is almost pointless. It was just another day with another massive allergic reaction. She can always tell when one is coming on. \"I just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom.\" Her labradoodle, Moose, starts alerting, licking her hands frantically. \"I'll feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach, and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling. And we have to treat it really fast.\" On that particular day in March, multiple EpiPens didn't slow the reaction. The paramedics who arrived to take Brynn to Greenville Memorial Hospital, or \"Hotel Greenville\" as she likes to call it, knew her well. When she asked for her security blanket, they knew to hand her her smartphone. \"New day, new crisis,\" Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong. It might as well be. When you're allergic to life, a near-death experience is no big deal. Less than a week after her trip to the hospital, Brynn, 21, is back at home in Easley, South Carolina. She lies on her back, her head near the foot of her bed, chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port. Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. The disinfectant burns, and Brynn's blood pressure hits 150/102. Her heart rate rockets to 128. \"The meds we have to give her to keep her alive, she reacts to,\" Melissa says, shaking her head. \"Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. \" Brynn was seemingly a normal kid -- until she wasn't. Yes, she was a fussy baby. Yes, she got sick often as a child, Melissa muses out loud -- but what kid doesn't? Brynn was also incredibly energetic, always the center of attention. Her father, Barry, jokingly rues the day she learned to talk. She started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11. That was the same year doctors diagnosed Brynn with IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. \"She's always been --\" Melissa Duncan pauses. \"High maintenance!\" Brynn fills in with a laugh. It wasn't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that Brynn had her first serious allergic reaction. The next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors' appointments. Brynn saw specialist after specialist. The gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis, or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles. A cardiologist said she had POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes, her blood pressure dropped, leaving her light-headed and nauseated. A Wake Forest doctor diagnosed her with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints. After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. They found a specialist online, Dr. Lawrence Afrin, who at the time was working in Charleston. They waited nearly nine months to see him, but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life-changing. Scientists don't know yet what causes mast cell disease. Researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior, but the mutations vary from one patient to the next. Because of this, scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life. But genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations. Mast cells are the regulators of your immune system. They're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites, or when you come into contact with an allergen. They basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong. Until recently, the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis, which is characterized by \"abnormal proliferation and activation\" of the body's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways. But in the last few years doctors such as Afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number. \"It's like I'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction,\" Brynn explains simply. Fruit, vegetables, milk, soy, nuts, smoke, perfume, the sun -- you name it, Brynn is allergic to it. But it's not really about the specifics; the allergens change depending on how \"angry\" her mast cells are that day, she says. On good days, she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes. On bad days, even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain. Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. \"Oh God, no,\" Afrin says when asked. \"No, no, no, no.\" But mast cells are located in your connective tissue, including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine. They can affect every system in the body, Afrin says, so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms Brynn experiences. You have to ask yourself, he says: \"Is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different, independent problems? Or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on?\" Of course, having a diagnosis didn't make living with mast cell disease any easier. In 2012, Brynn was admitted to the hospital 30 times. She started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful, violent muscle contractions that are \"scary to see and scary to experience.\" On multiple occasions, doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction.",

But because the ink has gone so deep, Mr Moffatt is unsure how many more sessions he needs to have. Painful: But because the ink has gone so deep, Mr Moffatt is unsure how many more sessions he needs to have . He said: 'I've got a long journey ahead of me to get them all off and I pressed it so deep in one that it's going to be very difficult to get it off.' Mr Moffatt, who also has a two-year-old daughter Kya with partner Rachael Higgins, 23, now wants to use his experience to highlight why people should not attempt to draw their own tattoos. He said: 'Once I've got them off, my job isn't done. We want to try and get a campaign going so people like me can't just go out and buy a gun with no questions asked. 'You shouldn't be able to go on the internet as a 15-year-old Joe Bloggs and buy one. I want to get the message out there that tattoos should only be done by professionals.' The owner of the Maria Patricia Tattoo Removals, where he is being treated, says Mr Moffatt's situation is a stark warning against the dangers of unregulated ink work. Maria said: 'There needs to be more regulation. People don't realise the dangers of the buying off tattoo guns and ink off the internet. 'Tom did just that and had to Google the instructions of how to use it. It might seem like a laugh with mates when you're drunk but it's not easy to fix the damage and people can be left with scarring if they're not careful. 'We're all for tattoos but people need to be aware they can wreck lives and make it difficult to get jobs.' Mr Moffatt, a machine operator working on NHS hospital equipment,\u00a0will appear in Tattoo Disasters UK, which airs each Tuesday, new and exclusive to Spike.",

The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.",

The passenger who made the awful discovery said the smell was so bad that it forced the operator to cancel the service from Lichfield Trent Valley to Longbridge. It plunged commuters into hours of misery as the act of vandalism on the Cross City line caused severe delays. A passenger made the awful discovery on a train travelling between Lichfield Trent Valley and Longbridge . Passenger Christopher Talbot told the Birmingham Mail he was heading to work on the 7:50am service on Thursday when he found  excrement in a newspaper on the floor. He said: \u2018As I sat down I saw a newspaper on the floor. I leaned over and noticed there was something inside it. \u2018It looked like poo basically. The smell was going through the carriage. These trains have toilets on.\u2019 The 52-year-old, who works as a cleaner at a school, said there was only one other passenger in the carriage, and he reported the incident to platform staff when he disembarked at Butlers Lane in Four Oaks. London Midland said that CCTV images of the culprit would be passed onto police for investigation . The service terminated at Birmingham New Street so that the carriage that was used as a toilet could be cleaned. Normal service resumed at about 9:30am. A Network Rail spokeswoman confirmed to MailOnline Travel that excrement was discovered inside a carriage. A spokesman for London Midland said the 'act of vandalism' was 'disgusting'. The service terminated at Birmingham New Street so that the carriage could be cleaned . He added: \u2018It was necessary for the train to be cleaned before we could continue to let passengers onto the service. \u2018I would like to apologise to our genuine passengers who experienced the disruption.\u2019 London Midland confirmed that CCTV images of the culprit, who fled the train, would be passed onto police for investigation. A British Transport Police spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel that it has no record of a formal complaint being filed. A similar incident occurred last month when a British Airways flight was forced to return to London after a foul odour emanated from an overflowing toilet. Passenger Abhishek Sachdev, a councillor who represents Potters Bar Parkfield, said the seven-hour flight to Dubai was aborted \u2018because of a smelly poo in the toilet'.",

The former Motherwell manager admitted being wowed by Murray Park in the days after he replaced Kenny McDowall. The club's \u00a312million training facility is a major improvement on the public pitches at Dalziel Park he was forced to make do with during his Steelmen stint. Stuart McCall insists he's loving life at Rangers despite losing heavily to Queen of the South . But along with the plush surroundings, McCall knows being manager of the Glasgow giants means he also has to cope with the kind of intense scrutiny levels he did not have to deal with at Fir Park. Not everyone is cut out for the strains of the job, as McDowall proved when he quit after posting just three wins from his 10-game spell as caretaker. The former Celtic youth coach found himself in charge just as the battle for power at Ibrox reached its bitterest point and at one stage admitted life at Rangers had 'taken its toll' on him. McCall has taken over a brighter picture following Dave King's boardroom victory and the 50-year-old former Light Blues midfielder seemed to shrug off the extra pressure during his first few weeks in charge as he led his side to three successive wins - including successes against Hearts and Hibs. Lewis Kidd (left) battles for the ball against Rangers' David Templeton in Queen of the South's victory . But the focus will have sharpened since Gers suffered their first defeat under his watch when they lost 3-0 to Queen of the South on Thursday. The Ibrox men will hope to shake that off come Sunday when they host Raith Rovers but McCall insists he will not let the job wear him down. He said: 'I've not really noticed a difference in intensity levels. I just love what I do out there on the training field. 'At this moment in time I don't feel any pressure whatsoever. Ian Black (left) and Kris Boyd in training as Rangers look to get back to winning ways and gain promotion .

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video . In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name . This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent . Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base . To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers. On her YouTube profile she writes:  'I use make-up to transform myself into famous celebrities and characters. 'It started out as a hobby 4 years ago and now I am here using this awesome platform to teach and entertain millions around the world.' Promise colours her lips in before adding a Mac lipstick on top - the make-up brand created a collection inspired by the film . Promise uses a pair of tweezers to place false eyelashes onto her eyelid . Her Facebook page states: 'I am not a professional make-up artist nor did take any lessons in it. I am purely self taught!' Along with Disney princesses, she's also transformed herself into the likes of Drake, Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson. In the four minute video Promise talks her viewers through the steps that she took to get her Maleficent look. She uses many products from Mac's Maleficent collection including the eye shadows and eyelashes. Here we look back at some of her other amazing looks...

Joselyn Alejandra Ni\u00f1o is believed to have been found stuffed in a beer cooler just over the Mexican border last Sunday. She gained notoriety in January when this picture began circulating online . The woman, who looks like she is in her late teens or early 20s, began operating under the name Rio Bravo. Cutting a slim physique and an almost innocent smile, she also donned a Kevlar jacket beneath a gold necklace. In the comments next to the striking image, people urged her to sell the gun and buy another TV while others prayed for her. A picture of her body laying next to a dead man and another woman was taken before another image was posted showing her dismembered body in the cooler.

According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege. A 24-year-old supermarket employee, Malian-born Lassana Bathily, was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from Coulibaly in the cold room. The hostage-taking was the culmination of three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The two brothers blamed for that attack, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed on January 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site. The terror attacks claimed the lives of 17 people and put France on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Ariana Williams reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

On Thursday, the Inverness defender was cleared to play in the Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk on May 30 after a charge of deliberate handball to deny Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths in last Sunday\u2019s semi-final was thrown out. In the aftermath of the 3-2 extra-time win, Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . His admission \u2013 backed by manager John Hughes \u2013 preceded the player being cited by the SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. That unprecedented move following a game in which a handball incident had gone unpunished, brought a warning from Jim Boyce, head of FIFA\u2019s referees committee, that a successful prosecution would open up a can of worms. Although such a scenario was avoided with the charge being kicked out, the furore surrounding the issue prompted the SFA go public on Friday with the tribunal panel\u2019s reasons. And it seems they accepted the preliminary argument of Inverness\u2019 legal representative that they weren\u2019t entitled to take the matter further. A statement read: \u2018Further to the judicial panel hearing on Friday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings\u2019 solicitor. \u2018In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . \u2018The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. \u2018It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.\u2019 The explanation raises questions as to whether McGlennan ought to have cited Meekings in the first place. Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded against Celtic . However, legal sources have told Sportsmail that the SFA\u2019s prosecutor is entitled to cite players even in such instances when officials have seen an \u2018incident\u2019 but have failed to spot an \u2018offence\u2019. Yet it appears that in Meekings\u2019 case, the panel concurred with his solicitor\u2019s argument that they were not entitled to take the matter further as the match officials had seen the incident. The matter is further confused by the fact that former Hearts striker Ryan Stevenson and ex-Motherwell keeper Darren Randolph were previously banned retrospectively for serious foul play as the referees in question had seen the \u2018incidents\u2019 but missed the \u2018offences\u2019 in question.",

The mobile X-ray scanner, heralded as the world\u2019s first \u2018airplane scanner\u2019, sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside. While the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated, the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety. Scroll down for video . Romanian company MB Telecom has revealed the Roboscan 2M Aeria. It uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes (shown) and look inside. The device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb. But the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet . The Roboscan 2M Aeria is being developed by Romanian company\u00a0MB Telecom (MBT). It costs \u20ac3 million (\u00a32.1 million, $3.2 million), reported\u00a0The Times, and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in Eastern Europe, where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes. On its website, MBT says the Aeria is \u2018the very first solution for aircraft security inspection.\u2019 It can scan planes from small private jets to medium-sized commercial airplanes. The company notes that, while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports, there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security. But with their device, the company says this \u2018gap\u2019 in aviation security can be plugged, and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes. The device can be used to detect weapons (shown) and other contraband in small or medium-sized jets that land at low-security airports . An operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane, although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted . There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. The first is the operating truck, from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane. Attached to this is a robotic arm with an X-ray generator at the end. The plane is then pulled forwards by a battery-operated tug over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane. The operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane, and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items. It is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb. One issue, though, is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits, even though Roboscan can examine these areas. \u2018You cannot touch it, but you can scan it,\u2019 said Radu Tudor of MBT at the Counter Terror Expo in London this week. There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. The first is the operating truck (shown), from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane . The plane is pulled forwards through the scanner by a battery-operated tug (shown) over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane .",

Now the Green party has set it to music, with a new election advert featuring David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage forming a bizarre pro-austerity boyband. The video, complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change, is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration. The video begins with 'David Cameron' playing a white grand piano, with 'Ed Miliband' looking on . It sees Mr Cameron entering a polling booth and telling voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys' The advert is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration . The song, Change The Tune, features comedians playing the four party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition. According to the Green party, the quartet 'sing in harmony about their shared love of austerity and fondness for fracking'. It sees Mr Cameron tell voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys'. The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition.' It also takes a swipe at the background of leading politicians, with the verse: 'The choice between us couldn't be clearer, Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya, Whether it's Trident or High Speed Two, The lesser of four evils is up to you.' Notably the video, which last 3minutes, 40 seconds, does not feature Green leader Natalie Bennett at all. With the party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition, the video is complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change . Dancing around a large pound sign, the four leaders are shown singing: 'Austerity! Austerity! Austerity!' Green party leader Natatlie Bennett said she wanted to show how\u00a0the Establishment parties 'have been singing from the same hymn sheet' The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition' She has suffered a series of difficult media appearances in recent weeks, including claiming people who join ISIS should not be criminalised, struggling to make her housing sums add up and admitting it could take decades to implement her 'citizen's income'. Despite the gaffes, the Green party has enjoyed a sharp rise in popularity in the last year and now boasts more members than both the Lib Dems and Ukip. Unveiling the new advert, Ms Bennett said: 'For many years the Establishment parties have been singing from the same hymn sheet. 'The Westminster consensus \u2013 which sees all other parties sign up to austerity economics, privatisation of our public services and inaction on climate change \u2013 is coming to an end. The Green Party is offering a real alternative to business-as-usual politics. 'We want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means bringing in a Living Wage of \u00a310 an hour by 2020 and fair taxes on rich individuals and Britain's biggest corporations. 'Voting Green on May 7th is a chance for people to play their part in breaking open the political harmony of the Establishment parties.'",

Tanguy Pepiot, a steeplechase runner for the University of Oregon, had a clear lead on his rival Meron Simon, who competes for the University of Washington. But at a track meet Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, a crowd of more than 3,000 people saw the distance evaporate after Pepiot raised his hands in pre-emptive joy, with less than 100m to go. Vanishing lead: Tanguy Pepiot, a runner for the University of Oregon, is pictured left celebrating his victory - and right after he has lost it all to the University of Washington's Meron Simon . Big gains: Pepiot, right, is pictured from track level raising his hands to excite the crowd - as Simon tears toward him from behind . The gesture seemed to sap some of his momentum, opening the way for Simon to speed towards the finish line, and beat him by a tenth of a second. The home crowd roared as Simon powered ahead - seemingly in an attempt to warn French-born Pepiot. But the warning came too late, and Simon flashed past, leaving Pepiot, who is in his senior year, to collapse, defeated. Simon's time, 8:57.86, exceeded his personal record by around 15 seconds. Speaking to the Eugene Register-Guard\u00a0after the contest, a newly-victorious Simon said: 'I thought he had me. Moment of truth: Simon is shown here edging ahead of Pepiot, whom he beat by a tenth of a second . Reconciliation: After celebrating his triumph, Simon headed back to help Pepiot up after he collapsed to the ground in defeat . 'I thought he was just so far ahead. Then I heard the crowd get crazy, and he started throwing his hands up. 'I was like, \"I don\u2019t think he knows I\u2019m coming\". I just went to the line and just raced.' After a justified victory celebration of his own, Simon doubled back to console his rival. Not long after, a defeated Pepiot told columnist Austin Meek: 'I think it was the first time it happened to me. I'll make sure it's the last time.' Personal best: Meron, pictured left at a different event, ran his best ever time in the 3,000m steeplechase. Meanwhile French-born Pepiot, right in a file photo, had pledged not to get cocky again .",

Ba Van Nguyen was able to fly a CH-47 Chinook, the largest helicopter in the South Vietnamese army, with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the South China Sea where they were all ultimately saved by the USS Kirk. This after Nguyen somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own. Scroll down for videos . Histo4ric:\u00a0Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter (above) on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975 . Saved: He flew towards the USS Kirk which was too small to allow the helicopter to land, and so he hoovered over as his family (daughter circled in red) safely jumped out . Helping hand: Sailors on the ship caught the family (above) as they jumped out . In an interview with CNN, some members of the family are revealing what happened on that historic day, and their lives in the years after. They were also part of the PBS special, The Last Days of Vietnam. On April 29, 1975, Nguyen moved his family to his mother-in-law's house, telling them he would be back the next day in the Chinook, and that they would hear him coming when he was close. 'If you hear a Chinook coming, get ready,' Nguyen told his wife. When he arrived later that morning, his family and a few friends got on - as gunfire from the communist forces grew louder and louder as they came closer to the city - and flew out towards the water. Shortly after however, they realized they were running low on fuel, and that is when Nguyen reached out to the Kirk asking for permission to land. 'I must land or crash into the sea,' Nguyen said. 'Please help us.' Bravery: Nguyen then flew back out to sea (above) and jumped from the helicopter . Safe: He managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel (above) when the plan crashed . Heading back: A motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea (above) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers . The Kirk however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter, which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard. And so it was decided that Nguyen would at least try and save his family. He hoovered over the ship as every passenger jumped onto the deck and were caught by sailors, including his wife and three young children. That is when he went back out to sea and managed to do the impossible and somehow pilot alone, get out of his suit and jump into the water seconds before the helicopter crashed and sent shrapnel flying everywhere. Seconds later, he appeared in the water, wearing nothing but his boxer shorts and a shirt. Hos one possession, some gold he had in his pocket, had fell out and sunk in the South China Sea. 'We couldn't figure out how he did it; he was a Houdini,' said Hugh Doyle, the chief engineering officer. A motorboat was sent out to retrieve him, and moments later he was reunited with his family. The Nguyen family would be part of the 30,000 South Vietnamese refugees ultimately rescued by the Kirk. 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said\u00a0Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk. Unbelievable: Nguyen somehow managed to operate the plane and it's intricate system (above) alone after everyone jumped . Over: 'It was a happy ending to a shi**y war,' said Kent Chipman, one of the sailors on the Kirk of Nguyen's (above) feat . That was just the beginning for Nguyen though, who now had to start over in America and try to support his family. He did not know the language and he had no money, but he was able to eventually land a job as a technician at Boeing in Seattle. According to his children he was strict, but also self-sufficient and proud, getting the family off government assistance after just a few months and encouraging hard work above all else. 'Your mother and I came to the United States with nothing but my drawers,' he would tell his children. 'Look at where we are today. We are not wealthy. But we are not poor.' He was reunited with the crew from the USS Kirk in 2009, finally revealing his identity after keeping it secret for years, and awarded an air medal for bravery. 'He was staring at me and I was staring at him. He knew and I just knew,' said Chipman of the emotional reunion, this despite the fact that Nguyen was already in the throes of Alzheimer's. It was then that his children were able to see just what their father had accomplished as footage of the day was shared by some of the men who had filmed the incident. Then, three years later, following a remarkable life, Nguyen passed away. He was 73-years-old.",

Soil underneath a slide at the park in the Toshima ward in the north-east of the Japanese capital, showed radiation readings of up to 480 microsieverts per hour. This is nearly half the recommended annual limit of exposure for a person. Danger: Japanese authorities detected an unusually high level of radiation around playground equipment in this Tokyo park (pictured) Safety: Authorities cordoned off the park after high levels of radiation were detected underneath a slide . It was not immediately clear why radiation levels were so high in the park, which opened two years after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Authorities believe that the radiation could be coming from something buried underneath the park. The playground has now been fenced off with an orange barricade. Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, members of the public should not be exposed to more than 1000 microsieverts per year. Japan has seen heightened concern over radiation since the 2011 failure of a nuclear plant in Fukushima following an earthquake and tsunami, which led to leaks of radioactive water. In the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks. Thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home in areas closest to Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear plant. Elsewhere, a drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office building this week. Clean up: Workers carry away a container after extremely high levels of radiation were detected in the park . Tests: Following two rounds of testing, officials found high levels of radiation on a section of the equipment .",

'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image.

The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath.

Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.' It is not known whether Gywneth's two children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, ten, and Moses, nine, will also be taking part in the challenge however, given the limited supply of food featured in her Twitter picture, it is thought the Shakespeare in Love star is going it alone this time around.",

Surveillance cameras caught the thief taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut. Thief: Surveillance cameras caught a thief (left) taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan (right) at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014 . Sullivan, who had lung cancer, was informed of the fraud while fighting for her life at\u00a0Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She died five days later. The 50-year-old had worked as a marketing executive for fashion designers Kimora Lee Simmons and Diane von Furstenberg. According to CBS New York, the suspect had Sullivan's Social Security number and a signed copy of her driver's license. Other documents she allegedly used were forged. Sullivan's family was, unsurprisingly, horrified by the news. 'I was just pretty violated and felt kind of helpless standing there with my sister and then knowing that there's some woman trying to clear out her bank account while she lays here fighting for her life,' her sister, Sarah Sullivan, told CBS New York. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut . The thief posed as Sullivan in Chase branches in two Long Island towns. A teller at one of the locations caught the fake documents but the suspect fled before authorities could be called . 'I just want to make sure nobody else goes through what my family's been going through the last couple of months.' In the weeks following Sullivan's death, her sister discovered new store and credit card bills in Sullivan's mail . 'I've had to fax death certificates and affidavits to all of the creditors and fly in to meet with the police and lots of other stuff I didn't need to deal with while I'm mourning my sister's death,' she said. Detectives from New Haven were scheduled to speak with a New York State Police investigator Thursday afternoon, according to city police spokesman Officer David Hartman. Detectives in the New Haven Police Department's Financial Crimes Division were shown a picture of the suspect and none are aware of any connection to open New Haven cases at this time. The 50-year-old had worked as a marketing executive for fashion designers Kimora Lee Simmons and Diane von Furstenberg .",

Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, had spent his entire life in foster care after\u00a0his mother gave birth to him behind bars. Three years after his emotional plea at St Mark Missionary Baptist Church in St Petersburg he has finally found a permanent home with the woman who first met him as a seven-year-old when she became his caseworker. Scroll down for video . Davion Only, 16, who captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea for a\u00a0family to 'love him forever', has been adopted by his old caseworker Connie Bell Going (right) and her family . Davion plays on the Xbox in his bedroom with his soon-to-be adopted mom Connie sitting behind him together with her daughter Carley, 17, and her adopted son, Taylor, 14 . Throughout Davion's search for a family, and his years in the system, Connie Bell Going, had been by his side. On April 22 she will officially become Davion's mother.\u00a0She admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it. Since August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14. Then in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. Since then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges. 'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told\u00a0the\u00a0Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' Davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.' He then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.' Davion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker,\u00a0Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire life . Davion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a\u00a0family to 'love him forever' Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'. Millions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family. That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system. After Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months. 'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said. Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida. Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year. Davion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children . Going says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone. Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy. 'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said.\u00a0'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?' For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear. The 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier. From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor. Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July . Davion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their\u00a0birthdays,\u00a0which\u00a0fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his\u00a0three\u00a0siblings\u00a0and signed the court papers. After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December .",

The broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of Mr Engel, which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed, was carried out by forces associated with President Bashar-al Assad. But Mr Engel has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a Sunni group who had tried to convince their victims that they were Shi-ite rebels affiliated to the Government. Scroll down for video . NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel (centre) was taken captive with Turkey reporter Aziz Akyavas (left) and photographer John Kooistra (right) and were convinced by their captors they had been taken by forces related to President Bashar al-Assad, but they may have been Sunni rebels instead . A statement posted on the NBC News site said: 'The group that kidnapped us put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite Shabiha militiamen.\u00a0The group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances.' The statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight, as they were told, this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes. Instead the captives may just have been handed over. The statement added: 'We have not been able to get a definitive account of what happened that night. But based on all of our reporting, it is clear that we were kidnapped by a criminal gang for money and released for propaganda purposes. 'This, of course, does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous. It does, however, underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside Syria.' Mr Engel and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the New York Times raised questions over the attackers' identities. They suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a Sunni criminal element of the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army and known for taking hostages. The New York Times claimed that NBC executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers' identities during and after Mr Engel was taken. Mr Engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces . But immediately after his release Mr Engel appeared on Today and in a Vanity Fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group, government militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. He made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors, which included that they had been rescued by Sunni rebels. The paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the Assad regime. Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra, were taken hostage on December 13, 2012, while reporting in Syria. The foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a Syrian rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see Iranian and Lebanese prisoners being held by rebels. Syrians run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the Bustan Al-Qasr district of Aleppo . They were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound, blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes. The kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress GPS signal, which informed NBC exactly where they were. \u00a0NBC was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world, also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location. Engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall behind them. It read: \u2018Or will burn.\u2019 A statement published by NBC said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes . During the five days they were held Mr Engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot, and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last. He claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers.\u00a0As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. On the fifth night they were loaded, while blindfolded, into a van. They were told they would be handed over to military forces in  Foua. As they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor. Engel has since said, in light of the new information, this may have been staged to convince them they were rescued rather than handed over. Engel, who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's chief foreign correspondent in 2008.",

Rangers are in the drop zone of the Barclays Premier League with 28 points as they prepare for a London derby at home to West Ham. 'If you win three games you're probably going to stay up,' said Ramsey. 'As long as we're above the line come the end of May we'll be happy. I just care if we win. I just take care of our own game. If we don't get good results it doesn't matter what they do. Queens Park Rangers boss Chris Ramsey believes his side will stay in the Premier League with three wins . Clint Hill reacts after QPR conceded a late goal against Chelsea to lose 1-0 at Loftus Road . Ramsey spoke of his dismay at the nature of the late defeat by Chelsea in their last game . 'We know the enormity of the task ahead but you can only plan and prepare as best you can and what happens happens. We understand there is pressure in these last few games. I can't say I don't feel pressure but it depends on how you deal with it.' He believes QPR's chances of achieving these victories from games against West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester will hinge on their an ability to kick the habit of conceding late goals, like the one which turned a draw into defeat on their last outing against Chelsea. 'It is down to a lack of continued concentration,' said Ramsey. 'The managers of other teams near the bottom would say the same. 'Not many teams are getting slaughtered but the quality at the top end is why they're there. We're not happy with late goals. We need to stop conceding those late goals. Ramsey's side face West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester to close the season . Ramsey (right) wants QPR to improve their defensive concentration in order to stay in the Premier League . 'We were quite frustrated at the end of the last game as we played well but didn't get a positive result. We had good form and momentum and we'd have liked to have played straight away. 'I didn't get over it quickly. We had a game-plan and we didn't do it until the end. It was more for the players who ran their legs off. When you're dealing with the players and coaches of the class of Chelsea you have to be on it and we weren't.'",

Because, according to her, she has cancer. That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.",

Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the sixth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I recall when a hard man could take no more... THE NO MAS FIGHT . New Orleans, Louisiana . November 25, 1980 . Sugar Ray Leonard v Roberto Duran . The first two of the three fights between the Sugar Man and Hands of Stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing, with Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler engaging each other in some of the ring\u2019s epic battles. By way of a preview, Leonard had defeated the previous \u2014 and equally great \u2014 Felix Trinidad to win the world welterweight title. Sugar Ray Leonard celebrates after Roberto Duran quit in their fight in Louisiana in November 1980 . Leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the Panamanian in the second fight . GEORGE FOREMAN V MUHAMMAD ALI . October 30, 1974, Kinshasa, Zaire . JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . MUHAMMAD ALI V JOE FRAIZIER . October 1, 1975, Quezon City, Philippines . In his first defence, Sugar Ray had been contentiously outpointed by Duran in Montreal\u2019s Olympic Stadium. So confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision. That was changed to unanimous in Duran\u2019s favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147. There was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of Duran and only two for Leonard \u2014 with 10 even. That was described as \u2018a monument to indecision\u2019. Come the inevitable rematch eight months later, in the Louisana Superdome in New Orleans on November 25, 1980, controversy was to be replaced by disbelief. Leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the Panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out. Second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability, especially his speed and movement. Duran became frustrated as Leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches . After being caught flush in the face in the eighth round, Duran turned his back and said 'No mas' \u2018The whole fight I was moving. Moving. Then voom, I\u2019d snap his head back with a jab. Voom, I\u2019d snap it back again. He\u2019d try to get me on the ropes. I\u2019d pivot, spin off and pow, come under with a punch.\u2019 So it went for more than seven rounds, with Duran becoming increasingly frustrated. In the eighth Leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in Duran\u2019s face. There had been a moment earlier when Leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside. Just before the bell Duran turned his back and walked to his corner, waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee: \u2018No mas.\u2019 Spanish for no more. Leonard celebrates after his opponent quit, and said it was more of an achievement than knocking Duran out . The result stunned the watching world, and it took three years for Duran to rebuild his reputation . The watching world was stunned. Here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible. Clearly he felt humiliated. Sensing the reaction Duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in. But his manager Carlos Eleta said: \u2018He always eats like that before a fight. He quit because he was embarrassed.\u2019 Duran had been a national icon in Panama and there was anger on the streets at his action. Television commercials featuring him were taken off. It took three years for Duran to restore his high place in his country\u2019s esteem. He did so on June 16, 1983, his 32nd birthday, by knocking out Davey Moore in Las Vegas to win the world light-middleweight title. Rejoicing returned to the streets. Leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide, thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title. But Sugar Ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing Duran to say No Mas. He said: \u2018To me, making Roberto Duran to quit was better than knocking him out.\u2019",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nOne of Britain's top entrepreneurs has unveiled a new plan to build a block of flats worth as much as \u00a32billion on the site of an ugly multi-storey car park. John Caudwell, the founder of Phones4U, bought the Audley Street garage in Mayfair, central London for \u00a3155million in order to knock it down and build a high-end housing complex. The new apartment block will contain five townhouses, three penthouses, a mews home and 21 more luxury flats, rivalling properties such as One Hyde Park for the title of the world's most desirable living space. Luxury: Audley Square House is set to be a complex of houses, luxury flats and penthouses in Mayfair, central London . Contrast: Most of the plot is currently taken up by an ugly parking garage which is set to be knocked down by owner John Caudwell . But it could face trouble getting planning permission - as VIP neighbours may object to the building works needed to build four levels of basements as well as nine storeys above the ground. Each townhouse and penthouse will have its own gym and swimming pool, while the penthouses will have dedicated lifts to ensure their owners' privacy. Entrepreneur: The Phones4U founder, pictured with his partner Claire Johnson, is known as a prolific investor in Mayfair property . The development's communal facilities will include a 15-metre swimming pool, a business centre for holding meetings, a gym, spa and cinema and games room. Plans for the ambitious complex were submitted to Westminster Council this week after being put together by US architects RAMSA, which beat 30 rivals to the job. Audley Square House is regarded as a 'super prime' scheme - with one agent saying it could reach \u00a310,000 per sq/ft, valuing it at \u00a32billion in total. Becky Fatemi, director of Rokstone estate agents, said Audley Square House was 'one of the most exciting residential projects ever unveiled in London'. She estimated it would sell for \u00a35,500-\u00a37,000 per sq/ft, rising as high as \u00a310,000 per sq/ft in the next few years. Ms Fatemi said: 'John Caudwell's visionary proposals will replace an unsightly multi-storey concrete car park at 5 Audley Square and convert it into a super-prime residential project. 'The Audley Square project will create a new luxury village for Mayfair and will rival One Hyde Park as London's best luxury address.' Susan Cohen from Mayfair-based Pastor Real Estate said: 'Speculation on plans to develop the Audley Square car park have been going almost as long as I've been in Mayfair, long before the \u00a3150 million deal to purchase the site in 2011. 'There have been many twists and turns, initially refused by the planning officer, Westminster council then overturned this, now the plans have been revised and resubmitted. 'Whatever happens, due to the scale of investment already ploughed into this I don't doubt the finished development will be one of the most super-prime schemes in Mayfair.' Desirable: The complex is set to fetch as much as \u00a32billion in total when it goes on to the market, according to one estate agent . Plan: This map shows how the development will include five townhouses as well as a courtyard garden . Towering: The property will reach nine storeys, as well as four basement levels to be excavated below ground . Mark Tunstall of Tunstall Property added: 'Mayfair is becoming increasingly residential as commercial leases granted after World War II on previously residential addresses come to an end and those properties are reinstated to their original use. 'Yet where it has lagged behind other areas such as Knightsbridge and Belgravia is in its provision of 21st century full-service apartment buildings. 'What Mayfair has lacked until now is a building to rival One Hyde Park and 199 Knightsbridge. Audley Square is set to be a game changer.' Mr Caudwell, 62, has previously described the location as being 'the best site in the world but with some of the ugliest buildings', and promised his stone-clad development will be 'very beautiful'. Contrast: This image shows how the huge building will tower over the street it is on, compared to the modest development there now . Stylish: Mr Caudwell claims that many buildings in the area are very ugly and is keen to restore the district's elegance . Overhaul: The vista will be almost unrecognisable when the complex is built - but it has to get planning permission first . He does not plan to include any affordable housing as part of the complex - and will instead pay Westminster Council more than \u00a38million in compensation. If the property is sold for its maximum price, the Treasury could gain as much as \u00a3100million in stamp duty. However, Ms Fatemi warned that powerful locals might not be happy with the years of building works which would be likely to ensue in the area. 'The project will have a lower ground floor and four basement levels, this will be a major engineering scheme,' she said. 'The neighbours are powerful and include the Embassy of Qatar, the Dorchester Hotel and very wealthy apartment owners who will expect the site construction to be managed to the highest levels to ensure no noise or construction impact and they will expect constantly clean roads.' Map: Another projection of how the finished development will look which was submitted to Westminster Council planners . Eyesore: The current car park is an undistinguished modern building with a monolithic brick frontage . Mr Caudwell has previously made a number of significant investments in Mayfair - he is currently spending millions on converting two houses into a single mega-mansion, and he also owns the house next to Audley Square, which has been rented out for \u00a315,000 per week. A spokesman for the development project declined to comment on the newly revealed plans. Billionaire: Mr Caudwell founded Phones4U and sold his business for \u00a31.5billion . John Caudwell rose from humble beginnings to become one of the wealthiest men in Britain thanks to the Phones4U business empire. He left school before taking his A-levels and worked as an apprentice at Michelin - but while working at the tyre firm, he started a mail-order business selling clothing to motorbike fans. Mr Caudwell was living in a caravan when he and his brother cooked up a plan to sell mobile phones, then considered an expensive luxury with huge profit margins. In 1987 He bought 26 phones from Motorola and took eight months to sell them all, but that turned out to be the origins of a company which would help define the burgeoning mobile market. Nearly 20 years later, Mr Caudwell cashed out by selling the last of his businesses for \u00a31.5billion, and at that point he became a noted philanthropist, giving to causes such as the NSPCC and the Bomber Command memorial. He has a son with his partner Claire Johnson, as well as four other children from previous relationships. Last year his son Rufus revealed that he was struggling with agoraphobia, and finds it almost impossible to leave the house. As well as his properties in Mayfair, Mr Caudwell owns 50-room Broughton Hall in Staffordshire, where he is currently building a private miniature railway to transport him and his guests around the estate.",

The veteran host was attempting to warm up the studio audience ahead of his show on Monday when he made the off-colour gag. Letterman had just opened up questions to the floor, and fielded the first query of the night from a college employee, reported the\u00a0New York Post. They asked what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates. Letterman, who was in 2009 forced to admit to string of affairs, said:\u00a0'Treat a lady like a wh\u2013e, and a wh\u2013e like a lady.' But the joke received a frosty\u00a0reception from the shocked crowd. After being met with stunned silence, the host attempted to recover by offering further advice to graduates to 'eat salad' and 'always be nice'. However, several audience members at the Ed Sullivan Theater were furious over the sexist joke. Retired Jerry Stockton, from Virginia, called it 'disrespectful to women' while another, who would not be named, said it had been an 'odd choice' for the first joke of the evening. The gag is thought to have been a reference to a saying by 1930s screenwriter Wilson Mizner. Scroll down for video . Joe Logan, 41, from Pennsylvania, told the New York Post:\u00a0'Younger people watch his show. We already live in a culture that objectifies women, it's not right to make a joke like that.' A Letterman spokesman said he could not 'confirm the accuracy' of Monday's failed joke and would not comment further. But a source close to the show insisted 'It got a big laugh.' Letterman carried on with the show which had guests including John Travolta and Amy Schumer, star of her eponymous Comedy Central show, 'Inside Amy Schumer.' Old friends: David thanked John for being his friend over the decades during Monday's show. It was during a Monday warm up that he made the gag . The Grease actor, 61, had tried to bring his son Ben on to meet his 'old friend' Letterman but the nervous youngster had fled the stage into his mother's arms. The host later offered some advice to Schumer and instructed her to 'do something now that you'll regret.' So the comedienne immediately lifted her dress and flashed... her surfing scar to a relieved-looking Letterman. In October 2009, the veteran host of the Late Show had been forced to admit to a string of affairs live on air  by a blackmailing producer. The host made the shocking revelation on his show that he had cheated on his wife, Regina Lasko, whom he had only married that March. He made the confession after becoming the victim of an extortion plot concocted by a then-CBS producer, Robert Halderman, who demanded $2 million in exchange for his silence over the affairs. Letterman is now planning to retire from the show after more than 20 years of hosting on May 20. Good times: David rubbed his forehead while Amy cracked up after he told her to do something she'd regret .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nI conducted a poll on my radio show recently, and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe Manchester United will win the title next season. Is it heart ruling the head among the United faithful? Or is there a genuine belief that serial winner Louis van Gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again? Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Van Gaal poses for pictures with United fans at the training ground during a day for the club's foundation . Van Gaal (pictured talking to fans) is starting to assert himself at the United after a stuttering start . If he is to take United back to the very top, he\u2019ll need more than Memphis Depay. I\u2019ve already established in this column recently that Van Gaal is a great, and he is a winner. I love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career. The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time \u2013 just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department \u2013 his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don\u2019t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it\u2019s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He\u2019s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he\u2019s dealt with Van Gaal\u2019s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I\u2019ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019s a winner and a leader \u2013 perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view \u2013 Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can\u2019t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney\u2019s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate \u2013 for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season \u2013 he\u2019s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble \u2013 European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that\u2019s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV\u2019s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It\u2019s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?",

United have lost seven of their last nine matches in all competitions, drawing the other two, while their last league victory was way back on January 24 against Motherwell. However, Hartley is refusing to believe that will make his side's job any easier as they attempt to register their first win in a derby this season at the fourth attempt. Paul Hartley is not reading too much into Dundee United's recent slide ahead of Wednesday's  derby game . Hartley said: 'They've still got good players. 'We're under no illusion about the talent they have throughout the squad. 'We've seen it throughout the season - and in games against us, in particular. We know they've got players who can hurt you anywhere. We need to be focused on what we can do.' Dundee are without a win in three matches themselves, following up their defeat to Ross County with 1-1 draws against Aberdeen and Inverness. Dundee Utd's Nadir Ciftci scores his side's equalising goal from the penalty spot against Ross County . Callum Morris celebrates his goal during the Scottish League Cup match against Aberdeen . That has left them in seventh place in the table on 41 points, five behind fourth-placed United and two adrift of Hamilton in sixth. Hartley said: 'We're trying to look at getting as many points before the split, try to get into that top six. 'We're not far off but we know we need to win some games. 'If we get a result in the derby, it takes us a couple of points behind United, yes. But the main thing for us is trying to catch our nearest opponent.' Dundee Utd's John Souttar battles for the ball with Liam Boyce during their game at Tannadice . Despite not having won since February, Hartley believes his players can still take confidence into Wednesday's match after taking points off top-three sides Aberdeen and Inverness. He said: 'We're on a pretty good run. 'Our results recently have been decent against some good teams in the league. So all credit to the lads for that. We want to keep that going and derby games are always special. If you win, it can give everyone a great lift. Dundee United's Cifti in action with Aberdeen's Peter Pawlett during the Scottish Communities League Cup . 'We know what's at stake and we want to finish the season as strongly as possible. 'Our punters will be really looking forward to it and we would love to give them the three points.' Dundee defender James McPake will be given until the last minute to prove his fitness ahead of the derby after being sent for a scan on his knee. Hartley said: 'He caught his knee in training on Thursday, did very little on Friday and felt OK throughout the Inverness game. He just landed awkwardly from a corner.'",

Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill Thursday that will legalize low-THC cannabis oil for certain \"medication-resistant epilepsies,\" while creating an infrastructure, registration process and research program for the drug. (THC is the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana.) The bill is dubbed Haleigh's Hope Act. Haleigh, who has been the face of the bill, was having hundreds of seizures a day and the five potent drugs meant to control them weren't making life better for the little girl. Janea Cox said in a March 2014 interview that she made the difficult decision to move her daughter to Colorado, where medical marijuana is legal, in hopes of saving her life. \"She was maxed out,\" Cox said. \"She'd quit breathing several times a day, and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications.\" 10 diseases marijuana could affect . Cox had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help, but it wasn't available in Georgia. So a week after hearing a doctor's diagnosis that Haleigh might not live another three months, she and Haleigh packed up and moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, Haleigh began a regimen of cannabis oil: four times a day and once at night. \"Every time she smiled I knew we did the right thing, because we hadn't seen her smile in three years,\" Cox said. \"Now she's thriving, she's healthy, she's happy, and they're absolutely shocked at the difference. So I think we've turned some nonbelievers into believers of cannabis oil.\" Deal is apparently one of those believers, signing HB1 on Thursday and opening the door for the use of cannabis oil to treat certain medical conditions. The bill will benefit not only people who suffer from chronic seizure disorders, but it also will allow patients to receive in-state treatment. To obtain a license in Georgia, you will need to have a specific covered condition, such as acute seizures. \"For the families enduring separation and patients suffering pain, the wait is finally over,\" Deal said Thursday. \"... Now, Georgia children and their families may return home while continuing to receive much-needed care.\" For Cox, it's a blessing \"to be able to come back home, and with Haleigh's medicine, it's done wonders for her -- going from 200-plus seizures a day and on her deathbed to a smiling, happy girl who says words now and looks us in the eye and lets us know she's in there.\" She added, \"Colorado has been good to us, but Georgia's home. Georgia's definitely home.\" With medical marijuana legal in nearly half the states, doctors are increasingly studying what effect the drug has on various ailments. While Georgia's law is specific to a handful of conditions, medical marijuana laws in states such as California permit marijuana use for an array of ailments. But as states rewrite their regulations, federal law remains the same: Marijuana is illegal to grow, sell or use for any purpose. Under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" To backers of reform, it presents a Catch-22: Marijuana is restricted, in large part, because there is scant research to support medical uses, yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions.",

Mr Gibbins and his friends were at The Beachcomber Hotel in Toukley on the Central Coast, NSW on Sunday night before they went to a nearby eatery where he was stabbed in the chest. While investigations continue, police have charged a 20-year-old man with murder of the talented football player. Scroll down for video .

Detective Inspector David Waddell says police are investigating whether the earlier incident involving a woman is linked to the fatal knife attack outside the local pizza shop. It was shortly after midnight when emergency services found Mr Gibbins and his 25-year-old friend with serious stab wounds at about 12.10am from the alleged random attack. The 28-year-old Wyong Roos rugby league club player was treated at the scene by paramedics before he went into cardiac arrest but later died at Gosford Hospital.

He was refused bail and appeared in Wyong Local Court on Tuesday. Brooks was remanded in custody until May, news.com.au reports. A friend became 'victim number two' when he tried to help fatally injured Mr Gibbins. The 25-year-old also suffered stab wounds during the confrontation and is in hospital undergoing surgery. Family and friends have paid their respect to a 'top bloke' who loved travelling, sports and parties . This comes as grieving family and friends have taken to social media to pay tribute to Mr Gibbins. Pictures from Mr Gibbins Facebook account paints a 'top bloke' who got along with everyone and loved travelling, partying and going to festivals and sporting events. Mr Gibbins, who works as a car spray painter, has prompted an outpouring grief from family, friends, colleagues and rugby team mates on his Facebook account. One friend posted on Facebook: 'RIP gibbo such a lovely friend , it's clear the amazing impact you made on everybody's life, rest easy xx' A rugby team mate wrote: 'Rest easy mate, was great to have played with and against you. A true gentleman that has obviously touched many.' Another said: 'RIP My heart goes out to all your family and everyone that knew you. You were an amazing person.' A school friend said: 'RIP Gibbo .....will always remember the \"lolly salad\" you made for me in primary school in your backyard, as our \"date\" ....only the good die young buddy xx.' While another friend wrote: 'You have left us way to early mate..Thoughts go out to the Gibbins family. RIP Gibbo' The 28-year-old was treated at the scene by paramedics before he went into cardiac arrest but later died . Chief Inspector Rodney Peet said at the time that police had not been able to pinpoint the catalyst for the confrontation. 'The victim was there, he was either chatting or waiting for some food, after the establishment across the road closed,' he told AAP. 'Then almost spontaneously this other gentleman has come up and stabbed him in the chest.' The offender fled the scene and police haven't found a weapon.

On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto\u2019s most famous son. Luis Suarez will be at the Parc des Princes tonight, forming one part of football\u2019s most famous three-man attack, looking to fire Barcelona into the Champions League semi-finals. Usually when they reach this stage, Barcelona do not make any mistakes. Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country. Edinson Cavani prepares for Paris Saint-Germain's quarter-final clash with Barcelona . PSG train at Camp-des-Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris . Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend . Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League\u2019s last eight, Cavani \u2013 a player known as El Matador \u2013 must torment the stars from Catalonia. The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over? To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc\u2019s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity. Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday. PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides in on Oscar during PSG's second round clash at Chelsea last month . Ibrahimovic is shown the red card for his challenge on Oscar to leave PSG up against it . Ibrahimovic trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona . It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao). Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani\u2019s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game. Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG\u2019s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France. \u2018I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,\u2019 said Cavani. \u2018Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me. \u2018The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.\u2019 Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season \u2013 he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates \u2013 it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage. That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic\u2019s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question, while Veratti is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in Europe but, without them, PSG need their man from Salto to sparkle. Their prospects depend on him. Louis van Gaal is considering a move for Cavani after seeing Radamel Falcao struggle this season . Cavani is one of the highest-paid players in the world after moving to Paris from Serie A side Napoli . Cavani will come up against Luis Suarez, who was born in the same town, in the first leg in Paris .",

Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a \"dead mall\" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. \"It's been a big change. It's a clear modernization,\" said David Carr, an English teacher from the United States who is living in Dongguan with his wife Danae, also a teacher. \"We come here at least once a month now.\" Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. But most of the unoccupied units, along with halls and walkways are under renovation. Even on a Saturday, it's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack-hammering and sawing. Ms Shu, head of New South China Mall's marketing unit, told CNN that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring, when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants. \"All construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in May,\" she said, declining to give her full name. \"We expect that from May, we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops.\" She said she couldn't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media. Ms Ye, head of investments, confirmed that \"business is really great,\" but would not comment further. Dutch retail chain Spar, which has expanded its supermarket to two floors, explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall's \"upgrading and retrofitting program.\" There are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall. When I spoke to her, Huang Haiyan, a young Chinese woman, was just two days away from opening a little caf\u00e9 called \"Miss & H\" in one of the passage ways being renovated. Sitting on the sidewalk outside the caf\u00e9, she and her partners were busy washing up cups, classes and plates ahead of the big day. \"I'm so excited!\" she said, showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when I last visited the mall two years ago. \"You must come, my coffee is the best in China!\" The area around the previously run-down Arc de Triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes. In January, a globe shaped IMAX-style cinema was launched at the outdoor square. One of the more eye-catching new sources of entertainment is a role-playing amusement center for children called Myrules World. Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. It's hard to believe how rapid the change has been. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. \"Many large malls (and residential construction) in China.... are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class,\" he said. \"What is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to (the much larger) bulk of middle-class Chinese.\" And, he says, other developments that were once labeled \"ghost cities\" have gone on to thrive. \"One to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments, so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional,\"Jackson said. Despite its retrofitting program, the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly. Most of Dongguan's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. The town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in China or to Southeast Asia where wages are lower. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. In March, prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. In 2007, the mall changed name from \"South China Mall\" to \"New South China Mall, Living City\" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city .",

Ms King shocked and intrigued the Australian public when she entered into a relationship with Thompson, who was twice her age, while he was also involved with Leona \u2013 who is nicknamed Le. The 60-year-old\u2019s first meeting with Thompson was when she was 15 years old Sydney school girl, and has now revealed the salacious details of their 15-year affair and unconventional arrangement. Scroll down for video . Bunkie King, 60, has revealed how her three-way relationship with Australian actor Jack Thompson and her sister worked . Ms King, also appeared with Thompson in 1975 movie Scobie Malone, had a 15-year affair with the womanising actor . Speaking with A Current Affair about her book, Somebody I Used to Know: Love, Loss and Jack Thompson, Ms King said she decided to pen a novel during an argument with her son. At one point, he shouted: 'I'm not proud that my mother had sex with her sister.' This was the moment Ms King realised there were many misconceptions about her relationship with the womanising actor. 'That really shocked me because that wasn't our relationship,' she said. 'It never entered my head [that's what people thought], so I put it down warts and all.' Ms King, who has two children with her ex-husband, also revealed how she shared one man with her sister, 20. A young Bunkie King pictured here with her sister Leona - nicknamed Le - and Jack Thompson . Le (pictured left) was 20 years old when she started a relationship with the Australian actor . Jack pictured in 1980 (left) and 2013 (right), was written about under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', when he told a newspaper he felt 'like a bone being fought over by two dogs' But from the start the siblings made it clear they were not going to sleep with him in the same bed. When Ms King first moved in with Le and Thompson she was 'allocated one night a week' with the actor. But then they relocated to Collaroy - on Sydney's North Shore - and the sisters would see him on alternating nights. Ms King said she had never close to Le and there were times where she felt her sister, who she is now estranged from, wished she had Thompson all to herself. But it was all or nothing with Thompson, who starred in Spyforce - an action series following Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II. 'I was happy for whatever crumbs came off the table. It did cause problems with jealousy and things like that. I don't think either of us would have chosen it that way,' Ms King said. Cleo magazine featured him reclined naked on a sofa catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight . Talking to\u00a0New Idea, Ms King said their relationship in many ways was 'quite old-fashioned'. 'We had separate bedrooms. He was just sleeping with both of us,' she said. In her interview with ACA, Ms King said her relationship was not a 'unique situation'. 'It is in western society but it's not a unique situation for a man to have more than one wife,' she said. 'In western society, a man generally speaking has a wife and a mistress or maybe a couple of mistresses.' But despite his commitment to two women, Ms King claims Thompson still had time to be unfaithful to her and Le. She said what hurt her the most about his alleged infidelities was the fact he was not open, honest and upfront about it. Ms King also revealed her sister did not know about her regular afternoon visits from Thompson at their mother's house when he started to court her. The visits in the 1970s increased  to three a week and, after months of spending time together, she fell hopelessly in love knowing he was with Le. Ms King has revealed in her memoirs how, as a virgin, she struggled to dampen her feelings for the blond tanned hunk and desperately craved his love even after her sister caught them kissing. Heyday: The actor, pictured centre (moustache), starred alongside David Bowie (right) in 1983 movie Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence . Seventies hit: The star (right) was catapulted to fame for the series Spyforce,\u00a0based on the adventures of Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II . Ms King writes: 'One night, he and I are kissing and cuddling in their bedroom when Le [Leona] bursts in the door yelling, \"What the hell are you doing?\" 'He jumps up off the bed and tries to calm her down. I bolt out of the room, down the stairs, through the front door and out into the street. 'I know there's something wrong with what we've been doing. He's obviously Le's boyfriend and I feel bad for her, but I don't know how to give him up.' It was the same for Jack too and, with his popularity at its height in the mid-1970s, the Wake In Fright star bought a rambling farm in the hills above Coffs Harbour, on the NSW mid-north coast, and convinced the sisters to share an 'open' and 'honest' relationship with him. New Idea magazine is on sale now . They moved in together, Ms King confined to the smaller room, while Leona shares the master bedroom with the actor, now dubbed 'Jack The Lady Killer' by the media. In her book, the 60-year-old also speaks frankly about her drug use, ranging from marijuana to acid to heroin. But she did not classify her drug use as 'hardcore'. 'Hardcore to me is someone who is basically mainlining. It was the 60s and the 70s,' Ms King said. During the early years of their relationship, Cleo magazine featured Thompson reclined on a sofa in a pose emulating a classic nude, Titian's Venus d'Urbino, catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight. In 1972, Ms King evealed she fell pregnant for the first time, having forgotten to take the Pill, and underwent the first of three terminations over 15 years. As Jack's fame grew, journalists clamoured for details about the nature of his threesome relationship and in October 1974, he granted Sydney's Daily Telegraph an\u00a0interview. Published under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', he claimed that he\u00a0occasionally\u00a0felt 'like a bone being\u00a0fought over by two dogs.' The truth, however, no doubt lies somewhere in between. Ms King says a serious showdown in Spain forced her to finally flee and maintains throughout her 15 years as Jack's lover, she never knew if she was genuinely wanted or was 'just an interloper.' Today she works in nursing and is divorced with a son Stephan, 17, and daughter, and lives a quiet life south of Sydney. And for his part, Jack remains with Leona, with whom he shares a son Billy, and the pair lead a reclusive life in\u00a0Ulong in New South Wales.",

The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'",

The Stoke City midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the Barclays Premier League\u2019s strike of the season. David Beckham did it against Wimbledon in August 1996, as did Wayne Rooney against West Ham last March. There was Xabi Alonso in 2006 and Maynor Figueroa three years later, too. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Yet this was different. It was not a hit and hope. It was not a lob. This was a direct shot from deep inside Adam\u2019s own half which fooled one of the world\u2019s greatest goalkeepers \u2014 and Adam meant it. Sportmail\u2019s Jamie Redknapp agreed. \u2018This is better than Beckham, more audacious than Rooney\u2019s last season, This is one of the best strikes we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s an absolutely incredible piece of play by Charlie Adam. \u2018You categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals, but that was a piece of genius. To even try it is brilliant.\u2019 Even by the standards those at Stamford Bridge are used to seeing week in, week out, this was special. Particularly because it came from an unexpected source, from a \u2018bloke who looks like a bus driver\u2019, as former English cricket captain Freddie Flintoff colourfully put it. Nineteen years ago, when Beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line, he did so wearing the wrong footwear. The Manchester United great beat Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan wearing custom-made boots embroidered with \u2018Charlie\u2019 on the tongue \u2014 adidas sending Beckham a pair which were actually intended for Rangers attacking midfielder Charlie Miller. Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game . David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . Chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the Premier League. Liverpool were the first and have now scored 102. Miller never got his boots as they were retired, turned into a museum piece, having helped Beckham towards his first of 115 England caps less than three weeks later against Moldova. From one Scottish Charlie to another, Adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from Stamford Bridge, but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool midfielder as it was for Beckham. Yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net, Adam disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original. \u2018The manager kept saying to me, \u201ccome in the middle of the pitch\u201d, to try to get on the ball,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018I\u2019m not a winger, I\u2019m not a wide left midfielder, I don\u2019t have the pace to go in behind so I\u2019ve seen an opening, I\u2019ve seen the goalie off his line and I thought, \u201cwhy not do it at a place like Chelsea?\u201d 'I\u2019ve seen the goalie back-pedalling and I was praying it would go in. I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my career.\u2019 From Spain\u2019s Marca to Italy\u2019s La Gazzetta dello Sport, the goal has been admired worldwide. One man who does not want to see it again, however, is Jose Mourinho. It left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, yet even the Chelsea manager can admire a wonder-goal when one comes along, as much as it hurts to admit it. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had to admit that Adam's goal was a strike of the highest quality . Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . \u2018It was a fantastic goal, every player in the world would like to score a goal like that,\u2019 Mourinho said. \u2018Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi to all these brilliant players. Not all of them did score that goal in their careers.\u2019 Maradona, Messi, and Adam. Unlike the Argentinian greats, he is known more for his heavy tackling, as Gareth Bale found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in May 2011. Yet this was straight from the Pele playbook. Stoke had not managed a single shot on target with half-time minutes away and there seemed no danger as Adam picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half. Courtois mistakenly thought the same. Yet this is nothing new from Adam. He did it for Blackpool reserves previously, and Ross County, too. Asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game, Adam said: \u2018Every time.\u2019 Midway through this interview, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba interrupts. \u2018Why?\u2019 he asks Adam in mock indignation. \u2018Tell me why?\u2019 To which Adam replies: \u2018I watch your videos.\u2019 Indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on YouTube and, on Saturday, Adam rightly earned his place in history among them.",

Sexual assault charges against a Chicago Uber driver have been dropped after prosecutors heard a secret recording he made of his passenger the night of the alleged attack. Maxine Fohounhedo, 30, was charged in December with kidnapping and raping a female passenger he picked up after she ordered an UberX ride the month before. The 22-year-old woman told police she was intoxicated \u00a0and fell in and out of consciousness during the ride with Fohounhedo. She alleged that she eventually woke up in Fohounhedo's apartment as he was having sex with her, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The woman told police he then helped her into his car and drove her home. She called police the next day and a rape kit was administered at Swedish Covenant Hospital, the\u00a0Chicago Tribune\u00a0reported. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, claims the woman made a pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place.' 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' Yassin said. According to Yassin, Fohounhedo made the nine-minute recording as he drove the woman home because 'he had a gut feeling he needed to protect himself'. 'She was having a friendly conversation with him,' Yassin said. 'And talking about her boyfriend and her work, and gave him a hug in the end.' Yassin said when Fohounhedo helped the woman out of his car she said 'thank you so much'. The attorney said prosecutors authenticated the recording after Fohounhedo turned over his phone. Shady Yassin, Fohounhedo's attorney, said the woman made the pass at his client when he first picked her up and then they 'went back to his place'. 'Whatever happened there did not arise to anything criminal,' he said. Fohounhedo's wife Sheena (right) said the couple will have to work to get past the incident . Fohounhedo was released from Cook County Jail on Monday night. He has spent the last four months behind bars. Sheena Fohounhedo, his wife, told\u00a0ABC 7\u00a0the couple will have to work to get past the incident but that she is happy her husband is coming home . Fohounhedo was using his wife's Uber account, which is a violation of the company's policy, when he picked up the 22-year-old woman. Uber removed Fohounhedo from the service after he was charged with assault. Yassin said his client wasn't given a chance and that 'everybody immediately thought he was guilty'. He said Fohounhedo has no ill will against Uber but does not plan to work with the company again. Fohounhedo was just one of several Uber drivers who have been accused of sexual assault since the app was launched in the US in 2011. Another woman in Chicago sued the company earlier this year after her driver allegedly locked her in the car and groped her breast, legs and groin before she escaped.",

Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, was arrested Wednesday night at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after returning on a flight from Turkey. He has now been charged in a criminal complaint with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, Wisconsin (pictured left in his mugshot on Wednesday and right in 2010 when he\u00a0registed on the sex offender's list) has been accused of flying to ISIS in a failed attempt to join ISIS . The criminal complaint, which had been under seal since Oct. 28, alleges that Van Haften talked to people about his plan before leaving the United States in August for Istanbul. The complaint cites Facebook posts from Van Haften that said he was unable to cross the border from Turkey into Syria. In one post, Van Haften complained that the people who were supposed to help him just wanted his money, that he had almost no cash left and that he was dropped off on a road in the country and never picked up. Wisconsin court records showed several previous convictions for Van Haften, including felony battery in 1998, second degree felony sexual assault in 1999 and disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in 2007, online court records show. He was apprehended at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday after getting off a return flight from Syria (file picture) All of the offenses occurred in Rock County. Van Haften was sentenced to three years' probation on the battery conviction in 1998, but his probation was revoked in 1999 and he was sentenced to a year in jail. He was sentenced to eight years' probation on the sexual assault charge in 1999, but that was revoked in 2000. He was then sentenced to seven years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Carlin from the Department of Justice said stopping people from traveling to the region to join the Islamic State is a 'top priority'. She said in a statement: 'Stemming the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and holding accountable those who attempt to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations remains a top priority for the National Security Division.

The men were part of a group of five divers from the East Coast and San Francisco. Ten friends, including the dead men, had rented a house on Caspar Cove 160 miles north of San Francisco to hunt for abalone, a rare and expensive mollusk that is prized as a delicacy. The Santa Rosa Press Democrat\u00a0reports that the accident in Mendocino County is the deadliest single incident involving abalone divers in recent memory. Witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough, choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby. Abalone is a prized delicacy that sells for up to $70 per pound. The annual abalone season brings divers out into the rough waters of northern California (stock image) The three men died after diving into rough waters off of rocky coastline in Mendocino County, California, on Sunday in search of abalone (stock imagine of abalone diver) Firefighters said the men dove into water in Caspar Cove and found themselves immediately in trouble. An off-duty firefighter who happened to be fishing nearby spotted the men and called for help. The three men who drowned were overcome by the churning water and crushed against the sharp rocks on shore. Rescuers managed to pull the two survivors and one of the dead men from the water immediately after arriving on scene. A Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office helicopter plucked the second victim from the sea and brought him to shore. Ten friends from the East Coast and San Francisco rented a house on Caspar Cove to dive for abalone, locals said. Five of them went out on Sunday - three died . Firefighters performed CPR on the two drowned men on the beach as his horrified friends watched - but both were pronounced dead on Sunday afternoon. The third man's body was found after a five-hour search that involved aircraft and boats from several fire departments and sheriff's offices, as well as the US Coast Guard. He was smashed against rocks in a cove, which required rescuers to hoist his body up the cliff with a winch because they couldn't get to him by water. Local authorities say the abalone season, which started April 1, is always marred by several rescues and often a few death.

Larry Kramer, 79, says he believes what's written in his history book is true though he is selling it as fiction to avoid legal troubles. In Volume One of his two part book 'The American People,' Kramer says that Abraham Lincoln was gay and his killer John Wilkes Booth was actually Lincoln's spurned gay lover. 'We know that Abraham Lincoln was gay,' Kramer told CBS in an interview about the book which came out this month. Were they gay?: Writer and gay activist Larry Kramer claims that Abraham Lincoln (left) and George Washington (right) were gay . The American People: Volume one of the two part book by Larry Kramer explores prehistoric America's unwritten gay history up to the present day . Abraham Lincoln . According to Larry Kramer, Abraham Lincoln slept with several men including\u00a0actor John Wilkes Booth\u00a0who later fatally shot him in a theater on April 14, 1965. Kramer claims that the motive for murder was not Booth's anger over the Civil War but was his unrequited love for the former president. Another indicator that Lincoln was gay is that he would share beds with other men, especially when his wife Mary left town. One such man was\u00a0Captain\u00a0David Derickson who would visit Lincoln at a retreat from\u00a0the White House called the Soldier's Home. Lincoln has been quoted as saying of Derickson, 'The captain and I are getting quite thick.' George Washington . Larry Kramer says that historians just don't have 'gaydar' when it comes to studying historic figures and that George was was 'basically a big queen.' Larry Kramer said in an interview with Sirius that George\u00a0Washington\u00a0loved decorating battle gear and that he was a bit of a dandy in his love of showmanship. 'In the case of Washington, he was a big queen, basically,' Kramer said. 'He decorated everything. He designed all the uniforms, the buttons. The correspondence exists with all the dealers he dealt with in England to make everything. And then there was a man called Baron Von Steuben, who was German, who designed all the maneuvers for all the troops of all the great armies in Europe. And he kept getting thrown out after he made the armies real \u2013 like Rockettes . He got kicked out and he came to George. And he and George hit it off like nobody\u2019s business.' Alexander Hamilton . According to Kramer, Alexander Hamilton was in love with George Washington claims the pair had an erotic father and son attraction. Alexander Hamilton was also supposedly involved with a young officer named John Laurens to whom he wrote 'love letters. ' 'You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent. But as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have artfully instilled into me,' said one of those letters to Laurens. In another letter to Laurens, Hamilton calls himself, 'a jealous lover.' Men of Jamestown . Even though sodomy was considered taboo at the time, Larry Kramer says that a lack of women in Jamestown led many men to experiment with one another in their absence. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Larry Kramer of the initially all male settlement. 'Why is that not in the history books? Because all history books are written by straight people, and they don't wanna either admit that, or they wouldn't know how to recognize what we call 'gaydar.' According to Kramer, Jamestown was a mecca of gay sex where men chose to sleep with men because there weren't any women around. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Kramer. Kramer says it took him 40 years to write his 800 page history book that spans from pre-historic america all the way to the 1950s. 'It's called a 'novel,' but that's just to keep the lawyers away from me,' Kramer said. 'I believe everything in the book is true. Everything in there happened,' said Kramer who has long wanted to write a book on gay history. Spurned lover: Larry Kramer claims John Wilkes Booth, who murdered Abraham Lincoln, was one of Lincoln's spurned male lovers . The writer: Larry Kramer, 79, is an HIV positive American writer and gay rights advocate who spent 40 years writing his most recent book . 'It may look like fiction, but to me, it\u2019s not,' Kramer told the New York Times. 'Most histories have been written by straight people. There has never been any history book written where the gay people have been in the history from the beginning.It\u2019s ridiculous to think we haven\u2019t been here for ever.' Kramer says that John Wilkes Booth's murder had nothing to do about the outcome of the Civil war, rather Bookes felt spurned by the president. Kramer's book doesn't only touch on the gay history of politicians but it also talks about the about the HIV crisis in the nation which will be the book's second volume. Kramer, who is HIV positive, said that 35 years is too long for a plague like HIV to still be in existence. 'You'll hear all about the plague of AIDS in the second volume, and a lot about Ronald Reagan,' Kramer said. 'It's not a nice story, but it's one that needs to be told. If I've been kept alive for any reason, it was to tell this story.'",

Joshua will be entering the ring for the first time in 2015, after he was forced to pull out of a January fight against Kevin Johnson due to a stress fracture in his back. The London 2012 gold medallist is unbeaten in 10 professional bouts but yet to go past round three, while Gavern is walking into the ring for the 50th time in his career. Anthony Joshua poses at his weigh-in ahead of the fight with Jason Gavern at the Newcastle Metro Arena . 'At 11 fights he's probably looking at me like I'm a raw novice in the professional world,' Joshua told IFL TV. 'He's got 50 fights and he's looking at himself like he has so much experience but hunger and determination has got me through a lot of the time. 'I'm 10 fights in now - double figures. I can definitely say I'm learning and everything will be second nature on Saturday. 'I'll try not to let the nerves get to me. I'm going to stay calm. It's a mental thing. 'Sparring has been really good. I've been sparring with guys who are sharp and I've been handling business in sparring so I should be good to go on Saturday night.' Gavern's last fight in the UK came in November 2013, when he lost the Prizefighter final to Michael Sprott - an opponent Joshua took just 90 seconds to knock out in November. The British heavyweight is, however, taking nothing for granted this weekend. 'There's no sparring you can do to prepare for Gavern,' Joshua said. 'With 50 fights and so much experience, he's a very awkward opponent. 'I've watched his videos and he's awkward to hit. 'He's entertaining as well - he can get in your head mentally. 'I've been out five months so I'll probably have a bit of ring rust myself while he'll be sharp so there will be some heavyweight blows and may the best man win.'

'Boxing is about opportunities and I'm looking forward to this fight,' Gavern said. 'I saw the odds on Facebook of me getting knocked out within 15 seconds, or 20 seconds or 30 seconds - it's kind of funny. 'It's the heavyweight division, Anthony Joshua is here for a reason.

Irwin Horwitz, an instructional associate professor in the university's department of maritime administration, told CNN affiliate KPRC that he had finally reached a breaking point. \"Enough was enough,\" Horwitz said. \"It became apparent that they couldn't do just some of the most simple and basic things that they should've been able to do at that point.\" In the email to students, KPRC reported, Horwitz said: \"I have seen cheating, been told by students to 'chill out,' 'get out of my space,' 'go back and teach' refuse to leave the room after being told to do so following inappropriate conduct, called a 'f*****g moron' several times by a student to my face...\" Horwitz added that students spread hurtful rumors about him, his wife and colleagues, and that he felt the need for police protection in class. John Shaw, a senior at Texas A&M Galveston and student in Horwitz's class, told KPRC he was worried about the job he has lined up after graduation. \"Just ridiculous, because, I mean, I had never had a problem in the class,\" Shaw said. \"I thought I had done pretty well, done pretty well on the first test and everything else that's going on. I get an email saying I am going to get an F in the class, and just kind of -- it was overwhelming.\" Texas A&M Galveston is a part of the Texas A&M University System; its more than 2,000 students focus on marine and maritime studies. Patrick Louchouarn, the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer, told KPRC that the university will not necessarily stand by the failing grades Horwitz planned to hand out. University officials said the department head will take over teaching the strategic management class. \"None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail is because he or she hasn't performed the actual, you know, with the expectations for that particular class,\" Louchouarn said. University officials have not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.",

The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering the race as a 'leftist' alternative to Clinton in the hopes that this will see him represent the party in the 2016 elections. This claims come in the wake of a television appearance last week, just hours before Clinton announced her candidacy, where de Blasio refused to back her. Scroll down for video . The Mayor of New York is allegedly entering preparing to run for president as a 'leftist' alternative to Hillary Clinton, according to a source within the Democratic Party . De Blasio's intentions to throw his hat in the ring as Democrat presidential candidate comes from a 'national party operative', according to the New York Post. The mayor's bid for presidency is backed by the Working Families Party, and he hopes that left-leaning 'progressive activists' will join them in supporting him over the coming months, the source claims. 'De Blasio and his advisers are trying to position the mayor as the 'draft' candidate for the left in 2016. That's why he refused to endorse Hillary last week,' the party operative told the Post. The 53-year-old has yet to back Clinton, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000, an indication that the rumours of his intentions to run for president may be true. The New York City mayor, known to be more liberal than Clinton on most issues, surprised many Democrats when he declined to endorse his former boss during an interview last week. Behind her back? Bill de Blasio has yet to endorse Hillary Clinton as the Democrats' presidential candidate, despite the fact that he was campaign manager of her U.S. Senate bid in 2000 . The New York City mayor, seen inspecting a Bronx apartment as pary of an affordable housing project, said he will not endorse Clinton  until he can 'see an actual vision of where they want to go' Appearing on Meet The Press, De Blasio said he would withhold his blessing 'until I see an actual vision of where they want to go.' 'She's a tremendous public servant,' the mayor continued. 'I think she is one of the most qualified people to ever run for this office. And by the way, thoroughly vetted, we can say that. But we need to see the substance.' De Blasio has taken several steps to raise his profile in recent weeks, including making a bid for the 2016 Democratic National Convention, hosting a meeting of liberals at Gracie Mansion this month and traveling to Nebraska and Iowa \u2014 site of the first nominating caucus \u2014 \u00a0last  week to champion the fight against income inequality. Today, Clinton is scheduled to arrive in New Hampshire as she steps up her campaign for the Democratic nomination. As she did in Iowa last week, Clinton plans to forgo the packed rallies that marked her previous campaign and focus on smaller round-table events with selected groups of supporters.",

But in his life, 50-year-old Walter Scott was also the father of four children and served in the Coast Guard before being honorably discharged. \"He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody,\" his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon. \"All the family loves him, and his kids loved him.\" Until it all came crashing down Saturday morning, when North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run. Why did he run? Justin Bamberg, a lawyer for Scott's family, speculated Thursday it could have been related to \"child support and a fear of maybe going back to (jail).\" At the time of his death, Scott owed over $18,000 in back payments for two children and hadn't made a payment since July 2012, according to Charleston County family court documents. Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years. \"I know that it had nothing to do with anything violent,\" Bamberg said of Scott's legal history. \"He was not a dangerous person.\" According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun. Slager fired eight shots, five of which struck Scott. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, \"running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty,\" Stewart said. Slager has been charged with murder, a charge that might not have come about if not for a bystander's video of the shooting. Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family. \"When I saw that video for the first time, my family was deeply hurt that someone would gun down a human being in that way,\" the brother said. \"We just couldn't believe it.\" The last time the family got together with Walter Scott was when the siblings threw a surprise wedding anniversary party for their parents. \"It was a great celebration,\" Anthony Scott said. \"My dad and brothers planned it, and (my mother) was totally surprised. \"Now this happens,\" Scott said, referring to his brother's shooting. \"It's so tragic.\" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

Jamie Anderson said the CGI characters did not have the same charm as the 'lovingly detailed' miniature puppets. Thunderbirds will return to our screens tonight 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects \u2013 real explosions rather than computer-generated ones. 'There is something utterly magical about seeing a puppet come to life under the skilled operation of talented puppeteers. 'Sadly for fans old and new alike, that's not going to be possible with the new series.' Iconic: Gerry Anderson with a model of Thunderbird 1 - his son Jamie has criticised the new CGI characters . Quest: As with the original show, the remake will feature the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world . Thunderbirds aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065. When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet\u00a0their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There is also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget . The iconic children's classic\u00a0aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002 . Jamie Anderson, son of Gerry, said there was something 'utterly magical' about seeing a puppet come to life . The updated version of the iconic show is not the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was a dismal flop, losing almost \u00a320 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show's co-creator, called it 'the biggest load of c**p' he had seen. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a modest budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Peter Jackson's animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics. Rosamund Pike, the Gone Girl star, will voice Lady Penelope in the new show and 89-year-old David Graham has returned to voice her driver, Parker. He has dropped his chauffeur uniform and now sports a roll-neck sweater. He also has a clipped Indian accent. The new version kicks off on today at 5pm on ITV with a double episode, before moving to an 8am slot on the same day.",

There are those who believe that mankind's activities are changing the planet's climate, and those who don't. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion Tuesday at Howard University's College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. \"I think we've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,\" the President told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn't go running outside,\" Obama said. \"You'd have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air's a lot better.\" \"There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,\" Obama continued. \"Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or climate.\" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. \"It's also personal to me because I've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,\" Murthy said.  \"Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse.\" \"This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,\" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. \"The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,\" Obama told Gupta. \"What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we're releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis.\" \"Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,\" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \"These factors include the effectiveness of a community's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,\" the EPA says on its website. \"Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society's ability to adapt to change.\" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. \"Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition.\" \"Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,\" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's public health and environment department. \"We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health.\" \"Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world's poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?\" \"Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,\" writes Neira. \"Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider.\" Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years, according to the EPA. \"Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather,\" the agency warns. \"Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves.\" Still, there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening. \"Although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather, Americans are no more likely today (55%) than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring,\" according to a March Gallup poll. A 2013 TIME magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming. \"Framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people, since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people's lives,\" the article says. \"This strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided, if action is taken early enough.\" The President said what happened with Los Angeles' air proved that point. \"When the Clean Air Act was passed, not only was there a terrible smog in Los Angeles, it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country,\" Obama said. \"The fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it's been much cheaper than anybody expected, because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it. As a consequence, the American people are a lot healthier, in addition to being able to, you know, see the mountains in the background because it's not covered in smog.\" \"We know how to do this,\" Obama said. \"We just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the American people have always displayed.\"",

The reigning box office champion might have slowed from its blockbuster debut, but Furious 7 maintained first place for the third weekend in a row with an estimated $29.1 million, according to box office tracker Rentrak on Sunday. This brings the fast car sequel's domestic total to a staggering $294 million, well above the $202.8 million that Fast & Furious 6 had earned at the same point in the cycle in 2013. Scroll down for video . The fast car sequel, starring Vin Diesel, has raced to number seven on the list of highest grossing movies in just three weeks and is predicted to overtake the likes of Frozen and Iron Man 3 in a matter of weeks . Crashing hit: The blockbuster, also co-starring Vin Diesel and Jason Statham, has already earned $1 billion . On Friday, Furious 7 joined the $1 billion club at the worldwide box office, leaping into the top twenty grossing films of all time worldwide. Over the weekend, Furious 7 added even more to its international total, jumping even higher on the all-time worldwide charts. Furious 7 is now one of the ten highest grossing movies of all-time worldwide, ranking seventh with $1.152 billion. With Furious 7 still going strong, the question becomes now how high can it climb? The film will almost certainly race past Iron Man 3 and Frozen to join the top five all-time at the worldwide box office before the month is out. 'The film has set a new standard for the potential for box-office in the pre-summer month of April and has truly become part of movie folklore with its record setting numbers, strong reviews, spectacular word-of-mouth and of course the outpouring of support for late star Paul Walker,' Rentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. Poll position: Furious 7, starring the late Paul Walker, right, won the box office crown for the third week running, taking an estimated $29.1 million over the weekend . Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 came in a close second with an estimated $24 million. While the PG-rated comedy didn't perform as well as the first film's $31.8 million opening in 2009, it did surpass Sony's modest expectations. Also, it only cost $30 million to produce. 'It's a great result. It's going to be very profitable for us and a big success,' Sony's President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Bruer said. 'It was something that Kevin really wanted to do and we wanted to do it with him,' he said. 'Kudos to Kevin for working so hard in promoting the film.' Dergarabedian said 'Blart's' opening 'proves that if you give the people what they want, you can make a tidy profit.' Meanwhile, the low-budget, social media themed thriller Unfriended took third place with $16 million \u2014 sixteen times its production budget.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nWashington (CNN)Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight. Roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold Obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry. The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century, and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race. Appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage, but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation's highest court, led by Roberts. Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. He dissented in United States v. Windsor, a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. And he's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans. Yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice, and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally. They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again. \"If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality, the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court,\" said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which is advocating for same-sex marriage. \"Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision?\" For some conservatives, a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment. It would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when Justice David Souter, who was nominated to the bench by George H.W. Bush and who retired in 2009, consistently voted with the liberals or when Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan appointee, disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty. Or when Roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold Obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government's taxing authority. The hope in conservative circles is that Roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people, not the courts. \"The chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the Constitution,\" said Edward Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \"Blatherings about the 'wrong side of history' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice.\" Those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the Windsor case. In his majority opinion, Kennedy said the \"principal purpose\" of the Defense of Marriage Act was to \"impose inequality.\" Roberts disagreed. He wrote separately to say he thought Congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide \"uniformity and stability\" at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman. Roberts picked up on Kennedy's language that emphasized the states' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday \"come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions.\" David Cruz of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law said that Roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the Obergefell case. \"Roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage,\" Cruz said. Indeed, the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in Michigan, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky in the Obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage. Another clue to Roberts' thinking in the Windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the Defense of Marriage Act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as President Bill Clinton, who signed it into law. \"I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry,\" Roberts wrote. The comments suggest he would reject an argument in the Obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people. But backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own. Schaeffer points out that Roberts didn't join the parts of the dissents penned by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage don't violate the Constitution. \"Roberts didn't join them in expressing those views,\" Schaeffer said. At the time, Roberts simply wrote that the court \"does not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does not decide\" whether states can ban same-sex marriage. Schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that wasn't before the court. \"But I think one reasonable explanation is that Roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality,\" she said. The Defense of Marriage Act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- Hollingsworth v. Perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage. The case concerned a challenge to California's Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage. But Roberts, writing for the majority, dismissed the case, holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court. The ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated Proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in California. Roberts' lesbian cousin, who lives in California, sat in the courtroom during arguments in the Prop 8 case. Few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the Supreme Court, but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing Windsor -- struck down the state bans. On the first day of the term last fall, the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue. Conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases. But conventional wisdom was completely wrong. Without comment, the court declined to take up any of the cases, clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages. The court's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known. But some speculate on one possible scenario: Roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in Windsor. Then again, even if the speculation were true, it doesn't reveal much about Roberts' thinking. There's a big difference between voting not to take up a case, which expresses no opinions on the merits, and issuing an opinion on the merits. And even when Roberts' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in California -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide, his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking. \"When the institution of marriage developed historically, people didn't get around and say, 'Let's have this institution, but let's keep out homosexuals,' \" Roberts said during the Proposition 8 oral arguments. \"The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples.\"",

Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in\u00a0Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The \u00a0name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is \u2018likely\u2019 to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by\u00a0Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged. This famous photograph, produced in 1934, was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, on his deathbed . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . Another renowned sighting was made in 2001 by semi-retired photographer James Gray and his friend Peter Levings when they were out fishing on the Loch . This blurred picture, said to show the Loch Ness Monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express .",

Martyn Uzzell, 51, died instantly after he was thrown into path of a car by a four-inch deep pothole. Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole . Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died . Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was \u2018no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident\u2019. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had \u2018existed for some time prior to the accident\u2019. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened. 'My husband was an experienced cyclist and was out doing what he loved, while raising money for charities close to his heart, but it has cost him his life. The council inspected the pothole in the weeks before Mr Uzzell's (pictured) death but decided it did not need repairing . 'I am told a policeman had reported the pothole on two occasions to the council but nothing was done. The road was also inspected monthly as it is an A-road, but despite the danger being recorded in May it wasn't repaired. 'To make it worse there was another inspection in June carried out in a vehicle going at 25mph down the other side of the three lane carriageway. 'No attempt was made to check an already identified defect, how can this be acceptable? 'Ultimately my husband lost his life because the council did not repair this pothole, despite being warned it was a potential danger, and I would like to know why something wasn't done. 'I do not want anyone else to lose a loved one because the roads have not been properly maintained,' she added. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded the failings by the council should not lead to a corporate manslaughter case or any other charges. Mrs Uzzell said the decision had left her devastated: 'My husband has died yet it seems no one is being held to account as to how this was allowed to happen. 'I have lost my best friend and soul mate, a lovely person, who bought joy to my life, I am now lost and lonely without Martyn. 'And it isn't just me. Martyn's entire family is also suffering the loss of someone very special.' A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire County Council said: 'Whilst North Yorkshire County Council accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell, the authority has appreciated that this is a sensitive matter and has therefore reached a settlement with Mr Uzzell\u2019s widow, to avoid prolonged involvement in further litigation. 'The county council operates a highways maintenance programme that includes a robust system of inspection. 'We continue to maintain and review that inspection regime to ensure the safety of routes for the travelling public.\u2019",

The Ukip leader said anti-English sentiment in Scotland was now the 'biggest' form of racism in the UK. H\u200ee said Mr Salmond had made the problem worse and said it was wrong that Ukip is called racist. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, pictured today giving a speech in Harrogate, said the SNP was 'openly racist', accusing Alex Salmond (right) of fuelling resentment . Speaking during a visit to Hartlepool, Mr Farage said: ''The biggest racism I have seen in British politics is happening north of the border where some of the anti-english hatred is reaching a truly astonishing level. 'T\u200ehe SNP are openly racist. The anti-English hostility and the kind of language that is used about and towards English people is totally extraordinary. 'If my supporters behaved in the way that some of those pro-independence supporters behaved in the referendum I'd have been painted out to be the worst person that had been seen for 70 years in British politics.' Asked if being anti-English was the same as being racist, Mr Farage said: 'When I say that I don't think we should have an open door to Poland, Latvia and Lithuania I'm accused of being racist and yet when it's the Scots being rude about the English you don't think it is. 'The fact is Ukip is a non-racist non-sectarian political party and we've got more members of black and ethnic minority standing for us than the Green Party or the Liberal Democrats. We're an all embracing party.' Mr Farage addressed supporters at the Grand Hotel, in Hartlepool, \u00a0as he stepped up his election push in the north of England . Nigel Farage has said he is 'astonished' by how little clothing women in Newcastle wear on a night out. The Ukip leader said it showed that people in the North East are 'particularly tough'. During a visit to Hartlepool, he said: 'The last time I went out in Newcastle was about 18 months ago and I think it was February or March and I think it was completely astonished to see how little clothing people wear in this part of the world. 'There were girls with platform shoes like that, dresses here, blokes in T-shirts and I can only conclude that although we are all from the same country you are particularly tough up here.' Mr Farage accused the former Scottish first minister of not doing enough to counter the problem. He said: 'I think the one I blame is Alex Salmond. When I was attacked by a group of thugs in the street in Edinburgh with the most extraordinary anti-English sentiments being shouted, when Salmond was asked whether he condemned that \u200ebehaviour he didn't. 'I think it is ironic that all the talk about extremism within British politics is pointed towards Ukip when there are others who are far more guilty.' Asked if Nicola Sturgeon was also to blame, Mr Farage added: 'She hasn't done anything to stop it, but I haven't heard her say anything to encourage it.\u200e' But SNP MSP Humza Yousaf hit back at the Ukip leader's 'politics of fear and intolerance'. He said: 'These disgraceful comments - which aren't just offensive to the SNP, but to the majority of people in Scotland on current polls - show exactly why the people of Scotland reject Ukip. 'Nigel Farage's politics of fear and intolerance have been exposed in this campaign, and he has still not apologised for David Coburn MEP comparing me to a convicted terrorist merely because I am a Muslim. 'The SNP have been clear that we will be a positive voice for people across the UK - and with progressive policies such as ending austerity to invest in public services and our NHS, we can bring real change north and south of the border. 'All Ukip have to offer is nasty rhetoric.' Mr Farage said both Nicola Sturgeon and Mr Salmond had failed to act to quell resentment between the English and Scots . Mr Farage also dismissed a claim from Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna that Ukip is infected with the 'virus of racism'. He said Mr Umunna, who he labelled 'the high priest of the liberal metropolitan elite', had made the comment because Labour is 'running scared' of Ukip. Hartlepool, which has been held by Labour since it was formed in 1974, is Ukip's main target seat in the North East at the general election . In 2010, Ukip took just seven per cent of the vote and Labour's Iain Wright retained the seat with a 5,509 majority. He replaced Peter Mandelson as the MP in a by-election in 2004 after the Labour grandee stood down to become a European Commissioner. Mr Farage's hopes for electoral victory in Hartlepool come after the town elected a man dressed as a monkey as its mayor in 2002. Stuart Drummond stood as 'H'Angus the Monkey', Hartlepool United FC's mascot, as a publicity stunt with the slogan, 'free bananas for schoolchildren'. He was re-elected in 2005 and 2009 before voters in the town backed a referendum to scrap the paid post in 2012. Hartlepool's residents are famously said to have hanged a monkey during the Napoleonic wars because they thought it was a French spy.",

United\u2019s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions\u2019 Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal\u2019s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs\u00a0Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs\u00a0San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs\u00a0Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs\u00a0Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer\u2019s tournament around United\u2019s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer\u2019s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer\u2019s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven\u2019t visited since David Moyes\u2019 pre-season of 2013.

Countering President Barack Obama's previous assertion,\u00a0Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'. The 62-year-old politician continued: 'We just set in place a process to ensure that if there's a deal, it's a deal that will stand the test of time, that will keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.' Making an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Corker  said that\u00a0Congressional scrutiny and approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran is essential to help make sure that the deal is not a bad one. Scroll down for video . Chairman: Senator Bob Corker (pictured), of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has denied partisan politics in Washington DC could derail America's landmark agreement to curb Iran's nuclear capabilities . He said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it, before finally voting on it. 'It's very important that Congress is in the middle of this, understanding, teasing out, asking those important questions,' Corker said. Negotiators announced a framework deal on Thursday. The deal is scheduled to be finalized by June 30. Meanwhile, the Committee is due to meet April 14 to consider Corker's legislation to ensure that Congress debates and signs off on any pact. The bill requires the president to transmit, within five days of reaching a final deal, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation. With key elements still to be finalized, the framework agreement sealed by U.S.-led world powers describes a program for stunting Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons, while giving Tehran quick access to assets and markets now blocked by international sanctions. In defending the framework and a potential final pact, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities. Argument: Countering President Barack Obama's (pictured) previous assertion, Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Fox News Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal' These will allow the U.S. and its partner negotiators to know almost instantly should Iran try to evade the oversight, Moniz said during an appearance on CBS' 'Face The Nation. This is a long-term arrangement, he stressed, with requirements lasting a quarter century or more. 'We'll have eyes on the entire supply chain of uranium,' he added on the program. 'Going back to mines, the mills, we'll have continuous surveillance of centrifuge production.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has criticized the framework as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. He is urging negotiators to improve the agreement or scuttle it. Other Republicans have echoed Netanyahu's concerns. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Sunday the proposed deal is a bad one - but was the best one Obama could get because the Iranians don't fear or respect him. Response: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has criticized the framework deal as deeply flawed and a threat to Israel's very existence. But in defending the framework, US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (right) cited what he called 'unprecedented access and transparency' into Iran's nuclear activities . He said that he favors waiting until a new president, Democratic or Republican, takes office in January 2017 and then trying again. In the meantime, economic and financial sanctions would stay in place. 'Is there a better deal to be had? I think so,' Graham said on CBS' 'Face The Nation.' But a senior Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, warned that bashing the proposed deal could backfire on Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister and other critics of the framework agreement have offered no viable alternatives, she said on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Feinstein said imposing more and stiffer economic sanctions would only drive Iran's nuclear program deeper underground and make it more difficult to monitor.\u00a0'I wish he would contain himself,' Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said of Netanyahu. Officials (L-r) European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat, and an unidentified Russian official, look on as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond shakes hands with Secretary of State John Kerry in Switzerland . The preliminary deal,  announced in Switzerland on Thursday, sees Iran agree to not build any new centrifuges for 15 years, and not enrich uranium at the previously secret Fordow site for 15 years. The country also agrees to reduce nuclear-material centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, let the IAEA store all the extra centrifuges, give IAEA inspectors access to its uranium mills for 25 years and rebuild heavy-water reactor at Arak so it can't produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it would not build any new heavy-water reactors for 15 years. In return, the West will give Iran relief from nuclear-related economic sanctions 'if it verifiably abides by its commitments', and lift 'all past UN Security Council resolutions on the Iran nuclear issue' as soon as Iran has completed all its promised 'nuclear-related actions'. America's sanctions on Iran relating to 'terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles' will remain in place.",

It is a painful and embarrassing condition that affects millions of British women. Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth. Complications include an uncomfortable dragging or \u2018full\u2019 feeling, discomfort during sex or stress incontinence. Although up to half of women are thought to suffer to some degree, far fewer seek help, and many who do are offered just one solution: a hysterectomy. While surgical removal of the reproductive organs solves the immediate problem, it also ends fertility, and with three months of recovery needed, it is no quick fix. Now, a leading gynaecologist has claimed thousands of patients may be undergoing the drastic operation needlessly. He is one of a growing number of surgeons who claim not enough women are offered the alternative: a half-hour keyhole procedure that uses an implanted mesh \u2018sling\u2019 made from nylon to lift and hold the womb back in place, providing a permanent solution to a prolapse and preserving fertility. The procedure, called a sacrohysteropexy, is rare, with just 1,072 admissions for the surgery in the past three years. By contrast, there were 145,310 admissions to hospitals in England in the past three years for hysterectomies due to conditions such as fibroids, pelvic pain or cancer, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Surgeon Jonathan Broome, who has performed more than 1,000 sacrohysteropexies in the past 15 years, has called for the option to be made more widely available on the NHS so women of child-bearing age are not forced to choose between quality of life or the chance to have children. \u2018Most women requiring surgery for a prolapse will be referred for a hysterectomy by their GP,\u2019 says Mr Broome, who performs the \u00a34,000 procedure for both NHS and private patients at hospitals in Lancashire and Greater Manchester. \u2018That means some women are faced with the dilemma of living a normal life without a prolapse, or the possibility of having children. 'Far too many GPs recommend hysterectomies as the solution to a prolapse, when a sacrohysteropexy is a much better alternative. It\u2019s a shorter operation, with shorter recovery time because it is less invasive, and fertility is not put at risk.\u2019 Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth (file image) Common causes of prolapse include childbirth, lower levels of oestrogen at menopause, being overweight and chronic illnesses such as lung diseases, which create pressure inside the abdomen from coughing. Half of women over 50 will have symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and more than one in ten will have had surgery for the problem by the age of 80. Concerns have been raised about the use of mesh implants in gynaecological procedures, with some women in Scotland and the US complaining of problems including bleeding and infections. But consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones says the risk of complications where mesh is inserted abdominally is very small. Medical watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has received two reports of adverse incidents relating to a sacrohysteropexy since 2011. \u25cfA sacrohysteropexy is keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic to put the womb back into its normal position. \u25cfTiny cuts are made in the stomach through which a telescope and instruments are passed. \u25cfA piece of mesh is inserted via an incision along the bikini line. Using tiny needles, one end of the mesh is attached to the back of the cervix and the other to the coccyx, and it is fixed with metal staples. The mesh is also covered with a thin layer of tissue to prevent scar tissue forming, encouraging the tissue to grow and make the repair stronger. \u25cfIt can stay in place indefinitely and does not require a repeat operation. \u25cfThe procedure takes half an hour and involves an overnight stay in hospital. Mr Spence-Jones agrees that too many women are given the wrong advice on what surgery is right for them. \u2018There seems to be a notion in general practice that taking everything \u2013 in other words, a hysterectomy \u2013 is the answer to a prolapse, when that isn\u2019t the case,\u2019 he says. \u2018Sparing the fertility is a reason for considering procedures other than a hysterectomy, but not the only one.\u2019 One woman who says her life has been transformed by a sacrohysteropexy is 44-year-old mother- of-two Karen Bane, from Lancashire. She suffered feelings of bloatedness following the birth of her daughters Gabrielle, seven, and Jessica, five. \u2018I felt sluggish \u2013 I had back pain, sitting was uncomfortable and intercourse was painful. I\u2019d also started to have leakage. It was mortifying being a woman in my early 40s and not being able to control my bladder. \u2018I put up with the symptoms for five years, but when I started to have bleeding, I knew enough was enough. I was a mother of two young children, yet all I could see were years of misery in front of me.\u2019 Karen went to her GP with her symptoms in May 2014 and was referred to Mr Broome.

Can you smell when it's going to rain? Professor Barry Smith, founder of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says: \u2018Yes you can. Air pressure falls and humidity increases when it is about to rain, and our noses act like a barometer, picking up these subtle changes in the air. \u2018Humidity makes smells more intense. The smell gets stronger still when rain starts to fall, as droplets of water will pick up molecules from the surface they hit \u2013 such as grass or dirt \u2013 and carry them into the air.\u2019",

A survey of 1,001 British Muslims found that one in four of this cohort had some sympathy with those who decide to join terror organisations such as ISIS. The figures show that among young and female Muslims, one third have sympathy for the Jihadi runaways despite the deplorable images of ISIS atrocities posted on the internet. Eight per cent agreed they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame the security services for radicalising young Jihadis . Eight per cent of British Muslims said they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John, pictured . Six out of ten strongly condemned those, such as Jihadi John, who have joined ISIS. The survey\u00a0conducted by Survation on behalf of Sky News found that one-third of all Muslims felt they are viewed with suspicion by non-Muslims. It follows a similar poll earlier this year that found more than a quarter of Muslims sympathised with the Charlie Hebdo attackers, who brutally murdered journalists at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. Yesterday's Survation study of 1,001 non-Muslims, 44 per cent agreed they were more suspicious of Muslims than they had been previously. The pollsters asked Muslims and non-Muslims about whether they felt Islam was 'compatible' with British values and the British way of life. According to the survey, three quarters of Muslims agreed their religion was compatible with the values of British society, with 14 per cent disagreeing. For non-Muslims, less than one quarter viewed Islam as compatible with British values with around half saying the religion was incompatible. One in five followers of Islam believe that British Muslims do not do enough to integrate into society, while 64 per cent believe they do, the pollsters found. Another six per cent felt it was not important for Muslims to fit into British society. Their families: 44% . Government: 15.1% . Religious authorities: 8.8% . Police: 3% . Schools: 2.2% . No-one: 4.6% . Other: 22.1% . 1,001 Muslims polled by Survation for Sky News . The researchers found that one in seven non-Muslims had sympathy for those who have joined ISIS. The researchers found that almost 40 per cent of Muslims agreed that the security services were partly responsible for radicalising young Jihadis, compared with 16 per cent of non-Muslims. Meanwhile more than half of the Muslims surveyed said it was their responsibility to condemn terrorist attacks by Muslims in the name of Islam, while a third said it was not. When it comes to stopping young Muslims joining terrorist groups, 44 per cent felt it was the responsibility of their families to set them straight. More than 15 per cent said it was the government's responsibility, followed by religious authorities (nine per cent), the police (three per cent) and schools (two per cent). The father of one of the three east London schoolgirls who fled to Syria to become 'jihadi brides' blamed the police for failing to keep track of them. Abase Hussen (circled) blamed the police and schools for allowing his daughter to travel to Syria to join ISIS, only for footage to emerge of him at an extremist rally in central London . More than a quarter of Muslims polled in a previous survey said they had sympathy for the Charlie Hebdo attackers . Abase Hussen\u00a0gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls\u2019 actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe issued a grovelling apology to the family, only for footage to emerge showing Mr Hussen at an extremist rally in central London. He could be seen standing just feet from one of Lee Rigby's killers while yelling: 'Burn, burn USA.' The survey comes two months after a separate poll found that more than quarter of Muslims said they had sympathy for Charlie Hebdo attackers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who killed 12 on their rampage around Paris. That poll, commissioned by the BBC, also found that 32 per cent of Muslims were 'not surprised' that the massacre took place. And more than 10 per cent of the 1,000 British Muslims interviewed agreed that the magazine 'deserved' to be attacked. The Muslim Council of Britain told the\u00a0Daily Telegraph: 'For many, current counter-terrorism measures, particularly related to the Prevent strategy, actually lead to greater alienation as Muslims are seen through the lens of security, rather than tackling the scourge of terrorism itself.' The Council said it was pleased that the survey 'once again confirms that Muslims feel British and have a strong affinity with our shared universal values'.",

A former Celtic star tried to dodge performing unpaid work for shoplifting from Harrods - after claiming it would disrupt his search for a new club. Andre Blackman, 24, who now plays for doomed Championship side Blackpool FC, stole a jacket worth more than \u00a31,000 from the world famous store in Knightsbridge. Blackman, who has been told he is \u2018surplus to requirements\u2019 by Tangerines boss Lee Clark, described the offence as a \u2018moment of madness.\u2019 He was ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after Hammersmith Magistrates\u2019 Court was told he fled from the shop with the \u00a31,225 jacket. He was arrested shortly afterwards and the jacket was recovered. Blackman told Deputy District Judge Samantha Mace: \u2018It was just a moment of madness. It was not something that I intended to do, or something I do regularly. \u2018I\u2019m just absolutely speechless.\u2019 Blackman told the judge his attempts to find a new club might be hindered if he was forced to carry out community work. He said the travelling to different clubs would be the biggest problem. Explaining his situation, he said: \u2018I have got my current agent looking around on my behalf and there have been a few clubs that might be interested. \u2018And because we are closer to the end of the season they are just waiting to see whether they are going down or staying up.\u2019 \u2018Once I do work for a club I would have to come back to the court and say that something has come up.\u2019 Judge Mace told Blackman, who temporarily resides in a hotel in Blackpool using the \u00a3125 living allowance he receives from the club, that he would be more than capable of carrying out unpaid work before the new season begins. Blackman has already played for 11 clubs in his short career. Blackpool defender Blackman has played just three Championship games for the Tangerines this season . Blackman has been told by Blackpool boss Lee Clark that he is surplus to requirements at Bloomfield Road . He played for Arsenal\u2019s academy between 2001-06, and Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s between 2006-07. Blackman signed his first professional contract with Bristol City in 2009, making his debut in a League Cup match against Brentford in August 2009, before playing for AFC Wimbledon, Celtic, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Plymouth Argyle, Dover, Maidenhead, and most recently Blackpool. He was awarded \u2018Tackle of the Year\u2019 at Celtic when he accidentally collided with manager Neil Lennon during a match, sending him crashing into the turf . Judge Mace told Blackman his offending was at the \u2018lower end\u2019 of the spectrum, and that 40 hours of unpaid work could be completed before September. She added that if the order really hinders him from finding a new club then he can apply to the court to be sentenced in another way. Judge Mace said \u2018Because you haven\u2019t been signed by a club just yet, you should be able to complete the hours before the new season, and if you really really can\u2019t do it you can make an application to the court to deal with sentence in another way.\u2019 The judge ordering him to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order and to pay \u00a385 in costs. \u2018As I have said, because the goods were of a high value, the fact you do have a similar conviction - albeit a long time ago - and the fact that you did try to run away from the shop before being apprehended by the police, this makes it serious enough to merit a community order. \u2018In the present circumstances I do think it\u2019s appropriate for such an order to be made. \u2018It would be far more serious if you had not pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.\u2019 Blackman, of Edymion Road, Brixton, southwest London, must complete his community service by April next year.",

The massive fire started  last Wednesday and took more than 24 hours to put out. John O'Connor, a highly experienced former police detective, has claimed the major power outage and the proximity of the multi-million burglary was far more than a coincidence. Scroll down for video . A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . It came shortly after firefighters  battled a major fire in Holborn - just 500 metres from the raid site . Speaking on LBC, Mr O'Connor said: 'Yeah, I think that probably was deliberate. 'I've never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that. That seems to me as too much of a coincidence.' He also said that in his opinion, to succeed with such a complicated and ambitious crime, the gang must have had some inside help. He added: 'You're gonna have to have a detailed layout of the whole of the business. So clearly they got that from somebody on the inside.' He later told Sky News: 'You've got a major strong room, there's no sign of a forced entry, they've apparently been able to abseil down the lift shaft to get access to the vault - I just find it astonishing that it was that easy. 'The fact that there is no sign of forced entry, what does that mean? That someone left the door open? That someone left the windows open? Former head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, John O'Connor, pictured, said the Holborn fire and the raid could be linked . 'It smacks all the time of inside aid, all of the way through it. This doesn't look to me like a genuine sort of smash and grab raid by determined criminals, this looks like they've had accomplices on the inside.You wouldn't go to attack a building like that unless you knew you could gain access.' The London Fire Brigade said they do not believe that the blaze was caused deliberately. Fire experts said their initial assessment showed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the Victorian tunnels running below ground, damaging an eight inch gas main which ruptured and fuelled the flames. Fresh details of the daring heist emerged yesterday as police forensic teams continued to sift through the rubble in the vault. It is believed an alarm was triggered when the professional gang broke into the building in the heart of London\u2019s jewellery district. A security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the property on Good Friday before leaving when he found nothing untoward. Police have refused to say whether officers were despatched to investigate around the same time. The gang used a heavy-duty drill weighing 77lb to bore through a reinforced 7ft concrete wall to reach the vault. When the raid was discovered on Tuesday, police discovered cheaper jewels left strewn amid a large heap of rubble in the vault. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad said: \u2018I\u2019d say it\u2019s a sophisticated offence and clearly it would have taken some pre-planning. It\u2019s organised. It\u2019s people who have planned it and they know how they were going to go about it. \u2018I would imagine that the pool of people [who could carry out the heist] is quite limited.\u2019 The  fire started underground just several hundred yards from where the heist took place a few days later . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . It has also emerged that celebrities and Premier League footballers could be among the victims of the thieves. A source told the Daily Mail: \u2018At least two of the jewellers have gems in the vault which have been bought by footballers and celebrities. They are waiting nervously to find out if they are among the victims.\u2019 Mr Johnson described how the gang gained access to one of the offices on the second floor of the building where they disabled the lift before climbing down. Once in the basement the thieves forced open the lift doors to get close to the vault. They used a \u00a33,500 Hilti DD350 drill, which is commonly used on large construction sites, to drill through the reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault. Joel Vinsant, secretary of the Drilling and Sawing Association, said that even with high-tech equipment, it may have taken hours for the thieves to drill through the concrete. He said: \u2018What they might have done is to bore several holes with a rig-based drill until they had made a space big enough to get through, rather than boring one hole and breaking through. It could have taken up to an hour per hole.\u2019 Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Police yesterday revealed the thieves used a Hilti DD 350 drill to get through the two-metre thick vault walls . During the raid the gang used an angle grinder and crowbars to force their way into 70 deposit boxes to steal the gems and cash inside. They then made their escape before employees arriving for work on Tuesday spotted the raid. Mr Johnson added: \u2018The scene is chaotic. The vault is covered in dust and debris and the floor is strewn with discarded safety deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars. \u2018There is no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building. We are in the process of identifying the owners of the safety deposit boxes and contacting them to take statements and find out what has been stolen.\u2019 He said his team had only just reached the vault because of the amount of debris at the scene. Mr Johnson added: \u2018It\u2019s got to be a slow, painstaking and methodical forensic process to get in there.\u2019 Experts fear the thieves may have already smuggled the jewels out of the country and are planning to cut up the larger gems to make it easier to sell them on the black market. One jeweller who rents a deposit box said police have identified the owners of 30 boxes which had been broken into. Furious jewellery dealers today accused the manager of the safe deposit of 'gross negligence'. Pictured: Felix Stephens (left) and\u00a0Gerald Landon (right)",

The Southwest Airlines flight which was scheduled to leave  Midway International Airport at 1.15pm was delayed for almost two hours due to the 'disturbance'. The Chicago Fire Department was called to evaluate Mr Modarkski after he was stabbed in the arm. Mr Mordarski said he would not be pressing charges following the incident. His best friend, photographer Michael Sutton, said the pen stabbing began after Lenny's arm brushed up against the woman while he slept. Mr Sutton, 41, told Daily Mail Online: 'She took her pen and stabbed his arm several times causing him to yell out in pain. 'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment. 'Luckily he wore a thick long sleeve shirt or there would have been blood. He will have a few bruises in the morning. 'The passengers cheered when they heard she wasn't coming back on.' Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight.

David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.' Armstrong said there's been no attempt to meet with Howman since 2013.",

The latest report shows that he sped up the descent of the plane to its doom. It's terrifying. As the investigation unfolds, we will learn more about to what extent Lubitz kept his mental illness secret, or how much help he sought. How much did his battle with depression affect his fitness to fly? Should he have walked away from his job? Should his doctors have sounded alarm bells? His case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma. Too often and for too long, people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen. When we don't distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one, we reinforce a pernicious idea that's both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness. Some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help. That's why in our public and more private discourse, people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that doesn't drive some into the darkness. We need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing. And we have to recognize that \"mental illness\" is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways. People with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment, many can recover and live healthy, productive lives. We must encourage them to open up, and when they do, we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously. It wasn't that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly-kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members, friends and especially employers. But that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer, their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease. Similarly, and with the courageous example of Michael J. Fox, we've seen perceptions about Parkinson's disease change for the better, as people learn more about what it is and isn't. Time to talk about depression . That's the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better-informed public discussion. We have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear. That includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place (through laws and regulations like the Americans for Disabilities Act) for individuals who disclose their disability. We also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk. It's a difficult balance. Sooner rather than later, policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people. At the same time, we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities, families and employers. That can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions. If companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society, we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground. We won't pretend that this is an easy problem to solve. But, awful as Germanwings Flight 9525 tragedy was, the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue. We need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness.",

Phil Haste, 60, was also told he had not shown a pay and display ticket in his car, even though he has a valid car parking permit on his dashboard. The businessman is now refusing to pay the fine that was issued in a Torbay council car park. Scroll down for video . 'Diabolical': Phil Haste (left) said he could not understand why he was issued with a penalty notice, as he clearly had a valid parking permit in his car and no longer required his tax disc to be shown . Mr Haste sent his appeal to the council on Saturday after being issued with the ticket last month and said it was a 'diabolical' decision to fine him. The government abolished paper tax discs on October 1 last year, meaning they no longer need to be shown on a vehicle windscreen. Mr Haste, who lives in Torquay, said: 'I would rather go to court than pay the fine. Issuing tickets of this ilk show they haven't got a clue what they are talking about. 'It's diabolical. The council employ these people to do a job for them and it's clearly not being presented clearly. 'They are obviously trying to just grab money where they can. I don't understand why I got this fine.' 'Haven't got a clue': The 60-year-old was also told he had not shown a pay and display ticket in his car, even though he has a valid car parking permit on his dashboard (pictured) The 60-year-old, who owns the yacht brokers' Quayside Marine, added: 'I don't need a tax disc so I don't know why they issued this. 'I have a car parking permit which was clearly on display on the dashboard of my car, so I just can't understand it.' Torbay Council said it was not their policy to issue fines for road tax offences and urged Mr Haste to appeal. A spokesman said: 'We do not issue parking penalty charge notices with regard to road tax and Mr Haste will have been advised on how to appeal against this ticket as it is stated on the reverse of the penalty charge notice.'",

Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Scannell, Gobern, Coady (Hogg 81), Butterfield, James, Wells (Bunn 88), Miller . Subs not used: Edgar, Murphy, Wallace, Lolley, Billing . Booked: James, Butterfield . Scorers: Gobern 38, Hudson 41, James 45, Wells 72 . Derby (4-4-2): Grant, Shotton, Keogh, Whitbread (Christie 27), Warnock, Hendrick, Hughes (Russell 79), Bryson (Dawkins 9), Ince, Bent, Lingard . Subs not used: Forsyth, Ward, Sammon, Roos . Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.",

Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. However, Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Harry Kane calmly slots Tottenham's third goal in time added on after coming one-on-one with Krul . Kane celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as Spurs claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle . He said: 'He has big potential. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'It's a fantastic achievement and I congratulate him. He deserves this moment because he has worked a lot. It's an historic thing. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' If it was Kane who put the icing on the cake at St James' Park, it was Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat. Chadli fired them in front on the half-hour and after Jack Colback had levelled 20 seconds after the restart, Eriksen scored with a free-kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper Tim Krul. Kane killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st-minute break to leave Pochettino delighted. Tottenham striker Kane at full stretch as he is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . Kane celebrates his goal against Newcastle as opposition goalkeeper Tim Krul looks on in despair . He said: 'We fully deserved the victory and the three points. I think our performance was better than Newcastle's and I am very pleased for our players. 'I am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that wasn't good and it's important to feel victory again.' It proved a difficult day for opposite number John Carver, whose side had to contend not only with Tottenham, but a boycott by some of their own fans. Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Vernon Anita . Carver insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000-capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the Magpies, who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone, are engaged in a survival fight. He said: 'Absolutely, we're in amongst it, there's no danger of that, because you have got sides - and I'll use Leicester as an example - who are winning games. We aren't. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise . Newcastle players join Colback as the hard-working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area . 'But we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board. We have to come up with a solution, I have to come up with a solution. 'I have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye, but I need to find a way of getting some results, getting some points. People might not like what they see, but I'm going to have to do it.' Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at home . Fans applaud Newcastle's goals while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, Not Ashley' sign during the game . Geordie Carver was installed as Alan Pardew's replacement until the end of the season in January, and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since, although he is refusing to throw in the towel. He said: 'It's probably the most difficult situation I have ever been in. But I'm a fighter and I'm not going to shirk anything. I'll take the stick and I'll take the responsibility because that's the type of person I am. 'But I'm not going to give up on it. Yes, I'm angry and I'm annoyed, and I've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private. But I have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it.' A plane hired by the supporters of rivals Sunderland heap misery on Newcastle United . 'We don't demand a team that wins, we demand a team that tries,' reads banner outside St James' Park .",

Had their form since that day been played out through the season \u2014 12 points from 16 games \u2014 they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable.

Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states\u00a0police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8 when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued. The next day the Perth-based former AFL star surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station.",

The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents\u00a0a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, \"Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,\"' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS.\u00a0A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.",

The appalling conditions of a dog training centre where illegal pitbulls covered in scars were forced to wear electric shock collars and train on treadmills has been caught in shocking footage . RSPCA officers discovered the five illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs at a make-shift farm in Lancashire where they had been brutally trained to take part in illegal dog fights .

All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed. Darren Wheatcroft pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan, and farmer Simon Whitworth pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting. All three were handed suspended prison sentences and ordered to pay a total of \u00a340,000 to the RSPCA at Burnley Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.",

A Houston Uber driver arrested and charged last week with sexually assaulting a female passenger was granted approval to drive for the car service despite being a convicted cocaine dealer. Duncan Burton, 57, was released in November 2012 after 14-years behind bars but was allowed to work for Uber despite city controls prohibiting drug felons driving cabs. Burton was taken into custody on Wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years. Uber spokeswoman, Debbee Hancock said on Monday that Burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name. However, according to Uber's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago. That means because Burton was sentence 14-years ago, his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag. Indeed, Burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the US Bureau of Prisons. That information is readily available online by typing in his name. He was convicted in Houston and served time in Louisana and Georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior. According to Houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs. However, they could appeal and still receive one. Burton did not have a city permit to drive a cab and had never applied for an exemption. Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. Last week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks.",

The drug was developed by the British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour, but was shelved after it proved ineffective. Scientists at Yale University in Connecticut in the US have revealed how the treatment, called AZDO5030, restored memory in mice given Alzheimer's disease. An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal\u2019s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is \u00a326billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'",

He tries to be the matador \u2013 sometimes you've got to play one role or the other and this is the time to be the bull and slowly progress, put him in a bad spot and make him fight my fight. 'I've seen little things that he doesn't like \u2013 there's plenty of other fights too that I've seen that show a lot of holes and areas where I can take advantage of. 'You see fights where guys stand in the middle ground too long \u2013 I've just got to make him think about everything. I'm a true mixed martial artist; I have everything to my game. He's got to think about me taking him down, and then my kicks and my punches and everything that I bring to the table. 'Machida has got a very small avenue to win this fight on the feet. Other than that, my avenue is quite big comparably to his.. He doesn't really have much of a chance on the ground. Rockhold performs during an open workout as he bids to extend his winning streak to five . Machida lands a side kick as he works out in front of fans and media . 'I'll be operating at a different frequency than him \u2013 he doesn't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me.' And while Rockhold afforded Machida his respect, he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory. 'I think there is a mutual respect between Machida and me \u2013 I respect what he does,' he said. 'He's one of the best in the game and has been for a long, long time. 'He's right here at the top, where he's been for the whole of his career. He's a martial artist \u2013 he lives by the code. A lot of people love his fighting style, a lot of people hate his fighting style, but you have to respect his fighting style . 'I respect what he does and I like a lot of the things he does. But at the same time, I'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate. 'I've been running marathons every day so I'm ready to go in there and chase him down.' Rockhold's last victory came against Michael Bisping last November in Australia . Machida is also coming off the back of a victory, against CB Dollaway in Brazil . Machida, meanwhile, is confident he can upset Rockhold and earn himself a title shot. 'I think if I apply my style, my technique, I can stop Luke, you know,' he said. 'If I can do my strategy, I can win the fight. 'I know there was another fight in line for the title shot - Jacare vs Yoel Romero \u2013 but now, whoever wins out of me and Luke \u2013 deserves a title shot I think. 'I can see a couple of weaknesses in Luke but it's hard to say before the fight, it's hard to foresee the fight. I have to be there to feel the fight- to see any mistakes he makes. 'I am very well prepared for this fight. I had eight weeks of camp and I had great training. Glover [Teixeira] was there and many, many other fighters. So I am feeling very well, very calm, and I think I can do a great job.'",

Only a year before, he had walked her down the aisle to give her away to her husband, Malcolm Webster, from Surrey, then aged 33, who seemed equally bereft at the loss of his wife. Peter, from\u00a0Gillingham, Kent, believed Claire had died in a tragic accident that happened in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1994. Scroll down for video . Peter Morris, left, was devastated when his sister, Claire, pictured right on her hen do, died in a car crash . It took two decades for the truth to be revealed - Claire had in fact been murdered by Webster so he could cash in on her life insurance. Webster had drugged his wife at their home in the Scottish village of Tarves, where they had settled after their wedding, before taking her for a drive. He then deliberately crashed their car and, after making his own escape, set it on fire so Claire had no hope of survival. Last year Claire's story was turned into an ITV drama starring Sheridan Smith. And now Peter has gone in front of the cameras to talk about his grief and to reveal the shocking detail of his sister's death, which he is still coming to terms with 21 years later. 'The fire brigade said it was the most intense fire they had ever seen from a mile away, the flames were leaping 20, 30 feet, it was just ridiculous,' Peter reveals on the latest episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos. 'A very brave fireman tried to retrieve what was left of Claire. There wasn't much left of her, poor love.' Peter said he was shocked and heartbroken when he was told his sister, a qualified nurse, had lost her life in just terrible circumstances. Claire and Malcolm Webster pictured on their wedding day in 1993, the following year he murdered her . He had no reason to suspect Webster, who Claire had met at a party, had drugged and then burned her alive. Claire had been besotted with him and was delighted when they tied the knot in 1993. Peter recalls: 'He seemed like the perfect gentleman which is exactly what she would have wanted. He was a sort of Colin Firth type character.' He said he and Webster consoled one another at the funeral and Peter believed he was suffering just as much as he was. 'He didn't say a lot at the funeral, he appeared to be in a complete state of shock as well,' he said. 'We were all standing round the graveside, in my right hand I was holding on to Malcolm's left hand. 'I was in floods of tears, and I looked at Malcolm, and he, he was also in floods of tears. And that more than anything else convinced me that it had been a genuine accident.' For years Peter continued to believe the car crash had been accidental, and while some officers who investigated the scene of the crash had their misgivings, they had no concrete evidence to suggest anything different. Felicity Drumm, pictured on Britain's Darkest Taboos, was Webster's second wife. He attempted to kill her in circumstances similar to Claire's death . Peter lost touch with his brother-in-law when Webster moved to New Zealand - but it was there that his true colours were revealed when he tried to murder again. He married Felicity Drumm and they had son together. Unbeknownst to Felicity, he started faking her signature to take out life insurance polices in her name and also began poisoning her like he had done to Claire. Felicity also appears on Britain's Darkest Taboos and reveals how it felt to be drugged. She said: 'These episodes would often begin with a feeling of blurred vision or double vision and unsteadiness on my feet, my speech was sometimes become a little bit slurred, I would stagger around as if I was drunk and then would fall into a deep sleep.' She couldn't believe her husband could be the cause of her illness but a pattern was forming. 'These events occurred after he had prepared a meal or a drink for me, they were always at the weekends, never inconveniently when I had to be able to go to work,' she said. Then in circumstances similar to Claire's death, in 1999 she was driven by Webster to a remote location when she was feeling tired and drowsy. It seems Webster could have been about to commit murder again - until he was interrupted by a phone call from Felicity's concerned parents. Felicity recalls how Webster was angry that the call had woken her up and urged her to ignore it but she persuaded him to drive her home so she could see her father. Webster then fled while Felicity learned some shocking truths from her parents. Webster pictured in 2011 when he was jailed for life after being found guilty of murder . 'We discovered that he'd opened up a private mail box, he had redirected all of our mail including bank mail which had prevented me from discovering that gradually the account was being fleeced,' she said. 'There were enquiries to real estate agents back in the Cornwall and Devon area suggesting he would be returning shortly to the UK with his infant son. At the bottom of his briefcase there was a total of nine life insurance policies, which collectively was in excess of a million dollars on my death, and they had my signature forged on them.' Chillingly, they also discovered a petrol canister in her car and Felicity is convinced she narrowly escaped death that day. Webster went on the run back to the UK while Felicity reported him to the New Zealand police. After investigating, they urged Scottish police to reopen the case into Claire's death. The lead officer in the case was Charles Henry. He said: 'The original fatal road accident was highly suspicious and it bore all the hallmarks of what was happening in New Zealand. At that particular point we were facing a highly dangerous individual who was a threat to any women that he was going to be with.' Felicity pictured in 2011 when she gave evidence against Webster during the trial in which he was dubbed 'the black widower' However, it would take years for the police to build a strong enough case to prove Claire's death was not an accident and gain enough evidence to charge Webster. By then, he was back living in Scotland and was planning to marry another woman who had no idea of his murderous history. In May 2011, after a long running trial during which he was dubbed 'The Black Widower', Webster was found guilty of murdering Claire, attempting to murder Felicity and attempting to bigamously marry a third woman to gain access to her estate. Now aged 55, he is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years. 'I think his sentence aptly reflects the horribleness of his crimes, and the fact that he feels no remorse, that it was all premeditated and, given the opportunity he was about to do it again,' said Felicity, who gave evidence against the father of her child at his trial. Peter, who had to wait 21 years to get justice for Claire, said he and his family can now finally move on even though their lives will never be the same again. Peter says Claire's death nearly destroyed their family but now they are rebuilding their lives . He said: 'If anything it taught me that you just have to be a little bit more cautious in life as to who you trust and when you trust them, because we could all be living next door to the next Malcolm Webster. 'It was an experience that did nearly destroy me and it nearly destroyed my family but thank God it didn't and thank God over a period of time we've managed to put the pieces back together and move on.'

Yesterday, Allie, 21, based in Minneapolis, delivered her beau the ten-question document, which she dubbed 'The Official Allie Davis Relationship Test', and informed him that he must score at least 60 per cent 'to stay in the relationship'. She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter, revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent, for diligently answering questions mainly about Beyonce's songs. Prove it: Allie Davis, 21, (pictured) is so obsessed with Beyonce that yesterday she made her boyfriend take a written exam on the famous singer in order to stay with her . Passed: She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter (pictured), revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent . After a series of questions about Beyonce's songs, and those of other artists, Allie demands: 'Briefly explain the Solange Knowles elevator incident. Who was involved?' Allie's very obedient boyfriend scrawled in response: 'A billion dollars, and Jay Z got punched.' This question referred to last year's legendary family fracas at New York's Met Gala, when Beyonce's sister Solange Knowles viciously attacked Beyonce's husband Jay Z following a heated row. Beyonce, 33, later mysteriously sang in her Flawless remix with fellow songstress Nicki Minaj: 'Of course sometimes s**t goes down when there\u2019s a billion dollars on an elevator.' After a series of questions about Beyonce's songs, and those of other artists, Allie demands, 'Briefly explain the Solange Knowles elevator incident. Who was involved?' Allie also dropped in a few questions about some of her other famous popstars, One Direction included . Allie's Twitter bio reads 'I met Beyonce [left] at Top Shop and life will never be the same', and the young blonde also appears to be quite the fan of One Direction's Harry Styles (right) Allie - whose Twitter bio reads 'I met Beyonce at Top Shop and life will never be the same' - also dropped in a few questions about some of her other famous popstars, One Direction included. Asked to list the first names of three members of the British boy band, Allie's boyfriend incorrectly answered with 'Harry' and 'Zack' - to which Allie wrote on the sheet of paper: 'WTF No.' He did manage to get the last question on the exam right, however, by correctly identifying that 'no', Harry Styles should not cut his hair. Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves, 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship.' Sharing is caring: Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves (pictured), 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship' At least one commentator took the stunt very seriously, writing on Buzzfeed: 'Dump her ass... this is a HUGE warning sign. [Don't] put up with this kind of deluded psycho act.' Allie then explained in her defence: 'It literally took five minutes to write and I did it because I was bored and I like to mess with my boyfriend.' She later added: 'When some people call you nuts and psychotic because of a funny Beyonce joke #lightenup'.",

Led magnificently by John Terry, Jose Mourinho\u2019s side have proved once again that a solid back four is the bedrock of any title challenge. From the meanest to the most successful, Sportsmail\u00a0takes a look at the best defences in Premier League history. John Terry (centre), Gary Cahill (left) and Branislav Ivanovic celebrate Chelsea's goalless draw at Arsenal . ARSENAL 1997-98... Lee Dixon, Tony Adams, Steve Bould/Martin Keown, Nigel Winterburn . These rear Gunners might have been getting a little long in the tooth, but it didn\u2019t stop them delivering the Double for Arsene Wenger in his first full season in English football. They conceded 33 Premier League goals along the way as they pipped Manchester United to the title. Tony Adams was the main man in a fiercely solid unit that had been forged under George Graham. They knew each other\u2019s game inside out and few defences down the years could match this one for experience and knowhow. (From left) Steve Bould, Tony Adams, Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon celebrate the title . ARSENAL 2003-04... Lauren, Kolo Toure, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole . Six years on and it was an entirely new Arsenal backline that will forever be lauded for their contribution to the Invicibles, Wenger\u2019s team that amazingly went unbeaten on their way to the title in 2004. The Gunners conceded only 26 goals in the process as they finished 11 points clear of Chelsea. Campbell had succeeded Adams as the kingpin and they had more attack-minded full backs in Cole and Lauren, but the old defensive steel was as strong as ever. Lauren, Kolo Toure, Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole (not pictured) formed one of the league's best defences . Campbell played alongside Toure in the season Arsenal went unbeaten as Cole and Lauren (right) confront Phil Neville after their side's infamous 0-0 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2003 . CHELSEA 2004-05... Paulo Ferreira, John Terry, William Gallas, Ricardo Carvalho . No team in Premier League history has conceded fewer goals than Mourinho\u2019s side in his first season in England after the Portuguese coach moved to Stamford Bridge fresh from his Champions League triumph with Porto. Chelsea\u2019s defence was breached just 15 times as they won the title with 95 points, another Premier League record. Mourinho brought Ferreira and Carvalho with him from Porto and the effect was instant. William Gallas and John Terry celebrate after the latter scored for Chelsea in a 4-1 win against West Ham . MANCHESTER UNITED 1998-99... Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Ronny Johnsen, Denis Irwin . United\u2019s Treble winners were not the meanest by any stretch, letting in 37 goals in 1999 compared with the 17 conceded by nearest challengers Arsenal. But the attacking instincts of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s side always meant it was going to be a case of \u2018we\u2019ll score more goals than you\u2019, as was evident in the two 3-3 draws with Barcelona that season. Ferguson has since said that Irwin would be the only certain inclusion in a best XI picked from his time at Old Trafford, while selling Stam was arguably his biggest regret. Either way, this back four deserves their place in the hall of fame on the basis of the club\u2019s Treble achievement. Jaap Staam (centre) and Gary Neville (right), pictured with David Beckham and Dwight Yorke (top), formed half of United's Treble-winning defence. Denis Irwin played at left back with Ronny Johnsen partnering Stam . MANCHESTER UNITED 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09: Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra . This was an altogether more compact United, conceding an average of 24 goals on their way to winning the title three years in a row. Has there ever been a better bit of January transfer business than the two deals United completed in 2006 to sign Vidic and Evra from Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively?\u00a0Vidic teamed up with the majestic Ferdinand to forge one of the great central defensive partnerships, playing together in three Champions League finals, while Neville was still going strong at right back. Nani's celebration is overlooked by Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand in the summer of 2007 . Ferdinand's partnership with Vidic helped Manchester United to successive titles in 2007, 2008 and 2009 . MANCHESTER CITY 20011-12: Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Joleon Lescott, Aleksandar Kolarov . Manchester City\u2019s success in conceding only 29 goals was ultimately crucial in snatching the title away from United on goal difference after an unforgettable final day of the season in 2012. Kompany, who lifted the trophy, was well on his way to establishing himself as a City legend, as was Zabaleta. Both players had been signed by Mark Hughes, along with Lescott, but the defensive nous of Italian Roberto Mancini helped turn City into a more solid unit before he brought in the combative Kolarov from Lazio. Vincent Kompany is mobbed by his defensive partner\u00a0Aleksandar Kolarov after scoring against Liverpool .",

A US air base near Kabul and military outposts in Nuristan were targeted today as the militants continue to pursue territory in north east Afghanistan. According to the official spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, over 80 per cent of Afghanistan is currently 'controlled' by the Taliban. Whilst their figures are exaggerated, the Taliban's new offensive is set to the start of fresh violence in the troubled country. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. The rocket landed harmlessly in base and despite the Taliban claims that they had 'killed and wounded hundreds of Americans', no casualties have been reported. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were also reportedly detonated in Kunar and Khost province. Casualty numbers remain unconfirmed but the attacks symbolize a worrying indicator of the broad areas being targeted by the Taliban. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces. The Taliban have been waging an jihadi insurgency since they were forced out of power in late 2001. With the emergence of ISIS, the Taliban are already facing a struggle for power in Afghanistan. The extremists want to turn Afghanistan into an Islamic Emirate, governed by strict sharia law. In December, photos emerged of a robber being publicly executed by Taliban fighters with machine guns. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces in what is expected to be the bloodiest fighting season in a decade. With NATO forces pulling back from the frontlines, concerns remain whether trained Afghan forces will be able to consistently repel the expected barrage of Taliban attacks. 'The Islamic Emirate is going to launch the spring operations under the inspirational name of 'Azm' (Determination) at 5 am on 24th April 2015,' the Taliban said in a statement on Wednesday, using their official name. 'The main targets of these operations... will be the foreign occupiers, especially their permanent military bases... officials of the stooge regime, their military constellations, especially their intelligence, interior ministry and defence ministry officials.' Former Afghan Taliban fighters are seen holding weapons before they hand them over, as part of a government peace and reconciliation initiative, at a ceremony in Jalalabad recently. NATO's combat mission formally ended in December but a small follow-up foreign force has stayed on to train and support local security personnel. US President Barack Obama last month backpedaled on plans to shrink the US force in Afghanistan this year by nearly half, agreeing to keep the current level of 9,800 US troops until the end of 2015. The Taliban, who have waged a deadly insurgency since they were ousted from power in late 2001, said the announcement would damage any prospect of peace talks as they vowed to continue fighting. Aside from the Taliban, the Afghan government has also repeatedly warned of the Islamic State (IS) group making inroads into the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. If verified, that would mark the first major attack by the jihadists in the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. Afghan security forces are struggling to cope with the new offensive across Afghanistan \u00a0particularly with the gradual withdrawal of NATO forces . The upsurge in attacks has taken a heavy toll on ordinary Afghans. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the number of civilians killed and wounded up by 22 percent in 2014 compared to the previous year. In the first three months of 2015, civilian casualties from ground fighting were up eight percent on the same period last year, a new UNAMA report said. But in their statement, the Taliban said their 'top priority will be given to safeguard and protect the lives and properties of the civilian people' during the offensive.

Micheal John Duffy, 34, pleaded not guilty to murdering Colleen Deborah Ayers, 33, whose decomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property, located near Picton, south west of Sydney. In the opening statements of Duffy's trial Crown prosecutor Elizabeth Wilkins SC told the jury,\u00a0that while his former partner, Rachel Evans, had initiated the violent act, Duffy had willingly joined in. He claimed his co-accused, Evans, was the one who had a 'twisted desire to kill' and he had only helped bury Ms Ayers' body. Micheal John Duffy pleaded not guilty to killing Colleen Deborah Ayers after claiming he had only disposed of her body while his co-accused Rachel Evans was the one with a 'twisted desire to kill' Ms Wilkins told the court Evans was the one who grabbed the belt used to strangle Ms Ayers after telling a witness: 'We are going to kill her, we are going to kill her.' 'She put the belt around Ms Ayers' neck. The deceased bucked her off.' 'It was at that stage that the accused Duffy intervened and also started strangling her,' she said. 'This was Rachael Evans' idea. She was the ringleader and this accused [Duffy] joined in.' The court heard Ms Ayers had met Evans at a pub in Campbelltown only a day before she was gruesomely murdered. It is alleged on May 8, 2012, Evans and Duffy, along with a 16-year-old girl who can not be named, went to a hotel in Picton with  Ms Ayers. Evans, Duffy and Ms Ayers then proceeded to have sex with each other while the unidentified teenager filmed the act. The next day, after drinking and taking the drug ice, Ms Ayers invited the duo, along with another man, Scott Debridge, to her parents empty Lakesland property. Ms Wilkins told the court Evans and Duffy had planned to steal and sell firearms from the rural property so they could buy drugs. Courthouse: Duffy's co-accused Evans, who has plead guilty to murder, \u00a0will receive a reduced sentence for giving evidence at her former lover's trial . Later that night, after Evans had been 'cutting up' ice, she heard Duffy and Ms Ayers having sex. The 16-year-old witness said Evans became agitated and armed herself with the leather belt. The court heard Evans then entered the bedroom and started strangling the victim. It was at this point, the crown said, Duffy joined in. Ms Wilkins said once Ms Ayers was dead, Evans dragged her body into the bathroom so she could try to wash away Duffy's DNA. Meanwhile, Duffy and Debridge went to a dam on the property to dispose of the body where they dug a shallow grave and buried Ms Ayers. During his trial, Debridge claimed he tried to refuse the orders to dig the grave, however, Duffy 'bashed' him with a shovel until he continued. After Ms Ayers' body was buried the group proceeded to ransack her parents house, stealing jewellery, an Xbox and, as planned, the firearms. It is reported the group left in a maxi taxi at about 7.40am on May 10. In a chilling revelation, Evans then allegedly told the cab driver she had a 'very exhilarating night'. Ms Ayers wasn't reported missing until May 25, when her parents returned home from holidays to the Lakesland property, where their daughter's body was secretly buried. Ms Ayers'\u00a0discomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property in 2012 . Police finally caught up with Evans on May 31, after her parents spent a week wondering where their daughter could be. Evans took officers to the property and showed them where Ms Ayers was buried. She reportedly told the young witness she felt no remorse for the killing. 'I feel good. I don't feel guilty. The f***ing belt buckle snapped. When I was burying her I started hitting her with the shovel. It felt so good,' the Daily Telegraph reported. During her trial it was revealed Evans sent fan mail to infamous murderer Ivan Milat and bragged to the unidentified teen-aged witness that she would become a 'serial killer' in years to come. Evans has plead guilty to murder and Debridge to being an accessory after the fact, with both receiving discounts on their sentences for giving evidence during Duffy's continuing trial.

Inside the Juventus Stadium, with 2,000 travelling England fans seated in the curva at the north west area, there was more of the same. England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's friendly draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . Michael Carrick (centre) and the rest of the England squad applaud the travelling support in Turin on Tuesday . Frankly, it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good-natured and good-humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to June\u2019s friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. It also places a strain on the FA. What can they do when thousands of travelling fans are singing: \u2018Where were you in World War Two,\u2019 or the German bomber song that has been heard for many years on our overseas trips? Toe-curling stuff. As for the IRA songs, many of the younger fans who join in with these chants cannot know or understand the significance of the Irish political situation and how it affected Britain through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties. In Dublin there will be the issue of provocation, the potential to engage with a city that has traditionally been a political hotspot.There is barely time to catch our breath before England\u2019s 3,000 supporters head to the Aviva Stadium for the first fixture against the Republic of Ireland since 1995. It was at Lansdowne Road on February 15 that year when rioting England fans - many of them associated with the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 - caused the fixture with Jack Charlton\u2019s side to be abandoned. England supporters throw missiles at Landsdowne Road 20 years ago, causing the fixture to be abandoned . In the intervening years there have been various conversations between the FA and the FA of Ireland about a fixture between the teams, but it is only now they can agree that the time is right. Let\u2019s not spoil it. The fixture with Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s labouring team on June 7 is a bookend to the season ahead of the final chapter in Slovenia seven days later. Roy Hodgson is a football man and you can tell by his pained expression at the end of every post-match briefing that he would rather not be answering questions about fans\u2019 behaviour. \u2018We can only hope that in some way we put that right before we go to Ireland because the last thing we want is anything (other) than a very good football match,\u2019 he said after the 1-1 draw with Italy. This is an awkward situation for the FA and yesterday they were reluctant to release another statement condemning the anti-IRA chanting as there is no evidence that it has had a positive effect. It seems by Roy Hodgson's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the England boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans' behaviour . The first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to Celtic Park in November, when England emerged with an uplifting 3-1 victory over Scotland. Life felt good. That was until Hodgson, underprepared for a question about the nature of the chants, answered one with some assistance from a diplomatic member of the FA\u2019s communications team. The FA attempted to defuse the situation by releasing a statement the following day apologising for the behaviour of \u2018a section of the England support\u2019. It read: \u2018We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective.\u2019 The songs were sung in England's win against Scotland and the FA wanted to make sure they stopped in Turin\u00a0- there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . The FA are in a tricky position because they are getting hammered by the travelling fans at every away game for the \u2018two caps for Wembley\u2019 loyalty scheme. Previously, those who travelled to watch England were rewarded with double the \u2018caps\u2019, giving greater access to restricted-allocation European Championship and World Cup tickets. Now, fans who attend home games get twice the points instead. The FA would do well to take a closer look at this policy in an effort to placate the supporters. Is it a fair trade? Probably not, but then it isn\u2019t equitable to inflict anti-IRA songs on the people of Ireland the day before kick-off at the Aviva Stadium, either.",

They have not taken advantage of it by not scoring or converting chances. They've paid the ultimate price in the end. That's this level for you. 'There are critical moments and if you don't take them, they're very costly indeed. Performances are always important, but in the end it's a results business.'

The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin. 'He got up and resumed teaching after the demo was over. Looked uncomfortable, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do,' Mubarak said.",

An early strike from Neymar and second-half brace from Luis Suarez sealed victory for Barcelona and placed the Catalan outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Blanc admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended Marco Verratti and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while PSG were also unable to start with David Luiz and saw Thiago Silva hobble off in the early stages. Luis Suarez eases past David Luiz en route to scoring his second goal of the Champions League tie . Gerard Pique leads the celebrations after Barcelona secured a 3-1 victory in Paris on Wednesday night . 'I'm not going to make excuses about us being depleted,' said Blanc. 'I'm not doing that. We put a team out there, but we were dominated by Barcelona. 'It's only six days until the second leg, with a league game in between, so it's a 'short week' for people to recover. I think Barcelona were fitter than us. We had players who weren't at 100 per cent, and also a lot of absentees, but that should have been a motivation for us. We never controlled the ball well enough, and Barca were better than us in virtually every department. 'We will have the suspended players back next week, and that is an incentive. We'll try and put on a better show than we did tonight. They were better than us tonight and scored three goals. We'll try and show a different PSG at Barcelona next week. Hopefully we will achieve a different result.' Laurent Blanc made no excuses for his side as they now face elimination from the Champions League . David Luiz, who started the game from the substitutes' bench, endured a night to forget in the French capital . In the end, the Frenchman was relieved to escape only 3-1 down. 'It didn't end up as bad as it might have done, but the players are very disappointed with the way it went,' he said. 'We gave the impression we gave Barcelona the kind of game they wanted to pay. They made life difficult for us on the counter-attack and have players who can be very dangerous.' Barcelona manager Luis Enrique was delighted with his side's showing and reserved special praise for Suarez. 'Suarez is special in his own way,' Enrique said, 'Look at the goals he scored for Ajax and Liverpool. He is very strong and finishes so well. But it wasn't just about Luis Suarez tonight. We were superb in defence, midfield and attack.'",

But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for \u00a34.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges \u00a328 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs \u00a319.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include\u00a0the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over \u00a333million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another \u00a31.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.",

Activists in the Missouri suburb, protesting over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop, were also known as 'adversaries', according to internal briefings seen by CNN\u00a0this week. The National Guard was first activated in Ferguson in August after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency when riots and looting broke out amid peaceful demonstrations over police brutality. National Guard soldiers secure the police command center in Ferguson, Missouri, on November 27 last year. An internal report has revealed that the heavily-militarized guard referred to  protesters as 'enemy forces' The guard were activated again in November ahead of the November 24 decision by a St Louis grand jury who decided not to indict the officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. Many in the community accused the National Guard of making an already tense situation worse. Guardsmen were seen rolling through the streets of the suburb in tanks wearing combat gear and carrying assault rifles. Missouri National Guard described some  on the streets as 'enemy forces' including the KKK, the RgB Black Rebels and the New Black Panther Party - \u00a0but also the 'general protesters'. According to CNN, National Guard supervisors were worried about how they were being viewed by the public and asked guardsmen to tone down the heavily militarized language. Officers were told by superiors to change references to 'enemy' to 'criminal elements' instead. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a response from the Missouri National Guard on Friday. Brown's shooting stirred long-simmering racial tensions in the St. Louis suburb, where two-thirds of the residents are black but the police force is almost entirely white. Rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily-armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions. At times, protesters lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, who fired tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds. At the time of the Guard's deployment in November,\u00a0St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said he supported Nixon's decision to activate the Guard. 'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting directly with demonstrators,' Slay said. Protesters flip over a Ferguson police car on November 25, 2014. Missouri's governor ordered hundreds more National Guard troops to the St Louis suburb following the grand jury's decision not to indict white cop Darren Wilson over the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown .",

The woman in her mid- to late 30s, who is believed to have had two or three children participating, was at Melbourne\u2019s Greatest Ever Easter Egg Hunt, which was run by Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation at\u00a0Caulfield Racecourse on Saturday. She was escorted out of the racecourse, in Melbourne's south-east, when she became 'irate' after a young volunteer at the hunt asked her to stop taking so many Easter eggs. Scroll down for video . A greedy mother at a charity Easter egg hunt was booted out of the event after she swore at volunteers . Event organiser Allan Turner said gluttonous parents were a major problem at the event who took in additional bags and even prams to fill up with chocolate. The aim of the hunt is to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation, while raising money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation. More than 2,500 chocolate lovers paid $5 to fill up their bucket with as many eggs as they could fit on Saturday. 'This is the fourth year we've done the event and we have problems with parents sneaking in shopping bags and filling them up to the top,' Mr Turner told Daily Mail Australia. She was told by a 13-year-old volunteer she was taking too many eggs and she told the young person to 'f*** off' The woman kept denying she was smuggling eggs into additional plastic bags she had brought in . 'Parents are the toughest ones to control. You expect the kids to go frantic and shove eggs into their pockets and shirts and pants. But when parents go past this level of gluttony, it\u2019s not a good look.' Mr Turner said they had to create a pram parking area outside the hunting spot to stop adults from smuggling eggs out by hiding them inside baby carriages. But he said this was the first year he had security guards escort a parent off site because they were taking too many of the 250,000 eggs donated by Hillier's Chocolates. He said one of volunteers approached him on the day and told him a woman was throwing obscenities at her when they asked her to stop stuffing multiple bags full with treats. '[The woman] was saying \"I've not done it\"... [but] she had definitely filled up a number of bags to the hilt, more than people paying $5 a bucket,' Mr Turner said. 'She got irate and started carrying on and started having a go at my young volunteer who was only 13 years old. 'She was using the f-word, saying \"You can't stop from f***ing doing this and f*** off\".' It was not the first time parents took more than their fair share - which is a $5 bucket full - but this is the first time organisers have had to kick someone out . The egg hunt looks to raise money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation, which helps bring awareness of tissue and organ donation to the forefront . It was started by Zaidee Turner's father, Allan, who wanted to honour his seven-year-old daughter who was an organ donor when she died . Mr Turner said it was a shame this woman had acted in this way as she was at a family event, which he had started in the honour of his daughter, Zaidee, who died of a brain anuerysm when she seven years old. He said Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation tried to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation. At the time of her death, Mr Turner said Zaidee was one of the youngest people in Victoria to be on the donor list, saving the lives of up to seven people. Zaidee (not pictured) died of a brain aneurysm in 2004 and she has been remembered through the hunt . Mr Turner said parents were often the most difficult to control at these hunts as they were scrambling to get as many eggs as possible . Organisers have had to stop parents bringing prams because they were using them to smuggle out eggs . 'We try to [do events] left of field for organ and tissue donation,' he said. 'We've had jockey breeches with rainbow stripes on the side, we've done that for a number of years where [jockeys] wear them at race events and we came up with the idea of Melbourne's Greatest Easter Egg Hunt. 'It's Melbourne\u2019s biggest Easter egg hunt and it raises much needed funds in an area where there are benefits for young and old.'",

The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14\u00a0Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino\u2019s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. \u2018He deserved it,\u2019 he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. \u2018He has the quality,\u2019 he said. \u2018So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).\u2019 Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. \u2018It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,\u2019 Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City\u2019s recent defeat here and complained that \u2018long balls into the box\u2019 made Sean Dyche\u2019s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal\u2019s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. \u2018Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??\u2019 tweeted Darren Anderton. Captain Kane pictured in the tunnel beforehand with his Tottenham team as they prepared for the match with Burnley . It was the first time Kane has been captain this season for Tottenham as manager Mauricio Pochettino put his faith in the young striker . Kyle Walker receives treatment on the pitch before he was forced off through injury and replaced by Ben Davies for Tottenham . Walker was forced off through injury in the second half as Tottenham chased the win against Burnley at Turf Moor . Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game \u2014 they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England\u2019s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham\u2019s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson\u2019s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team\u2019s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

Burnley striker Danny Ings stands with hands on hips as he failed to score during the Premier League stalemate at Turf Moor . It was Boyd\u2019s industry that created the first decent chance of the game, the pressure he applied on Ryan Mason forcing the newly capped England player into directing a back-pass into the path of Ings. The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. \u2018I think we edged the game,\u2019 said Dyche afterwards. \u2018Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he\u2019s probably just hit too cleanly. But I\u2019m pleased by the fact that we\u2019ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.\u2019 Not that there was much evidence of that here.

Mourinho planned for Kurt Zouma to man mark Fellaini - with teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek playing the 6ft 4in midfielder in training. But he feared his tactical master plan was set to be for nothing when he was told that the United powerhouse was not playing by the doorman at the club's hotel.

She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter, revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent, for diligently answering questions mainly about Beyonce's songs. Prove it: Allie Davis, 21, (pictured) is so obsessed with Beyonce that yesterday she made her boyfriend take a written exam on the famous singer in order to stay with her . Passed: She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter (pictured), revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent . After a series of questions about Beyonce's songs, and those of other artists, Allie demands: 'Briefly explain the Solange Knowles elevator incident. Who was involved?' Allie's very obedient boyfriend scrawled in response: 'A billion dollars, and Jay Z got punched.' This question referred to last year's legendary family fracas at New York's Met Gala, when Beyonce's sister Solange Knowles viciously attacked Beyonce's husband Jay Z following a heated row. Beyonce, 33, later mysteriously sang in her Flawless remix with fellow songstress Nicki Minaj: 'Of course sometimes s**t goes down when there\u2019s a billion dollars on an elevator.'

Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves, 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship.' Sharing is caring: Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves (pictured), 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship' At least one commentator took the stunt very seriously, writing on Buzzfeed: 'Dump her ass... this is a HUGE warning sign. [Don't] put up with this kind of deluded psycho act.' Allie then explained in her defence: 'It literally took five minutes to write and I did it because I was bored and I like to mess with my boyfriend.' She later added: 'When some people call you nuts and psychotic because of a funny Beyonce joke #lightenup'.",

'Revenge': Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, has been sentenced to life in prison after shooting dead Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon (both pictured), 39, because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. The defendant was told that he will not be eligible for parole for 35 years . Crash: Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, received a nine-month sentence. Above, a newspaper photo of the crash . After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home on St Mary's Road, near the town of Montague,\u00a0CTV News reported. He shot them both in 'execution-style' killings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the crash that had claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago. In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. At the time, he told the court that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. He added he had needed to do something for her. 'Call me a cold-blooded killer, but I'm not,' he said. Before his sentencing on Monday, Vuozzo said Herbert's 'short' sentence 'has haunted me all my life', saying: 'That's all her life was worth. She only had nine years in this world. And nobody cared.' Shooting: After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home near Montague, Prince Edward Island, and shot them. Above, police at the scene . Emergency vehicle: He killed both in 'execution-style' slayings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the car crash that claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago . However, Crown lawyer John Diamond told the provincial Supreme Court in Charlottetown that Vuozzo was a 'cold-hearted' murderer who had shot his victims with a handgun to get 'revenge'. 'It was revenge. He was a cold-hearted and calculated individual,' he told the court,\u00a0CBC reported. Mr Diamond also called the double-murder on August 20 'callous', 'pointless', and the worst crime in the Island's history, adding that it has caused life-long pain for surviving McGuigan family members. In a victim impact statement, Brent's wife and Brendon's mother, Marie McGuigan, who was home at the time but was not targeted by a hell-bent Vuozzo, said 'a part of me died with them that night'. Attack: In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. He said that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. Above, the scene of the killings . Meanwhile, Brent's only daughter, Donna, said she has been consumed by hatred. 'I feel so much anger and hatred that it scares me. I hate that they died this way and it haunts me,' she sobbed. At an earlier hearing, Gerald Quinn, prosecuting, explained how Cathy had been fatally thrown from a car being driven by her father when it was struck by Mr McGuigan, who was driving a truck, in 1970. The youngster's father and two other children also received minor injuries in the crash, but Herbert was not injured,\u00a0The Eastern Graphic\u00a0reported.\u00a0Cathy died on the scene near Commercial Road. Mr McGuigan has since passed away. Referring to Brent and Brendon, Quinn said: 'These two men, by all accounts, were good hard-working men, had no involvement whatsoever in the motor vehicle accident years ago, at all. He added: 'This gentlemen [Vuozzo] had no familiarity with them other than knowing who they were.\u00a0He walked into the home and he shot them both multiple times and killed them.' Thane MacEachern, defending, argued that the defendant had no previous criminal record and had suffered from depression and mental illness prior to the shootings, according to\u00a0CBC. Vuozzo, of Lower Montague, will be 81 by the time he is\u00a0eligible\u00a0for parole. The first 25 years' ineligibility are for his first-degree murder charge, while the other 10 years are for killing Brendon. In 2011, federal legislation was passed allowing courts to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility in cases where defendants have been convicted of multiple murders.",

Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury . It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries . Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time. Leeds were not available for comment.",

But new research has revealed that females may actually be better at mastering the use of tools - at least among chimpanzees. Researchers have found that female chimps are more likely to use the tools to help them hunt for food while males tend to prefer capturing prey with their hands. Scroll down for video . Primatologists at Iowa State University recorded 300 hunts by chimps in Fongoli, S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, and found female chimps were using tools to capture prey in 60 per cent of the observations. This female chimp has stripped a stick of leaves and uses it to flush out a bush baby from a hollow tree trunk . While the findings may provoke some to reassess their view of the opposite sex, the research may also provide tantalising hints at how humans first learned to use weapons to hunt. It suggests that early female humans were perhaps the first to begin fashioning simple tools to help them catch prey. It has been known that chimpanzees use tools like humans for more than 50 years. In 1960, Jane Goodall witnessed two chimps using twigs to fish for termites in the ground. This was the first time that an animal was observed to make a tool and use it for a specific purpose, other than humans. It was later found that the Gombe chimps use twigs, leaves and rocks in nine different ways to feed, drink, clean themselves, reach other objects and to fashion weapons. In communities outside Gombe National Park, communities make different tools. Chimpanzees make sponges by chewing leaves and dipping them into puddles of water so they can use them as drinking vessels. They have been observed using sticks and rocks to smash fruit and shells. Adult males sometimes hurl rocks and sticks like make-shift spears to intimidate rivals. This study said that chimps use  shoots from Alchornea hirtella to hunt aggressive army ants in a specific way. It is thought that the behaviour is passed from one generation to the next and is learned by young chimpanzees. Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Dr Jill Pruetz, a primatologist at Iowa State University said: 'Savannah-dwelling chimpanzees at Fongoli, S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, are the only non-human population known to systematically hunt vertebrate prey with tools. 'Acquiring vertebrate prey via tool use at Fongoli supports the hypothesis that early hominins intensified their tool technology to overcome environmental pressures and that even the earliest hominins were probably sophisticated enough to fashion tools for hunting. 'The behaviour of these chimpanzees demonstrates that hunting is less adult male-biased among our closest living relatives than previously believed when tools are used. 'If tool use enabled early hominins to reduce the need for physical characteristics (i.e. greater size, strength) to achieve hunting efficiency, such sexual dimorphism ultimately becomes less important regarding prey acquisition.' Scientists first reported chimps using spear-like sticks to hunt prey at Fongoli in Senegal in 2007, and it was later filmed by the BBC in their hugely successful natural history series Life Story. Over the following years Dr Pruetz and her team have recorded 308 hunts using tools. Tools tended to be used when the chimps were hunting bush babies, called Galago. When Dr Pruetz and her colleagues analysed the hunts they had recorded, however, they found that more of them tended to be carried out by female chimps. The findings were surprising as most hunting behaviour is conducted by males and overall they account for 70 per cent of all prey captured. The chimps at Fongoli in Senegal (shown above) are the only animals to regularly hunt for prey with tools.\u00a0Scientists first reported chimps using spear-like sticks to hunt prey at Fongoli in Senegal in 2007, and it was later filmed by the BBC in their hugely successful natural history series Life Story . Researchers observed more female chimps using broken sticks like above to help them capture prey.\u00a0However, the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands . However, the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands. Females carried out 61 per cent of the hunts using tools. They found that even in hunts involving tools, male chimps would often capture prey driven into their hands by those wielding tools. Dr Pruetz added: 'What would often happen is the male would be in the vicinity of another chimp hunting with a tool, often a female, and the bush baby was able to escape the female and the male grabbed the bush baby as it fled.' She added: 'It's just another example of diversity in chimp behavior that we keep finding the longer we study wild chimps.' Other groups of chimpanzees have been seen to use tools in other ways to help them gather hard to reach food - such as using sticks to 'fish' for termites. Again these activities tend to be dominated by females, but Dr Pruetz said it could not be easily compared to the hunting behaviour seen at Fongoli. She said: 'Fishing for termites is a very different activity than jabbing for a bush baby.' Tool use by chimpanzees is now considered to be fairly widespread with many groups having been observed using stones or sticks to crack open nuts, fish for termites and in some cases to capture small mammals . 'With fishing, termites grab on to a twig and don't let go and the chimp eats the termites off the twig. 'When hunting, the bush baby tries to bite, escape or hide from the chimp. The chimps are really averse to being bitten by a bush baby.' Instead she believes there is something very specific about the open Savannah environment compared to forests that has driven the chimps living at Fongoli to use tools in this way. She said that hunting bush babies with tools may be a way of allowing them to get access to a highly nutritious food source without having to chase down their prey. Something similar may have happened with early humans as their environment changed to become more Savannah like. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'The Savannah environment might be viewed as the catalyst for tool-assisted hunting by Savannah chimpanzees in S\u00e9n\u00e9gal in that apes here exploit prey that is largely ignored by forest-dwelling chimpanzees. 'Chimpanzees' preferred prey at other sites, the red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus badius) is absent in the dry, open Savannah-woodland at Fongoli. 'Galago hunting at Fongoli represents a high-energy, low-risk resource that members of various age\u2013sex classes can take advantage of, similar to what is observed among tool-equipped human hunters. 'Additionally, typical adult male chimpanzee arboreal hunting behaviour was unlikely to be characteristic of early bipedal hominins given the latter's anatomical differences with living apes. 'With such anatomical changes in our lineage, tool use probably became increasingly important to hunting behaviour.'",

Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty\u2019s Spring Heeled in the Crabbie\u2019s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner, who was pulled up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the \u00a31million race. But the champion trainer  said on Wednesday it was unfair to tie Scholfield down to a gelding which is far from certain to run when the mount on another leading definite contender is being offered. Scholfield, who has ridden in six Nationals and finished third in 2013 on Teaforthree, will travel to Ireland to sit on Spring Heeled at Culloty\u2019s County Cork stable on Friday. Nicholls said: \u2018I have not made up my mind if I am going to run Sam Winner yet and Nick needed a decision. \u2018I did not want to get into a situation next week when I had to say \"sorry mate, he is not running\" and did not want to stop him getting a good ride. \u2018I have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at Cheltenham. That will happen over the weekend and early next week. I don\u2019t want to run unless I am really happy. \u2018I have plenty of other lads who could ride Sam Winner if he runs and would not be afraid to use Will Biddick or Harry Skelton.\u2019 Spring Heeled (right) wins the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at Cheltenham last year . Spring Heeled, winner of Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at last season\u2019s Cheltenham Festival, has been given a National preparation. The eight-year-old has run only once since finishing fourth to Road To Riches in the Galway Plate in July when he was fourth of five in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February. Racemail revealed on Wednesday that Culloty would have two runners in the National. Robbie McNamara will ride his 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere. Scholfield rides Teaforthree (front) as the horse jumps the last fence at Aintree in the 2013 Grand National . McNamara said: \u2018It's a great ride to get and I'm looking forward to it. I've ridden him before in a Grade One in Leopardstown and I was supposed to ride him in the Hennessy there as well, but I broke my collarbone the day before. I'm delighted to get back on him.\u2019 With Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Double Ross another confirmed non runner, David Pipe\u2019s well supported Soll appears guaranteed a run at the bottom of the weights.

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as \u00a36,000 each \u2013 far more than the \u00a328 fee that Sweden\u2019s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world\u2019s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium\u2019s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just \u00a39, while Turkey has the most expensive at \u00a3166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries \u2013 the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US \u2013 but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just \u00a328 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn\u2019t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world \u2013 behind Sweden, Finland and Germany \u2013 with a fee of \u00a373. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's \u00a333 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.",

The broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of Mr Engel, which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed, was carried out by forces associated with President Bashar-al Assad. But Mr Engel has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a Sunni group who had tried to convince their victims that they were Shi-ite rebels affiliated to the Government. Scroll down for video . NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel (centre) was taken captive with Turkey reporter Aziz Akyavas (left) and photographer John Kooistra (right) and were convinced by their captors they had been taken by forces related to President Bashar al-Assad, but they may have been Sunni rebels instead . A statement posted on the NBC News site said: 'The group that kidnapped us put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite Shabiha militiamen.\u00a0The group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances.' The statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight, as they were told, this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes. Instead the captives may just have been handed over. The statement added: 'We have not been able to get a definitive account of what happened that night. But based on all of our reporting, it is clear that we were kidnapped by a criminal gang for money and released for propaganda purposes. 'This, of course, does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous. It does, however, underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside Syria.' Mr Engel and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the New York Times raised questions over the attackers' identities. They suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a Sunni criminal element of the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army and known for taking hostages. The New York Times claimed that NBC executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers' identities during and after Mr Engel was taken. Mr Engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces . But immediately after his release Mr Engel appeared on Today and in a Vanity Fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group, government militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. He made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors, which included that they had been rescued by Sunni rebels. The paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the Assad regime. Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra, were taken hostage on December 13, 2012, while reporting in Syria. The foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a Syrian rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see Iranian and Lebanese prisoners being held by rebels. Syrians run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the Bustan Al-Qasr district of Aleppo . They were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound, blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes. The kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress GPS signal, which informed NBC exactly where they were. \u00a0NBC was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world, also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location. Engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall behind them. It read: \u2018Or will burn.\u2019 A statement published by NBC said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes . During the five days they were held Mr Engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot, and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last. He claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers.\u00a0As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. On the fifth night they were loaded, while blindfolded, into a van. They were told they would be handed over to military forces in  Foua. As they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor.

The winning duo - announced next Monday - will tie the knot at Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel inside the Westgate Hotel on Thursday, April 23. Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas . Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home. Couples wanting to be the first  to  wed at the Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel must submit a video or photos along with an explanation detailing why they deserve the prize.

But that is exactly what happened when\u00a0Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s 18th-century work Young Woman was replaced by a hand-painted replica, produced in China and ordered over the internet for \u00a370. It has hung in among 270 Old Master paintings since February 10 after a challenge was laid down to the public to 'spot the fake'. Now, three months on, the gallery has revealed that only 10 per cent of the 3,000 people who visited during the experiment guessed correctly. Scroll down for video . Can you spot the difference? A member of the public compares the original painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard (left) and the replica ordered on the internet from China (right) at the Dulwich picture gallery . But the gallery's chief curator, Xavier Bray, said that he was impressed a number of people had managed to spot the imposter hidden among the\u00a0Rembrandts, Rubens and Murillos. He told MailOnline: 'It was a fascinating experiment which gave us a chance to test art connoisseurs and we saw visitor numbers quadruple because of it. 'It made people look closely at a painting and discern what might be a replica and why. Ten per cent got it right, which means Britain as a nation is still a nation of connoisseurs, which is great. 'Unfortunately others got it wrong. A number of visitors presumed the imposter was a female portrait by Rubens, which had been restored 10 years ago, because it appeared brighter. But that was interesting as it allowed us to find out more about the way the public look at our paintings.' The idea for the exhibition, titled Made in China, came from American artist Doug Fishbone. Its aim was to make people think about the way they look at, appreciate and value artistic masterpieces. Mr Bray said Dulwich was keen to challenge the public to 'spot the fake' as a way of engaging with visitors and making the picture gallery more interactive. Visitors were challenged to spot the replica among 270 Old Master paintings. Only 10 per cent of them guessed right. The original and fake are now hanging together, making the difference more obvious . 'Fascinating experiment': The gallery's chief curator, Xavier Bray (pictured), said\u00a0visitor numbers quadrupled after the 'spot the fake' challenge was laid down to the public at the beginning of February . The power of the museum: Mr Bray said the gallery was not planning any similar experiments. Instead, his attention has turned to whether the fake will now become a work of art in its own right . 'It was a risk, no doubt about it,' he said. 'You wouldn't expect the National Gallery or the Tate to display a replica on their walls but because we're an independent charity and don't rely on public money it means we're relatively free to do what we want. 'But that doesn't mean there couldn't have been repercussions. We are a temple of art and as soon as people cross that threshold they expect everything you are told on a label to be correct. 'Our aim was to get people to engage and learn - that is what was really exciting. Can they spot a replica by comparing it with the magical, beautiful originals we have?' The way to distinguish the real from the fake, Mr Bray said, was to look at the lack of warmth in the background canvas of the imposter and the modern pigment of acrylic paints. 'If you look closely, the brushwork on the fake is trying to be expressive but it comes across as dead because it's an attempt to replicate something else. There's no magic to it like there is with the real one.' The original painting was put back in its frame yesterday and hung beside the replica, allowing people to compare the differences between the two. Mr Bray said the gallery was not planning any similar experiments. Instead, his attention has turned to whether the fake will now become a work of art in its own right. 'It will be very interesting to see what happens when the counterfeit leaves the gallery,' he said. 'Will it achieve significance and become a work of art? 'This is where the power of it being displayed in a temple of a museum could give it extra significance in the art world - that is also part of the experiment.' Original: Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s Young Woman . Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s 18th-century work Young Woman is one of his famous Fantasy Figures, a series of quickly executed studies intended to showcase the artist\u2019s virtuoso handling of oil paint. It was painted in 1769. The unidentified woman is portrayed in Spanish dress, with a lace collar and slashed sleeves suggesting the dramatic costume of the stage. It was Spanish painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599-1660) who inspired the depiction of Spanish dress in 18th-century French art. Once thought to be by French artist Jean-Alexis Grimou (1678-1733) on the strength of his signature, closer examination revealed that this was false. Fragonard's genuine signature, \u2018Frago\u2019, is discernible above, although partially obscured by overpainting. It is believed Fragonard was paying a playful homage to Grimou, a fellow artist who was well known in France at the time, particularly as a copyist . It is thought Fragonard's intent was not to deceive, but rather to excite connoisseurs with amusing visual ambiguity.",

The Answer: Many of us shed a few tears over the recent Sabra hummus recall (even though we are perfectly capable of making our own at home), but that sadness quickly transformed into anxiety when we looked inside our refrigerators and saw the potentially tainted culprit sitting there on the shelf. To assuage any fears, we asked John Swartzberg, M.D., a clinical professor at the University of California at Berkeley, to walk us through the process of determining if our favorite dip was still safe to eat. Related: Amy's Kitchen Recalls More Than 70,000 Cases Of Food Due To Fear Of Listeria Contamination . The first step, according to Swartzberg, is to go to the Food and Drug Administration's website and find the official report for the recalled product you're worried about. Each report will list recalled items with their product codes, which are typically categorized by the Universal Product Code (the number adjacent to the barcode) or the Stock Keeping Unit (a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold). They will also include the recalled products' use-by dates, and the geographical areas affected. \"The recall is not based on the use-by dates, though,\" said Swartzberg. \"If the product is within the use-by date, it should still be recalled. This makes sense, because the product was contaminated prior to purchase and no matter how 'fresh' the product is, it still may be contaminated.\" After cross-checking these details, you should have a strong sense of whether your food product is safe to eat or needs to be trashed right away. But as far as avoiding potential problems before learning such details about a food recall, the consumer is at an automatic disadvantage. Related: 14 Habits Of People With A Healthy Relationship To Food . \"There's nothing the consumer can do prior to learning about the recall,\" said Dr. Swartzberg. \"Discarding or returning the product to the store is all that can be done.\" In the case of this specific hummus recall, while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness, the product's routine sample last month revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Consuming such bacteria can lead to listeriosis, a serious infection, and Dr. Swartzberg recommends that anyone who has consumed a listeria-laden food should let their physician know as soon as possible. \"Listeria survives well at cool temperatures,\" he said. \"Most bacteria and fungi do not -- that's why we refrigerate. Healthy people are at low risk for disease, but it can happen. Those at greatest risk for disease are the elderly, immunocompromised and pregnant.\" To learn more about the best food safety practices, visit UC Berkeley's Wellness website.

It is a painful and embarrassing condition that affects millions of British women. Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth. Complications include an uncomfortable dragging or \u2018full\u2019 feeling, discomfort during sex or stress incontinence. Although up to half of women are thought to suffer to some degree, far fewer seek help, and many who do are offered just one solution: a hysterectomy. While surgical removal of the reproductive organs solves the immediate problem, it also ends fertility, and with three months of recovery needed, it is no quick fix. Now, a leading gynaecologist has claimed thousands of patients may be undergoing the drastic operation needlessly. He is one of a growing number of surgeons who claim not enough women are offered the alternative: a half-hour keyhole procedure that uses an implanted mesh \u2018sling\u2019 made from nylon to lift and hold the womb back in place, providing a permanent solution to a prolapse and preserving fertility. The procedure, called a sacrohysteropexy, is rare, with just 1,072 admissions for the surgery in the past three years. By contrast, there were 145,310 admissions to hospitals in England in the past three years for hysterectomies due to conditions such as fibroids, pelvic pain or cancer, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Surgeon Jonathan Broome, who has performed more than 1,000 sacrohysteropexies in the past 15 years, has called for the option to be made more widely available on the NHS so women of child-bearing age are not forced to choose between quality of life or the chance to have children. \u2018Most women requiring surgery for a prolapse will be referred for a hysterectomy by their GP,\u2019 says Mr Broome, who performs the \u00a34,000 procedure for both NHS and private patients at hospitals in Lancashire and Greater Manchester. \u2018That means some women are faced with the dilemma of living a normal life without a prolapse, or the possibility of having children. 'Far too many GPs recommend hysterectomies as the solution to a prolapse, when a sacrohysteropexy is a much better alternative. It\u2019s a shorter operation, with shorter recovery time because it is less invasive, and fertility is not put at risk.\u2019 Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth (file image) Common causes of prolapse include childbirth, lower levels of oestrogen at menopause, being overweight and chronic illnesses such as lung diseases, which create pressure inside the abdomen from coughing. Half of women over 50 will have symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and more than one in ten will have had surgery for the problem by the age of 80. Concerns have been raised about the use of mesh implants in gynaecological procedures, with some women in Scotland and the US complaining of problems including bleeding and infections. But consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones says the risk of complications where mesh is inserted abdominally is very small. Medical watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has received two reports of adverse incidents relating to a sacrohysteropexy since 2011. \u25cfA sacrohysteropexy is keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic to put the womb back into its normal position. \u25cfTiny cuts are made in the stomach through which a telescope and instruments are passed. \u25cfA piece of mesh is inserted via an incision along the bikini line. Using tiny needles, one end of the mesh is attached to the back of the cervix and the other to the coccyx, and it is fixed with metal staples. The mesh is also covered with a thin layer of tissue to prevent scar tissue forming, encouraging the tissue to grow and make the repair stronger. \u25cfIt can stay in place indefinitely and does not require a repeat operation. \u25cfThe procedure takes half an hour and involves an overnight stay in hospital. Mr Spence-Jones agrees that too many women are given the wrong advice on what surgery is right for them. \u2018There seems to be a notion in general practice that taking everything \u2013 in other words, a hysterectomy \u2013 is the answer to a prolapse, when that isn\u2019t the case,\u2019 he says. \u2018Sparing the fertility is a reason for considering procedures other than a hysterectomy, but not the only one.\u2019 One woman who says her life has been transformed by a sacrohysteropexy is 44-year-old mother- of-two Karen Bane, from Lancashire. She suffered feelings of bloatedness following the birth of her daughters Gabrielle, seven, and Jessica, five. \u2018I felt sluggish \u2013 I had back pain, sitting was uncomfortable and intercourse was painful. I\u2019d also started to have leakage. It was mortifying being a woman in my early 40s and not being able to control my bladder. \u2018I put up with the symptoms for five years, but when I started to have bleeding, I knew enough was enough. I was a mother of two young children, yet all I could see were years of misery in front of me.\u2019 Karen went to her GP with her symptoms in May 2014 and was referred to Mr Broome.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nTokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this \"Abenesia\" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history.  He did express \"eternal condolences\" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, \"Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit.\" That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, \"Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard.\" Essentially outsourcing \"apology and war responsibility\" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely \"upholding\" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned \"mistaken national policy,\" \"self-righteous nationalism,\" \"colonial rule\" and \"aggression,\" but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called \"masochistic\" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, \"History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone.\" Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: \"Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses.\" This cavalier \"sh*t happens\" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an \"alliance of hope.\" That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.

The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs . Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ . While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as\u00a0North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem .",

Nina Anderson searched pawn shops near her house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces worth nearly \u00a3400 were taken from her bedroom as she watched television. The great-grandmother, who lives with husband Maurice, 75, eventually spotted two of the stolen items in the window of a Cash and Cheque Express in the city centre two months after the raid. Her actions, which echo those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, led to the arrest of burglar Martin Campbell, who has now been jailed for three years. Detective: Nina Anderson, pictured with husband Maurice, 75, searched pawn shops near their house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces  were taken from her bedroom as she watched TV . Real-life Miss Marple: Mrs Anderson's (left with her husband) actions mirror those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, who was played on ITV by actress Geraldine McEwan (right) between 2004 and 2007 . Portsmouth Crown Court heard Campbell, who had been hired to do odd jobs for the couple, forced his way into the  house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone on December 28. He was arrested by police when Mrs Anderson noticed necklaces missing from her jewellery box, but was later released with no further action. Determined to retrieve her stolen jewellery, Mrs Anderson began looking in nearby pawn shops. She spotted \u00a0two of the missing necklaces in the window of a branch of Cash and Cheque Express on February 19. The pawn shop was able to provide a bank statement, photo ID and ownership declaration that Campbell, 28, had provided when he sold the jewellery. Mrs Anderson contacted the police, who used the records to re-arrest Campbell. Mrs Anderson's actions mirror those of  Miss Marple, a fictional character who appears in 12 of Agatha Christie's novels, solving difficult crimes with her shrewd intelligence. Breaking in: Campbell forced his way into the house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone. Above, the damage done to the door during the raid . She said: 'I left copies of the stolen gold in pawn shops around the city. 'I found myself looking in the windows every time I passed by. Then this time something caught my eye - it was my silver necklace. 'It took my work to do it, otherwise we wouldn't have heard anything.' Prosecutor Martyn Booth told Portsmouth Crown Court: 'The police had effectively concluded their investigations. Thankfully the Andersons had conducted their own enquiries. 'Enquiries established that the defendant had turned up on December 30 two days after the burglary trying to sell the items.' An 18ct gold necklace with an image of St Anthony that Mrs Anderson's late father gave to her when she left Italy in 1957 is still missing. Mrs Anderson said she had treated Campbell like 'one of the family' when she hired him as a handyman and that the burglary was a 'great betrayal'. She said: 'We can't trust anybody, I'm locking myself in. I've been through quite a lot, I've been traumatised. I've had to go to the doctors to get sleeping tablets.' Barry McElduff, defending, handed a letter to the judge written by Campbell apologising to the Andersons. Mr McElduff said: 'He accepts full responsibility for he offences. He expresses remorse and shame. Temptation got the better of him.' The father-of-one has had 24 court appearances for 40 offences, including previous burglaries in 2002, 2003 and 2006. He admitted burglary and fraud relating to pawning the jewellery. He was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison in addition to a suspended sentence for stealing a bicycle that he was serving when he committed the crime. Link: Cristos Charalambides, franchisee of the Cash and Cheque Express where the jewellery was found, with Nina and Maurice Anderson. The pawn shop was able to provide records that traced back to Campbell . Sentencing Campbell to three years, Judge Sarah Munro QC said: 'You describe them as people with hearts of gold. 'You threw their kindness back in their faces as you did their trust in you by breaking into their home and stealing jewellery. These offences, as I hope you understand, were a great betrayal. 'They've led to a considerable detrimental effect on that couple.' The officer investigating the burglary has praised the Andersons for their detective work. He said: 'It was her integrity which led to the recovery of two items. We always encourage victims of crime to check out the normal joints, second hand shops, pawn shops.'

At Lord\u2019s, MCC flags were lowered, and the Australian government offered a state funeral for the man who never lost a Test series as his country\u2019s captain, then became a commentator. David Cameron said he had \u2018grown up listening to Richie Benaud\u2019s wonderful cricket commentary\u2019, while his Australian counterpart Tony Abbott called it \u2018a sad day for Australia\u2019. Retiring as a player in 1964, Benaud\u2019s masterful analysis was universally revered. Here, we reproduce a tribute paid by the Mail\u2019s brilliant sports columnist IAN WOOLDRIDGE \u2014 which he wrote in 2005 after coverage of live international cricket in England switched from terrestrial to satellite TV, depriving cricket fans of Benaud\u2019s voice . . . Richie Benaud in the commentary box at the Oval for the final test of the 2005 Ashes. Thereafter international cricket fans in England lost his genius when live game switched from terrestrial to satellite TV . So it is farewell, then, to the Master of Measured Words. Richie Benaud will not be returning to England next summer to sustain his pre-eminence as cricket\u2019s finest commentator. That is not merely my judgment. A recent poll by The Wisden Cricketer magazine attracted an astonishing 12,000 votes. Precisely 10,128 of them nominated Benaud as the best. Fortunately, he does not leave us without a word or several of advice to those who seek to emulate his success, particularly retired players whose agents deem them instantly equipped to pick up a microphone and irritate us with an effluent of Tower of Babel verbiage. He does so in a valedictory book which is an encyclopaedia of broadcasting wisdom. He names no names. He is too polite for that. Nor is there a hint of the tetchiness that occasionally afflicts icons in their pensionable years. At 74, Benaud is still as fit as a flea, the result of a lifestyle as measured as his commentating. Yes, there are rare occasions when he will let down his hair with the rest of us, but when serious business is afoot he will rise from an increasingly raucous dinner party, check his watch that it is exactly 10pm and announce: \u2018Thank you very much. We\u2019re off.\u2019 At sunrise next morning, he and Daphne, his elegant and unfailingly supportive English wife, will be striding out on their three-mile constitutional. Benaud representing Australia in 1961. He led his country as captain in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series . He is meticulous in all things. On TV commentary days, even Daphne is not allowed to iron his shirts. He presses them himself. He is a food faddist, preparing his Test match lunch boxes at home to be certain of what he is eating. Once, he took a week-long course in Italy to learn how to cook pasta to perfection. His desks at his homes in London, South of France and Sydney are polished plateaux of precision, his reference-book shelves indexed for instant reach. It is this unrelenting self-discipline, instilled by a schoolmaster and great club cricketer father and a lovely mother \u2014 there is a gorgeous picture of her celebrating her 100th birthday with Richie and his Test cricketer brother John in the book \u2014 that launched him into his dual career life. The first, of course, was in cricket, where to haul oneself from school, to club, to State, the Australian team and then its captaincy was a classic climb. Benaud led his country in 28 of his 63 Tests and never lost a series. Such was his cunning as a wrist-spinner that his batsmanship was often overlooked. In fact, he became the first, in an era when far fewer Tests were played, to scale the double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs. But what next? All of seven years before he retired from cricket, Benaud wondered if there could be a distant future in the communication industry. There was little doubt about that since he had been a young crime reporter on a Sydney newspaper, where sub-editors ruthlessly deleted from his copy any flowery phrases which he thought rather good but were irrelevant to the story. It was an important lesson. Then a curious opportunity, which couldn\u2019t happen in today\u2019s schedules, presented itself. At the end of Australia\u2019s 1956 tour to England, all their players were given three weeks off to enjoy such fleshpots of relaxation as they could discover in the British Isles. Australian captain Richie Benaud takes on the MCC in the first innings at Brisbane on December 5, 1958 . Benaud proceeded otherwise. At his own expense he moved from the Kensington Palace Hotel into a cramped lower ground room in the RAC club in Pall Mall and took a BBC television training course, alongside directors, commentators, even audiences, to learn how television worked. He trailed Peter O\u2019Sullevan at Newbury and he studied the commentating techniques of Henry Longhurst on golf and Dan Maskell on tennis. All three had their idiosyncrasies, but one thing they had in common. O\u2019Sullevan, voice rising to overdrive at the climax of a horse race, was circumspect about collateral chatter, just as Longhurst and \u2018Oh I say\u2019 Maskell knew the value of golden silence. Indeed, one of Longhurst\u2019s silences was so long that his director asked over the private intercom: \u2018Excuse me, Henry, but are you still alive?\u2019 Benaud now says: \u2018I didn\u2019t know if I had a future in broadcasting. If I hadn\u2019t done that BBC course my life would have been very different, even though I had to wait for seven years for my chance. \u2018The key feature it taught me was the economy of words. Never insult the viewers by telling them what they have seen perfectly clearly themselves. Only add to it if you had something pertinent to say.\u2019 Benaud rings the bell on the pavilion balcony on the second day of the second test between England and Australia at Lord's during the 2009 Ashes . These days if only. Has he ever made a bloomer? Of course, like all of us, he has. On one celebrated occasion, handing over from a Test match for a news update from Moira Stuart, he called her Moira Shearer, the celebrated ballerina who had starred in an acclaimed film. When Moira Stuart handed back he said: \u2018Thanks, Moira, our newsreader wearing Red Shoes.\u2019 Many, who had not heard his initial blunder, wondered what on earth he was on about. \u2018At the time,\u2019 he recalls, \u2018I thought it was a pretty clever remark, but many tuning in at that moment had no idea what it meant. It taught me never to be such a smart-arse again.\u2019 Laconic, economic, massively instructive and with a dry impartial wit about whoever is getting the upper hand in a Test match, I wonder if we shall ever hear his like again on television? Many are called and surprisingly many are given the opportunity behind the microphone. Very few have served the slogging apprenticeship that makes a master cricket commentator.",

On Saturday the spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles (14km) of the surface to take a closer look at the jets that are being ejected from its surface. But during the manoeuvre, Rosetta lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into \u2018safe mode\u2019, causing it to momentarily lose contact with Earth. The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft (illustrated) has survived a hair-raising encounter with comet 67P after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby. Rosetta launched into space in 2004 and entered orbit around 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014 . \u2018Not the best month to choose to go dry\u2026\u2019 Rosetta project scientist Dr Matt Taylor quipped on Twitter, as the team back on Earth sweated over the safety of the spacecraft. The problems arose due to Rosetta\u2019s limited vision owing to the amount of material it was flying through. The spacecraft uses two star trackers to work out where it is in space, in addition to a sun sensor, navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes. Crucially, the star trackers allow Rosetta to know where it is with respect to the sun and Earth, so it can correctly orient its antenna to send and receive signals from ground stations on our planet. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing to orbit and study the comet. From data collected by the two proves, Esa said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. When the star trackers are not working properly, the antenna  drifts, causing communications to be temporarily lost. And during the recent flyby, the spacecraft started to mistake comet debris for stars, causing it to lose sight of Earth. The spacecraft autonomously attempted to readjust itself but struggled due to its close proximity to comet 67P. Esa said that \u2018hundreds of \u201cfalse stars\u201d were registered\u2019 and it took nearly 24 hours before the spacecraft could properly start tracking again. During this dramatic event, the antenna had become mis-aligned with Earth, so that only a very weak radio signal was being received. Once the tracking system was restored, the off-pointing was immediately correct and the operations team on the ground saw a return to full signal strength. Some issues with \u2018false stars\u2019 were still occurring, though, and attempts to eradicate them caused the same problem to occur. This time, the spacecraft but itself into \u2018safe mode\u2019 to preserve its safety, during which it switched off its science instruments to replace them. Esa said it took until Monday to get the spacecraft back into \u2018normal\u2019 status. On whether the problem could cause Rosetta to lose permanent contact with Earth if it happened again, Dr Taylor told MailOnline that they were 'looking at ways to minimise this from happening.' \u2018Plans for the future are being discussed now,\u2019 he added. He also said they had been \u2018flying at a very low relative velocity to the comet to reduce the chance\u2019 of any lasting damage being caused by debris. The spacecraft is now performing a wide sweep around the comet, giving engineers ample time to make sure the problem does not occur again. 'We are looking to examine the best way to mitigate the chance of re-occurrence,' said Dr Taylor. The spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles (400km) of the comet to within 90 miles (140km) by Wednesday next week. The spacecraft uses two star trackers (shown in red) to work out where it is in space, in addition to a sun sensor, navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes. The star trackers allow Rosetta to know where it is with respect to Earth, so it can send and receive signals. The high gain antenna is in the background . Rosetta was tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface (shown in image). It is hoped that continuing studies like this could reveal what the comet's interior is composed of - but engineers will be hoping that this 'false stars' anomaly does not occur again . This diagram shows an example of Rosetta's recent flyby trajectories at Comet 67P.\u00a0The spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles (400km) of the comet to within 90 miles (140km) by Wednesday next week . The purpose of flying in so close is to examine 67P's geysers. These jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. It is getting closer and closer over the next few months, with its point of closest approach taking place in August. As it becomes more active, Rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data. Studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface, and it could also reveal the connection between the comet\u2019s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface. Despite the drama, Esa was still able to release some amazing images recently taken by Rosetta. This stunning scene was created from two Rosetta frames acquired at 12 miles (19.9 km) from the comet centre on 28 March. The scale is about 1.7 m/pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km . The latest images include ones of Earth and Mars which were taken when the probe was attempting \u2018gravity assist manoeuvres\u2019 in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet. Pictured is Mars as seen by Rosetta in 2007 . As the comet gets closer to the sun, scientists will also be hoping to hear from the Philae lander on the surface. The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. Now, as the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae\u2019s batteries and bring it back to life. As the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae\u2019s batteries and bring it back to life. Shown is one of the first images returned by Philae on the surface, showing what appears to be the probe on its side wedged in darkness against a cliff .",

Yelp, founded in 2004 by two former PayPal employees, is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor's offices. However, like many web businesses, Yelp's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site. Kaylie Milliken is the filmmaker behind Billion Dollar Bully, an ongoing documentary focused on Yelp's impact on small businesses. While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied.

Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014 . Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise . 'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says. Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp. 'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he\u2019s complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn\u2019t figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company . Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production.\u00a0The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the\u00a0trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page. 'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on\u00a0CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive. 'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website . Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall . Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page. While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken. 'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads. Prost Production's Kickstarter campaign reached its $60,000 funding goal, and Milliken says she will resume filming in May with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the Sundance Film Festival.",

It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation. 'I want to reinforce the message that you should be abiding by directions, if the train station is closed, you don't climb over onto railway tracks, It is a shame that people have taken it upon themselves to do so on this occasion.'",

The savage animals tumbled down a snowy Iceland mountainside and crashed onto the rocky beach below during the vicious struggle. Wildlife photographer Einar Gudmann caught the violent encounter on camera. He had been sleeping in his warm shelter when he was suddenly woken by howling. A pair of Arctic foxes viciously fight to the death on the snow in a battle to claim a lone Vixen . The amazing scene was captured on camera by wildlife photographer Einar Gudmann, who was woken up by howling . The two foxes fought each other in bitter sub-zero temperatures after one of them had been copulating with a vixen . After emerging into the bitter sub-zero temperatures, he spotted a female and male fox copulating. But the pair weren't alone - a third Arctic fox lurked nearby. Without warning the single fox emerged and began to growl and howl at the pair. Wiggling free, the female ran for the hills while the two male foxes began to fight. Mr Gudmann said: 'The female's partner managed to grab and get a firm bite over the eye and under the jaw of the single one.

'He used this to push the single one into the sea between the rocks. Splashes went bursting into all direction and moments later the single one was completely submerged and wet. 'Heavy and wet it was obvious at this moment that he had lost the fight. Now it was no longer a matter of fighting to kill, it was a matter of survival.

The snow is whipped into the air by strong winds as one of the foxes desperately seeks shelter . One of the male foxes looks directly at Mr Gudmann's camera as it trots through the snow . Meanwhile, the victorious fox shook off the shock of the brief yet aggressive fight and began a search of its female partner which had fled to the snowy mountainside. Mr Gudmann added: 'In the distance a wounded and vanquished arctic fox struggled the last steps up the snow-bank above the beach and started to hobble up the mountain. 'He had been beaten. The cold night would probably be his last one.'",

Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was looking to improve on the Internet-connected device, which was trumpeted as a huge technological leap forward when it was announced in 2012. However, Google stopped selling the first version and shut its pre-launch Explorer program for Google Glass earlier this year, prompting speculation about the demise of the wearable gadget before it became widely available. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There\u2019s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we\u2019re ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets. 'There are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3' of Google Glass, Vian said, according to NDTV. Details about what the new versions will look like have not yet been released. Processor company Intel is expected to create the chip in the device.",

The appalling conditions of a dog training centre where illegal pitbulls covered in scars were forced to wear electric shock collars and train on treadmills has been caught in shocking footage .

Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" Jama said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack . In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

Walcott has made just five starts for Arsenal this season since returning from a serious knee injury after seven months on the sidelines. And with Arsenal pursuing Raheem Sterling and Walcott's contract set to run out next summer, Wright is worried that the Gunners could stand to lose a valuable player. Theo Walcott could be on the way out of Arsenal, and Gunners legend Ian Wright says that would be 'a shame' Wright enjoys Walcott as a player and hinted that he would like to see the winger stay at the club . Walcott started up front for England against Italy on Tuesday but his appearances have been limited this year . 'It's a shame for him, and the fact that people are talking about him maybe moving on if someone else comes in makes me quite sad,' he said. 'I really like him at Arsenal but he's got massive decisions to make in the next few months.' Wright also believes the England wideman, who was played in a central role for his country in Italy on Tuesday night, should have been moved into a similar position for his Arsenal. Walcott's pace had seen him likened to the Gunners' record goalscorer Thierry Henry, who made a similar positional switch during his time in north London, but manager Wenger has only briefly experimented with Walcott as a striker. Thierry Henry was prolific as a striker for Arsenal after being moved inside from his familiar wide role . Arsene Wenger has only briefly used Walcott up front, and Wright says it should have been persisted with . Liverpool's Raheem Sterling is an Arsenal target who also has his contract expiring in the near future . 'I always believed Theo should have been a striker at Arsenal with his pace. I thought playing him on the right would last so long and then he would get moved inside,' Wright told Goal. I'm not saying he's the same kind of player as Thierry Henry by any stretch, but I thought Arsene would move him inside.

Owner Sarah Styler was taking Silver for his morning walk when she spotted TV crews gathered outside the church hall close to her house where Mr Cameron was giving his speech. Along with a group of other passersby Mrs Styler, 49, waited to speak to Mr Cameron. But shortly before he emerged from the building she was told that she would only be allowed to speak to the Prime Minister without her dog present. A Tory aide took the dog from her and walked him over to the other side of the road to what was deemed a safe distance from the Prime Minister. Mr Cameron chatted briefly to the group and commented on how sunny it was before leaving in his car. As Silver was returned to Mrs Styler, the aide told her: 'The Prime Minister loves dogs, but it was just for security.' Mrs Styler, who is the head of polo at Cheltenham College, took the ban on her dog meeting Mr Cameron in good heart. She said: 'It's quite funny that they did not want Silver near the PM, but I guess as an eight-month-old Jack Terrier poodle he is quite a security threat. 'I'm surprised MI5 are not getting involved.' Mr Cameron had spoken to voters after a speech in Cheltenham to outline Tory plans for inheritance tax . Mr Cameron was memorably photographed with huskies during an Arctic visit in 2006 to show off his green credentials when he was opposition leader. In 2013 he faced embarrassment after he was unable to keep hold of a dog on a visit to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.

Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to obesity - which she says leaves her so tired that she falls asleep unexpectedly. The 21-year-old, who put on 13 stone in four years by eating through 'boredom', has not worked for five years because she says she would be a 'danger' in the workplace. Pressure group the Taxpayers' Alliance has now warned that the benefit system should not become a 'comfort blanket' and that people should 'get themselves in shape' to work. Scroll down for video . Morbidly obese Rochelle Coulson (left and right) claims \u00a318,000 in benefits because she suffers from sleep apnoea - a condition often linked to excessive weight - which leaves her so tired that she can't stay awake . Ms Coulson told MailOnline: 'I can't work because of my condition. If I was sat in an office, I would just fall asleep and the manager will end up sacking me. 'It's not just that, but I could make something go wrong, couldn't I? By falling asleep and making a mistake. Who knows what buttons I would press or what would happen? It wouldn't be fair on my colleagues.' Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she needs a state-funded support worker to write her meal plans. Instead, she continues to claim \u00a318,712 a year in benefits - the equivalent of a \u00a322,000 taxable salary - which is more than a nurse's starting wage and the same pay as a newly-qualified teacher. She added: 'I would love to have a job, I didn't chose to be like this. But I can't. I'm too dangerous. I can't do anything if I'm falling asleep the whole time.' Ms Coulson, who lives alone in New Milton, Hampshire, said she has always battled with her weight. However, her weight spiralled out of control after she left home four years ago. Unable to get a job due to being signed off with depression, the young woman started eating up to ten packs of crisps per day because she was 'bored'. She would also have an evening takeaway - and had soon put on 13 stone. Ms Coulson, pictured with her mother Lynda, 50, says she would like to work if she were able to do so . Doctors have now warned Ms Coulson that she needs to lose weight to cure her condition - but she says she can only do that with a state-funded support worker to help her write meal plans . She said: 'I developed depression and that just made me eat more. I would have takeaways most nights. I ate a lot, including chocolate and crisps. It was a way of coping.' Sleep apnoea is a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, which interrupts normal breathing and can stop someone getting a decent night's sleep. Ms Coulson, who is 5ft 6in, claims the condition leaves her so tired that she cannot travel to work, incase she drifts off to sleep and misses her bus stop. She also says she is not allowed to drive incase she nods off at the wheel. Rochelle Coulson is entitled to a raft of benefits every month which means she has not had to work for five years. Every month she is entitled to: . Total: \u00a318, 712 . The 21-year-old is supposed to use a Continuous Positive Air Pressure machine (CPAP) to help her sleep during the night. But she decided not to use it because she claims she cannot travel to the doctors for a check-up. She has also been offered\u00a0half-price gym membership by the NHS to help her lose weight - but says she cannot use it because it is too painful to walk. Despite this, Ms Coulson says the NHS could be doing a lot more to help her. She said: 'Yes I do feel there is more out there to help me and the NHS could have done better. 'They haven't done enough to help me tackle my weight. It would be nice to have a check-up each week, or month, when me and the doctor sit down and write a meal plan. Or they could try and get me a support worker. 'I am supposed to have a CPAP machine to help but I do not use it because I can't get back to hospital for a check-up. 'I can't go to hospital because I can't go on public transport as I will fall asleep and my mum can't always be there with me. I can't drive either because of my condition.' Ms Coulson said she started applying for jobs when she first finished college at the age of 18. But she was soon diagnosed with depression and told she was not capable of working. In December 2012, she was then diagnosed with sleep apnoea. Now, she claims she can drop off to sleep unexpectedly for up to six hours per day, meaning she relies on repeat sick notes to claim her state handouts. But in June last year, Ms Coulson was struck off from a GP surgery when her mother Lynda, 50, asked for a three-month note which the doctor refused. When the doctor offered to give her a one-month note instead, the pair were banned for being 'verbally abusive'.\u00a0Ms Coulson then had to be 'interviewed' before being rejected by another surgery. In November, she was finally signed off for five months, after signing up to her third GP. The 21-year-old, who spends her days playing on Facebook, has not had a job for five years because she says she cannot stay awake . This healthy meal of carrots, potatoes, chicken and salad, recently posted by Ms Coulson, is an alternative to her usual takeaways and crisps . In total, Ms Coulson gets \u00a3411 in Personal Independence Payment a month, as well as \u00a3260 Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) a fortnight. Her \u00a3135 a week rent is also covered through housing benefit. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net, and those with genuine conditions must of course be caught by it, but it can never become a comfort blanket and we must ask individuals to get themselves in shape to work. 'Taxpayers cannot afford to support individuals who simply choose not to work, so the authorities must be strict about who is deemed 'fit to work' or not. Ultimately, the benefit system has to encourage people to take responsibility for themselves.' Ms Coulson is now trying to lose weight by swapping her takeaways for healthy alternatives. She hopes that by losing some weight that she will be able to become more active. Nurse starting salary: \u00a321,388. This job requires students to complete a three-year degree at university. Nurses then work a complex shift pattern, including weekends, evenings and nights. Teacher starting salary: \u00a322,023. This requires the person to complete an undergraduate degree - usually three years long - and a one-year PGCE. Alternatively, the trainee teacher can complete an intensive year-long school-centred initial teacher training course on the job (SCITT). Care home worker: Between \u00a314,000 and \u00a318,000. This usually requires someone to complete a diploma in health and social care, as well as to undertake training and courses while on the job. She said: 'At the moment, it's hard for me to do everyday things like getting out of bed. The hardest is getting out of my mum's couch. It hurts my hips to lift myself out, because the sofa is broken due to my weight. 'My back also can't cope with standing for too long because of my weight, which means it very painful to walk.' She added: 'I'm dropping things like crisps and chocolate and replacing it with low fat Greek yoghurt. I used to eat takeaways on a regular basis but now I don't. 'Once I've shifted some, I can hopefully get out a little more.' Ms Coulson also said she had a blood test last week which showed she is borderline diabetic and has an underactive thyroid, for which she is now taking medication. A DWP spokesman said: 'Being obese in itself does not entitle a person to disability benefits, although the associated long-term health effects may. 'Decisions on whether a person is entitled to disability benefits are based on thorough assessments and consideration of any medical evidence, including from their GP.'",

Jamyra Gallmon of Washington was arrested last week and charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 at the boutique Donovan Hotel. According to a police affidavit filed in court on Thursday, she stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card. Her roommate - and alleged girlfriend - 19-year-old Dominique Johnson was arrested on Wednesday and is accused of being an accomplice. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, right, has been charged in the stabbing death of a lawyer at an upscale Washington hotel stole just $40 and the victim's Metro SmarTrip card, while Dominique Johnson, left, has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery . She has been charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery and made an initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday during which she denied the charge against her. According to court documents, Johnson was charged because she knew Gallmon was going to rob Messerschmitt. She also allegedly accompanied Gallmon to CVS to buy the zip ties used to tie the victim up. According to documents, after Gallmon returned from the hotel, she told Johnson that the robbery 'went badly.' When Johnson was arrested on Wednesday, she had two Metro cards, including Messerschmitt's card which had been used on April 1. Gallmon has a court hearing scheduled for Friday, but that has now been rescheduled until May 8. She is being held without bond. The woman has admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale hotel with the intention of robbing him. Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing, told detectives that the robbery went wrong when Messerschmitt grabbed her arm, causing a flashback to a time when she had been assaulted. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . Gallmon was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9 . His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Her attorney asserted in court that it was a case of 'imperfect self-defense.' Court documents concerning a rent dispute confirm Gallmon and Johnson as roomates. About two weeks after Messerschmitt was killed, the two were ordered by a D.C. Superior Court judge to pay $1,860 in rent owed since January. A neighbor of the two women said he was surprised that they could be mixed up in such a crime. 'They were great neighbors. They never made much noise, nothing out of the ordinary. Great people,' Tony Johnson told WUSA9. He said he believed they were also lovers. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . Among the items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. On the left, another view of the security footage of Jamyra Gallmon at the Washington hotel and on the right, Messerschmitt . Emotional: Last month, Messerschmitt's wife, Kim Vuong, held a press conference, asking for help in locating her husband's killer . Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. Authorities have said they are searching for anyone else who may have e-mailed the account used by Gallmon \u2014 chrissanchez0906@yahoo.com \u2014 but have not said whether anyone has come forward. The new court documents do not say whether anyone else beside Messerschmitt was targeted. Last month, Messerchmitt's wife Kim Vuong gave an emotional speech, asking for help in finding her husband's killer. 'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. A Cincinnati native, Messerchmitt attended Ohio State University where he met his wife. He went on to study law at Boston University before working at a firm in Chicago. He then worked at two more firms in the D.C. area before transferring to DLA Piper last year, as a specialist in intellectual property law.",

But one thing is for certain: it definitely took guts. With a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion, it can be revealed that Prince Andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in Calcutta. Rescued from brothels and domestic servitude, child labour and human trafficking, the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called Key to Freedom. Moved: Prince Andrew during his visit to an Indian refuge in 2012, which inspired him to form the charity . Their kimonos, duster coats, pyjamas, scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the British High Street by Topshop, with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary. What makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after Andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with American \u2018sex slave\u2019 Virginia Roberts, who had been working for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire. The claims, furiously denied by the Duke, have now been struck out of American court records, effectively clearing his name. He was inspired to launch Key to Freedom after visiting a girls\u2019 refuge on an official trip to India. He came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation and swiftly donated \u00a310,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, the Duke said: \u2018I was incredibly impressed with the work of the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation during my Diamond Jubilee visit to India in May 2012. \u2018I could see that it would be possible to complement [founder and chairman] Aloka Mitra\u2019s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products. It is incredible to see what the team has achieved. Roberts had been working for Andrew's former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire (pictured together above) \u2018I am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the United Kingdom. \u2018Most importantly, this has helped the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation support more young people to develop skills, which is an important area of focus for my work.\u2019 One of the young women who moved him so deeply was Anita, now 19. She was chosen to show the Duke how to block-print silk when he visited the refuge. In return, he left two copies of Little Red\u2019s Summer Adventure, a book written by his former wife Sarah. The child of two tea garden labourers from northern Bengal, Anita was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends. Lured to New Delhi with the promise of a job to help her support her family, she escaped only to find herself living as a \u2018railway child\u2019 at the city\u2019s station. Illiterate and destitute, she had no way home until she was taken in by the WIF where she met the Duke on his trip. She was among the first girls to sign up to Key to Freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees \u2013 approximately \u00a3430 \u2013 supplying silk goods to Topshop. She has also been reunited with her family near Darjeeling. \u2018We traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted,\u2019 revealed Aloka. \u2018Once we had told them her real story and that she\u2019d learned English and Bengali and maths, and that she had a craft and was earning a living, they changed their mind.\u2019 Anita said: \u2018I am doing well now and so is my mother. She was sick and I have been able to pay for medical treatment for her. \u2018I have earned almost 40,000 rupees through Key to Freedom and I have a skill which will help my future. I hope I keep getting orders for my work. I hope it won\u2019t stop.\u2019 Prince Andrew\u2019s 25-year-old daughter, Princess Eugenie, and his former wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have both paid private visits to help support the charity, and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative. The Duke\u2019s eldest daughter Beatrice, 26, was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months, although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in New York. Eugenie also works in the city for an online auction house. Other workers with Key to Freedom include Taralika, 25, who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home. \u2018She was locked up in a brothel and beaten, and then starved for days for refusing to have sex,\u2019 said Aloka. Profits: About \u00a320,000 from Topshop sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their UK stores . \u2018Finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police. She was, and still remains, mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she\u2019s making excellent progress. She is happy and confident working as a tailor.\u2019 Another Key to Freedom success story is Shila, 21, an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of Calcutta. Aloka said: \u2018She now has a bank account like any other working woman. It has totally changed her life. \u2018Poverty makes these women victims. They suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn. They live with abuse \u2013 mental, physical and sexual \u2013 just to be certain of food and shelter. \u2018The Duke understood that and wanted to make a difference \u2013 as the father of two daughters I think the plight of the girls here resonated with him. \u2018He wanted to given them their independence. Handmade: A silk Topshop kimono . \u2018There was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit. The only thing he asked me was, \u201cWhat do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls?\u201d \u2018I spoke to him about alternative income earning, a regular outlet to sell their work, and skills development to make their craft more marketable. His aides called less than an hour after he\u2019d left and set up a meeting the same night. \u2018He had already spoken to the Duchess of York about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could. The name Key to Freedom was her idea.\u2019 Aloka added: \u2018While I understood that their heart was in the right place, I also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought. \u2018Not only did they find the time, they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today. \u2018It was Prince Andrew\u2019s skills at connecting businesses that linked us to Topshop. It\u2019s nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the UK.\u2019 Aloka came to London for talks with the Duke\u2019s team at Buckingham Palace just three months after their initial meeting, and by summer 2013 Key to Freedom was up and running. It fulfilled its first order to Topshop, every piece individually signed by the woman who made it, in July 2013. Since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold. Yesterday, the High Street giant, which sent designer Penny McIvor to India to assist with colours, patterns and quality control, confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year. Topshop declined to discuss sales figures, but it is understood around \u00a320,000 has so far been paid by the company, which makes no profit from the scheme, to the Prince Andrew Charitable Foundation. This then sends the money back to Key to Freedom in Calcutta. In addition, the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of Prince Andrew\u2019s Pitch@Palace events for entrepreneurs last month, where 200 of its scarves were also on sale. The scheme is another of his business-to-business initiatives uniting start-ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors, venture capitalists and mentors. A Buckingham Palace source said that the Prince remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity \u2013 such as Pitch@Palace \u2013 to promote it. \u2018It\u2019s been completely empowering for the girls here,\u2019 said Aloka. \u2018It\u2019s about honour and dignity, and having control over their own future. \u2018It means they can look ahead and put their past behind them.\u2019",

Their parade was also to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. In the City of London, Morris men brightened up Leadenhall Market, dancing through the shopping arcade to the amusement of workers on their lunch break. Temperatures were slightly warmer across England today than on St George's Day last year, with parts of north Yorkshire the warmest at 20.9C. It comes after a week of abnormally warm weather that is set to end tomorrow, said forecasters. 'There is certainly a change on the way, as of tomorrow we'll see wetter fronts,' said Helen Roberts, a Met Office forecaster. 'The first will be affecting south west England and Wales with some rain pushing in through the afternoon on Friday. 'A cold front will creep across Scotland and will be pretty slow moving. That will reach southern England on Sunday bringing some heavy rain at times.' Two women don face masks to take part in the festivities in Nottingham this morning.

Temperatures will drop from the balmy mid-teens to around 11 or 12C, she added. 'It was much more unsettled this time last year though we saw 18.9C on St George's Day in Gravesend in Kent. 'We have had above average temperatures for some time though this year so the drop will be a bit of a shock to the system.' Some rain storms on Sunday may even bring hail to some parts. Earlier politicians chimed in on why they thought St George's Day was important. 'Above Downing Street and all over England, St George's flags are flying high,' said David Cameron. In Emsworth, Hampshire, members of the 12th Regiment Royal Artillery take part in the annual parade, with red roses pinned to their jackets . Veterans of the 12th Regiment Royal Artillery dusted off their medals to take part in the annual event with their younger comrades today .

'A country whose artists and athletes inspire millions and whose influence extends right across the world. 'So today let us all be proud of our country's great past and confident about our future.' Ukip sparked controversy by claiming George, who is thought to have been of Turkish descent, was accepted into Britain because he could slay dragons. Asked whether a 3rd Century Ukip politician would have welcomed the saint, the party's economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn joked: 'Well, I guess dragon-slaying is a skill but whether it is one that's in short supply for the needs of the British economy, we will leave to our migration commission. 'Whenever the issue of St George's Day comes up - and I can predict this on Twitter today - there will be many left-centre people who will tweet the fact that St George was from what's today known as Turkey as if that is the start, finish of conversation and that makes St George's Day irrelevant or illegitimate or ridiculous. 'I completely disagree ... I'm not particularly hung up on where St George came from. I'm more interested in what St George's Day can represent.'

'Plain and simple, if you f*** with me I'm going to break your leg before you even get a chance to run. Be honest. I don't screw around,' says the officer. Keeping calm, Mohamed's friend replies to the officer without missing a beat to say, 'Who said I was going to run?' Scroll down for video .

With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you\u2019re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don\u2019t do that.'",

But while the scene looks idyllic, it is tinged with sadness, as Joel Wilkinson has a muscle wasting disease meaning he will eventually be left in a wheelchair and his life will be cut short. The three-year-old, from Hull, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just six months ago after his parents, Emma, 33, and Chris, 36, noticed he was struggling to develop and learn to walk. They were left devastated when tests confirmed their son had the incurable condition and that is likely only to live to the age of 20. Now, they have decided to make his short life as full of joy as possible. Joel Wilkinson, five, was diagnosed with\u00a0Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy six months ago, meaning his muscles will slowly waste away. His sister Phoebe, five, adores him and cares for him as much as possible . Joel will eventually need a wheelchair and has a life expectancy of just 20. \u00a0Phoebe  plays only 'muscle friendly' games that won't tire her brother out - and refuses to play games at school unless Joel can join in . Phoebe makes sure her brother is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat (left), fetches his cereal in the morning and plays with him in the garden (right) Thankfully Joel's big sister, Phoebe, five, adores her brother and makes sure he is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat and even helps fetch him his cereals in the morning. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'We were heart broken when we discovered that Joel had such an awful terminal disease. 'We told Phoebe as soon as Joel was diagnosed that he had a problem with his muscles and that they're weaker than normal. 'It was important she understood so they could play games that wouldn't tire him such as playing with toys and painting. 'We've told them both that the doctors are trying to find a medicine to help. 'She now only plays \"muscle friendly\" games that don't involve Joel running around and getting extremely tired. 'Phoebe loves her little brother so much and she even takes care of him when they are both at school as they share break times together. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. It usually only affects boys (around one in 3,500), although girls can carry the defective gene. Although not apparent at birth symptoms appear in early childhood. Boys with Duchenne's will have difficulty with walking, jumping and climbing stairs. The disorder is diagnosed via a blood test and muscle tissue sample. Sufferers are likely to need increasing help and treatments from the age of nine. Walking becomes difficult and a wheelchair is usually needed by the age of 12. As patients go through their teenage years they are more likely to suffer from complications such as chest infections. Most most people with Duchennes survive well into their 20s and sometimes longer. The eventual cause of death is usually a severe chest infection at the stage when lung function is already poor. 'She openly tells their friends that she won't join in with any games unless Joel can keep up too. 'It's such a relief knowing that she's keeping an eye on him when I'm not around.' Mr and Mrs Wilkinson found out their son Joel had Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just before his third birthday last year. The condition affects around one in 3,500 and causes difficulties with movement, meaning a wheelchair is normally needed by the age of 12. Mrs Wilkinson said she hopes there will be a scientific breakthrough before that point. She said: 'His only hope is that researchers have a breakthrough in time to save him and the hundreds of other boys who have this terrible disease. 'Joel will lose the use of his legs first, leaving him wheelchair-bound, and then other muscles thereafter. Eventually, his heart and lungs will fail. At first Joel's parents thought he was a late developer but when at six months he couldn't sit and by two he couldn't walk they knew something was seriously wrong. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Results from the blood test in July said he had muscle dystrophy, but it wasn't until the end of September, after more tests, that we found out it was Duchenne.' The disease, which results in muscle degeneration, has already left Joel unable to get up the stairs or walk long distances. Mrs Wilkinson added: 'Joel struggles to stand up and despite only being three he looks like a little old man when he tries to get up. 'It's an awful illness but we are going to ensure that Joel has the best life and with Phoebe's help we know he'll enjoy every second. 'Phoebe will often clear away both of their toys so that her little brother doesn't get too tired. 'She will help him put on his shoes, fasten his coat and even helps him with his cereals in the morning. 'When I tell them both to tidy up their toys Phoebe will instantly stick up for him and say \"what about his weak muscles\". Emma Wilkinson, 33, and her husband Chris, 36, realised there was something wrong with their son when Joel wasn't developing properly. The family have now decided to make Joel's short life full of joy . As well as playing with her brother at home, Phoebe looks after Joel at school, spending break times with him . 'It's adorable but he's so spoilt.' Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy occurs mainly in boys and although it can be inherited it often occurs with no known family history of the condition. Mrs Wilkinson said this was the case for her and her husband, so they were shocked when Joel was diagnosed. She said: 'We have no family history of the condition so it has been such a shock for us to come to terms with but that's why we've set up the Joy for Joel appeal.' The family have set up at online fundraising website to ensure Joel he gets the specialist treatment he needs to make his life as comfortable as possible. 'We need funds to help Joel be as independent as possible when he grows up and so we can adapt our home,' Mrs Wilkinson explained. 'When he's older we will need a special hoist and a bedroom and wet room downstairs.' Until then, the family are focusing on creating as many memories as possible with Joel while he has some muscle function. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Thanks to Phoebe, Joel has a constant play mate and she helps him ensure he gets the most out of the time he has being able to move his muscles. 'There isn't any medication Joel can take that will slow down his muscle deterioration so we have to watch helplessly as he slowly becomes weaker. 'But we're trying to keep positive and with the help of Phoebe we are getting through it as a family.' There is no cure for Duchenne's, nor any medication that can slow \u00a0his muscle deterioration. But thanks to Phoebe, Joel  has a constant playmate . Often Phoebe will clear up Joel's toys after they have played together so he doesn't become to fatigued.\u00a0'It's adorable but he's so spoilt,' Mrs Wilkinson said . Mr Wilkinson, who works in IT development support at a logistics company, said: 'We cannot put into words the heartache and devastation Joel's diagnosis is causing us. 'Being unable to help, mend and protect your child is soul-destroying. 'The only thing we can do is bring joy to the time he has.' Families in a similar position can find support by contacting Muscular Dystrophy UK. Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the charity, said: 'Hearing that your child has a rare muscle-wasting condition can be a huge shock for parents. 'Families time and time again tell us about the importance of having a strong network in place. 'For many parents, family members and charities like Muscular Dystrophy UK, can play a major role in providing that much needed emotional support and practical help, throughout this journey. 'Many families have told us how they are struck by the sense of acceptance and resilience that a sibling can display as their brother or sister gradually gets weaker. 'Siblings can be very protective and supportive of each other, and will often find imaginative ways to play and have fun together despite mobility issues. 'This can be a huge source of comfort and reassurance for parents.' To donate visit: http://www.joyforjoel.co.uk .",

The body of Charmain Adusah, 41, was discovered by hotel staff face down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days. Her husband, Eric Isaiah Adusah, a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher, was alleged to have left the hotel hurriedly on the day she is believed to have died. Whirlwind romance: Charmain and Eric Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during stay, according to local reports . He told hotel managers at the time that his three-month pregnant wife was ill and did not want to be disturbed. A close family friend claimed last night that Mr Adusah, 28, flew back to London but later returned to Ghana after his wife\u2019s body was found by concerned hotel staff who used a spare key to check on her after she failed to answer the door. Mr Adusah, originally from Ghana, is being held in police custody in the African country on suspicion of murdering the former NHS radiography assistant, whom he married suddenly last September \u2013 following a whirlwind romance \u2013 in a wedding which shocked her family and friends. His wife, whose maiden name was Speirs, already had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship in Wales. Christmas wishes: The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010 . But the boy has not yet been told the awful news and was staying with his father, a British man, last night. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. He has led sermons he describes as \u2018divine visitation\u2019 events across the UK and Ireland, receiving \u00a31million in charitable donations in five years and giving sermons on religious satellite television channels. A close family friend last night accused Mr Adusah of being a \u2018wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u2019, telling The Mail on Sunday: \u2018We think he brainwashed her.\u2019 Mrs Adusah \u2013 who was considered the \u2018First Lady\u2019 of her husband\u2019s ministry \u2013 grew up in Arbroath in Scotland, and studied a degree in photojournalism at Swansea University. She worked as a radiography assistant in the Welsh NHS and later separated from the father of her son. She was described as a \u2018free spirit\u2019 who started following Mr Adusah\u2019s church around two years ago. They started a relationship early last year and married in September in London. The couple had travelled to Ghana early this month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious conference hosted by controversial evangelist \u2018Bishop\u2019 John Yaw Adu, who has been exposed for chaining up mentally ill patients at \u2018prayer camps\u2019 for days on end so he could \u2018heal\u2019 them through prayer. Local reports claim Mr Adusah and his wife had argued at the start of the trip and he had booked himself into a budget motel alone, leaving her to stay with Bishop Yaw Adu. Happier times:\u00a0The body of Charmain Adusah, left, was discovered by hotel staff face down in a bath. Husband\u00a0Eric Isaiah Adusah is being held on suspicion of her murder . Arrest:\u00a0Eric Isaiah Adusah, a Ghanaian British based Pastor, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his pregnant British wife Charmain Spears . After the conference ended, the couple apparently reconciled and checked into the Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua, where they booked in for five days on March 16. The upmarket hotel has security gates and tropical gardens. The couple were said to have argued over the length of their stay, according to the reports, with Mrs Adusah apparently wanting to stay in Ghana for a month but her husband saying it was far too long. Mr Adusah is said to have left the hotel at dawn the next day and warned reception that his wife did not want to be disturbed. But hotel managers became concerned when she still had not left the room and would not respond to knocks on the door. On March 20 hotel porters used a spare key to gain access to the room. A spokesman for Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at the police headquarters in Koforidua said Mrs Adusah was \u2018found dead in the bath lying prostrate with a white towel wrapped around her, almost in a decomposed state\u2019. Her close friend Christine Stephen, 42, of Camberley, Surrey, who has known Mrs Adusah since childhood, told The Mail on Sunday that the family did not hear about her death until March 21. She said: \u2018I spoke to Charmain\u2019s family and they said Eric had been in touch on that Saturday to say she had died. He said he was flying back to Ghana to identify her body on Sunday. Tragic: Charmain Adusah was found face down in a bath by hotel staff in Ghana . The Global Light Revival Ministries, founded by Eric Adusah in 2010, is a revivalist evangelical movement registered as a British charity and has received more than \u00a31m in donations. It hosts gatherings across the UK and Ireland . He also told them he had returned to England because he had a three-day church event he had to attend here. But he was vague about the details of what happened, saying she had wanted to remain out there to help underprivileged children. \u2018Charmain\u2019s family couldn\u2019t get hold of him after that Saturday, presumably because he had been arrested back in Ghana.\u2019 Mrs Stephen said none of her friends took to him. \u2018We thought he tried to cut her off from us, that he had brain-washed her. What person declares himself a prophet? Charmain was religious but she wasn\u2019t a pastor.\u2019 Mrs Stephen said the family wants to go to Ghana and repatriate their daughter\u2019s body but they cannot afford it. Charmain\u2019s mother Linda Speirs, 61, last night said she had been given legal advice not to comment. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u2018We confirm the death of a British national in Ghana. Mr Adusah has not requested consular assistance.\u2019 A representative of Mr Adusah\u2019s church said: \u2018There is no story. She died of natural causes.\u2019 Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has made the headlines throughout his trophy-laden career but it appears a novel way has been created to find any information purely about the maverick 32-year-old striker. Search engine zlaaatan.com has immortalised the Paris Saint-Germain forward with the site totally devoted to the French giants' No 10. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had a search engine website created in his honour called\u00a0zlaaatan.com . The website has an identical  style to Google with users given the option\u00a0to 'Zlatan Search' or 'I'm feeling Zlatan' In a house style that is identical to Google, and operates just like the search engine, users have the option to 'Zlatan Search' or 'I'm feeling Zlatan.' The click of the former button takes users to articles about Ibrahimovic on Google, while the latter directs them to his Wikipedia page. In addition any results from the search bar will automatically add 'Zlatan' to the front - meaning he will forever be at the forefront of the news. It must be said though that website is neither affiliated with Ibrahimovic nor Google. The website though has no affliation with the Paris Saint-Germain No 10 (left) nor Google . Creative director of  SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, Andreas Killander hopes the search engine will bring a smile to the Sweden international. 'We didn't ask his permission, but we hope he sees it as an amusing experience,' he said. 'Our search engine is linked to Google but all the searches are Zlatanified. All the results have some link to Zlatan... if you type in Ferrari, you'll get stuff about Zlatan's Ferrari; if you want a recipe, you'll get the Zlatan Burger. 'Zlatan is an idol. He's known the world over. That's why we chose him.' SweetPop, the agency that came up with the website idea, hope that Ibrahimovic (left) will find it amusing . As memorable as he can be with his feet, Zlatan Ibrahimovic can also do likewise with his tongue. Sportsmail reminds you of 10 of the Sweden international's best quotes. 'In my head I am the strongest of all. I certainly don't need the Ballon d'Or to prove that I am number one.' Ibrahimovic may not have been named on the shortlist for the 2012 Ballon d'Or award, but it clearly didn't affect the striker's confidence in his own ability. 'A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup.' Ibrahimovic came up against Cristiano Ronaldo in the play-off to reach the World Cup in Brazil last summer, but it was Sweden that were on the losing side and the PSG forward let everyone know there wasn't much point in watching a tournament that didn't feature himself. 'I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was like \"No way, Zlatan doesn\u2019t do auditions\".' Arsene Wenger revealed that he came close to signing Ibrahimovic when he was a fresh-faced 16-year-old but he refused to have a trial at the north London club. 'Nothing. She already has Zlatan.' As any man will attest to, buying a gift for your loved one can be a difficult task. Not for Ibrahimovic though, who admits his wife needs nothing else for her birthday when she already has Zlatan. 'Well, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask your wife about that.' As a member of the media you have to remember to choose your questions carefully when interviewing Ibrahimovic. This reporter wasn't, and asked the striker how he got the scars on his face. 'What Carew does with a football, I can do with an orange.' Ibrahimovic didn't take too kindly to criticism from Scandinavian counterpart and former Aston Villa and West Ham striker John Carew. 'Come to my house and you'll see if I'm gay, and bring your sister.' During his spell at Barcelona a picture emerged of Ibrahimovic getting rather close to team-mate Gerard Pique but the Sweden international strongly refuted suggestions he was gay, particularly when they were voiced by one female reporter. 'It was the fault of David Trezeguet, who made me do one drink of vodka after another. I slept in the bathtub. Now I hold my vodka much better.' Ibrahimovic tried to pass the blame to former Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet after reports of excessive behaviour following the club's Serie A title success. 'I like fireworks too, but I set them off in gardens or kebab stands. I never set fire to my own house.' After Mario Balotelli, a former team-mate of Ibrahimovic's at Inter Milan, set fire to his bathroom when he let fireworks of out the window, the PSG hitman admitted his like for fireworks. 'You bought a Ferrari but you drive it like a Fiat.' Ibrahimovic's short and tumultuous stint in La Liga with Barcelona was riddled with arguments and falling outs, particularly with manager Pep Guardiola and the 33-year-old was not happy with his role in the team.",

Federici allowed Alexis Sanchez's driven shot to slip through his body in extra-time as Arsenal ran out 2-1 winners at Wembley to reach their second consecutive final, having beaten Hull to lift the trophy last year. The mistake overshadowed a number of strong saves Federici had made to keep his side in the game and Szczesny had only kind words for his opposite number. Wojciech Szczesny (left) says he feels sorry for Adam Federici after his mistake in the FA Cup semi-final . 'He can be very proud. It only went to extra-time because the goalkeeper was magnificent,' Szczesny told Arsenal's official website. 'We're very happy to go through but personally I do feel for the goalkeeper. 'It's a difficult moment for him. He was the best player on the pitch and in his dreams last night he was probably hoping he would get them through to the final. 'He did everything to do so but got very unlucky in extra-time. The Australian let an Alexis Sanchez effort slip through his hands and sneak over the line in extra-time . 'It was a really good performance from him and he's shown what a good keeper he is.' Arsenal looked like they might enjoy a comfortable afternoon when Sanchez opened the scoring in the first half, but Garath McCleary's equaliser galvanised the Championship outfit. 'You know what to expect when you play Championship sides,' Szczesny said. Federici was inconsolable at the final whistle despite his team-mates and staff trying to help . 'They're very solid defensively, they're not scared to put their foot or head in and they defend very well. 'Today they did that with a great performance by their goalkeeper. It was a difficult game but we just got over the line.' Arsenal are now just one win away from defending the crown they secured last year, with either Liverpool or Aston Villa lying in wait in the final. Szczesny was also at fault for the Reading goal when he let Gareth McCleary's shot find a way into the net . Victory would also see the Gunners become the most successful FA Cup team of all time as they currently sit level on 11 titles with Manchester United. 'We want to win for the fans,' Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla added. 'It's always special to play at Wembley and we have a good opportunity to get the title. 'Now we have to wait for the other team - Liverpool or Aston Villa.'",

George, currently 102, proposed on Valentine's Day and will marry for the third time on June 13 - getting hitched to Doreen in front of 60 guests . 'I didn't get down on one knee, because I don't think I would have been able to get back up.' Between them they have had seven children, 15 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. They finally decided to make the union official by giving into pressure from their elderly children. George, currently 102, proposed on Valentine's Day and will marry for the third time on June 13 - getting hitched to Doreen in front of 60 guests. Doreen said: 'I won't be much of a blushing bride, but I'm getting a bit giddy thinking about it.'

The pair, started courting in the 1988, when they met through an organisation to find friends for mature people. George, then 76, had just got divorced while Doreen, who lived in Staplehurst, Kent, had sadly become a widow three years earlier following 36 years of marriage. She said: 'He used to come to my house. We got on straight away. He liked the roses in my front garden.'

The couple quickly became an item and set up home together in 1990, but George only proposed to her on this February 14. George said: 'We were having dinner and I asked Doreen if she wanted to be married to me for a short time. I was so happy that she said yes.' The pair will get married at the Langham Hotel, owned by George's son Neil, where they have lived since 2013. Neil, 63, who will be best man, said: 'We've adopted Doreen as our mum and we're delighted that she's going to become a Kirby.

Doreen was born in Brixton in September 1923 and spent much of her career as a shorthand typist for the Director of Public Prosecutions at Temple, where she worked on transcripts for the cases of the Kray twins and Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. Sprightly Doreen keeps herself in shape by doing yoga classes on the seafront every week. Instead of wedding presents, the pair would like to raise as much money as they can for their chosen charities - the Royal Air Forces Association and the Women's Royal Naval Service .

Lucian Faggiano bought the building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy and had planned to turn it into a trattoria - but renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked. And while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a Messapian tomb built 2,000 years ago, a Roman granary, a Franciscan chapel, and even etchings thought to be made by the Knights Templar. Scroll down for 3D tour . Lucian Faggiano's dream of opening a restaurant was scuppered when a dig to find a blocked sewage point yielded some 2,000 years of hidden history, including vast rooms and pottery (shown in this image that features Mr Faggiano left and his son) In a bid to stop the sewage backing up, Mr Faggiano, 60, and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 Via Ascanio Grandi,The New York Times reported. The search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium. Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and an important trading post for the Romans. But the first layers of the city date to the time of Homer, according to local historian Mario De Marco. Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the building has been turned into Museum Faggiano (pictured) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family . He imagined it would take a week to dig down and fix the plumbing beneath the building, but instead, the DIY mission led to the discovery of a Messapian tomb, a Roman granary (pictured left), a Franciscan chapel - and even etchings from the Knights Templar. An ancient room beneath the modern building is shown right . The search for the pipe (shown in this image of Mr Faggiano and his son) began at the turn of the millennium when no-one could have predicted the treasures hidden beneath the floorboards, which revealed a subterranean world dating back to before the birth of Jesus . It is not unusual for religious relics to turn up in fields or in the middle of the city itself, which has a mixture of old architecture . For example, a century ago, a Roman amphitheatre was recently found beneath a marble column bearing the statue of Lecce\u2019s patron saint, Orontius in the main square and recently a Roman temple was found under a car park. \u2018Whenever you dig a hole, centuries of history come out,\u2019 said Severo Martini, a member of the City Council. Years of excavations have seen the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Here, Mr Faggiano carries a piece of Roman pottery from an underground room . The building yielded plenty of nooks and crannies including mysterious shafts (pictured left and right) which lead to older parts of the building deeper and deeper underground . Lucian Faggiano bought the seemingly standard building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy, (marked on this map) but his dream of turning it into a trattoria was put on hold thanks to a broken toilet.\u00a0Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and a trading post for the Romans . The origins of Lecce in southern Italy are thought to be more than 2,000 years old. It was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, explaining the city's Greek culture. According to legend, a city called Sybar existed at the time of the Trojan War and was founded by the Messapii. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, who gave it the name Lupiae, which later became Lecce. Under the emperor Hadrian, in the second century AD, the city moved two miles (3km) northeast, got a theatre and an amphitheatre and was connected to the Hadrian Port. Oronotius of Lecce, who is known as Sant'Oronzo is thought to have served as the city's first Christian bishop and is now Lecce's patron saint. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was sacked by king Totila in the Gothic Wars. After that it was conquered once again by the Byzantines in 549 and remained part of the Eastern Empire despite some small conquests. After the Normans arrived in the 11th century, Lecce grew in commercial importance again, having been an important trading post in Roman times. It grew rich and became one of the most important cities in southern Italy, evidenced by its many impressive Baroque monuments. Plague broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to Allied fighters fighting the Nazis in the Second World War. Mr Faggiano asked his sons to help fix the problem with the plumbing so he could accelerate the opening of his restaurant, in a building that looked like it was modernised. But when they dug down they hit a floor of medieval stone, beneath which was a Messapian tomb, built by people who lived in the area before the birth of Jesus. Legend has it the city was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, but then the settlement was called Sybar. Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain, and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife, in part perhaps because he was lowering his youngest son, Davide, 12 though small gaps in the floor to aid his work. But his wife, Anna Maria San\u00f2 suspected the work was more complex than it appeared thanks to the amount of dirty clothes she was washing, and because of dirt and debris being taken away. Investigators shut down the site, warning Mr Faggiano he was conducting an unofficial archaeological dig. After a year, work continued but had to be overseen by heritage officials who witnessed the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Retired cultural heritage official, Giovanni Giangreco, who was involved with the excavation, said: \u2018The Faggiano house has layers that are representative of almost all of the city\u2019s history, from the Messapians to the Romans, from the medieval to the Byzantine time.\u2019 Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife. Here, he sorts though pieces of glass and pottery found in one of the rooms. There are even pieces embedded in the wall . Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. The cavernous property has been turned into a museum so visitors can easily see the remains (pictured) Mr Faggiano (pictured here with his son in an ancient underground room) admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant . Despite bearing the financial load of the dig, the family became fascinated about the history beneath their building and made ends meet by renting rooms in it. Mr Faggiano admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant. He said: \u2018At one point, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened.\u2019 Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the incredible building has been turned into Museum Faggiano and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers. However, Mr Faggiano hasn\u2019t given up on his culinary dream and is planning on opening a restaurant at a less complex location \u2013 even though he finally found the troublesome sewage pipe.

Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome.

Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead.

Doerr's novel had received rave reviews upon its release last spring. \"I must blame Anthony Doerr for lost sleep, because once I started reading his new novel, 'All the Light We Cannot See,' there was no putting it down,\" wrote William T. Vollmann in The New York Times Book Review. Doerr's work was also a finalist for the National Book Award. It's his second novel and fourth work of fiction, including two short story collections. 2015 Pulitzer Prize winners in journalism named . \"Between Riverside and Crazy,\" a play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, won the Pulitzer for drama. An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf***** with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off -- except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think. She has a good grip on her subject and uses a light touch when it is most needed.\" Other winners in arts and letters categories include \"Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People\" by Elizabeth A. Fenn (history); \"The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe\" by David I. Kertzer (biography/autobiography); \"Anthracite Fields\" by Julia Wolfe (music); and \"Digest\" by Gregory Pardlo (poetry).

Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world No 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene\u2019s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Aljaz Bedene is pictured at his British citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday morning . Andy Murray says British players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking . Bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in Hatfield . Last year, when Bedene stated he intended to try to make the switch, the then British No 3 Dan Evans expressed some doubts about its legitimacy, wondering why he would wish to do it. But Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. \u2018If he was 500 in the world they wouldn\u2019t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit,\u2019 said the 27-year-old Scot. \u2018And he\u2019s obviously the British No 2, comfortably. \u2018So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He\u2019s British now so they\u2019ve just got to deal with it. \u2018I would hope that all the guys who are below him now, like James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup ties then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. \u2018He\u2019s a good player but so are James and Kyle, and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he\u2019s on the tour every week, the other guys aren\u2019t quite there yet.\u2019 Murray admits Bedene's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week . James Ward (left) and Kyle Edmund should try to use Bedene as motivation to get better as a player . Bedene (right) with girlfriend Kimalie, who is a pop singer in her native land of Slovenia . For the first time, Murray, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene: \u2018He\u2019s a good player with a very good serve. He\u2019s a legitimate top-100 player, when he plays challengers he\u2019s there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main tour he wins matches, it\u2019s not like he turns up and always loses in the first round. \u2018He had a bad (wrist) injury last year but has recovered well. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings, although I don\u2019t know exactly how high he can go. I\u2019ve practised with him a couple of times, I haven\u2019t seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would imagine he\u2019s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while.\u2019 Bedene can individually represent any country he wants where he holds a passport. The Davis Cup is a greyer area as from January 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the Slovenian squad three times \u2014 but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process. It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give support to his case but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: \u2018To have another player in the men\u2019s top 100 is clearly a positive thing and so we very much welcome Aljaz\u2019s change in citizenship.\u2019 Murray says Bedene is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings . Murray gets pumped up on his way to victory over Kevin Anderson at the Miami Open . Murray proudly poses with a cake, saying 'It's an amazing feeling' after winning his 500th game . Switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and Evans\u2019s questions have some pertinence to them. There is a recent precedent, however. Two years ago Australian Brydan Klein switched to represent GB by virtue of his mother originally being from Manchester. He subsequently struggled but his form has picked up and he is now ranked 210 in the world to make himself the national No 5. Last year that would have guaranteed a Wimbledon wildcard worth, minimally, a staggering \u00a327,000. However, there is now no automatic recommendation for a Championships wildcard for Brits ranked inside the top 250. The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally popular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairness to him, he proved true to his word. The Great Britain Davis Cup team celebrate their victory against the USA in Glasgow last month .",

Dujardin and Valegro won their their second consecutive Reem Acra FEI World Cup Dressage title in Las Vegas at the weekend -- a trophy to sit alongside Olympic gold and the world and European titles. While their score of 94.196 narrowly missed their own world record in the sport, it was still a full 10 percentage points clear of any rival inside the Thomas & Mack Arena. Dutchman Edward Gal and Glock's Undercover were second with 84.696, ahead of Germany's Jessica von Bredow-Werndl and Unee BB in third with 80.464. \"Valegro just loves his job,\" said Dujardin. \"I don't have to force him to do anything, I just sit there and steer and off I go. There's no sweating, no pushing, no pulling. He knows his job and it's just fantastic\" added Dujardin, who couldn't stop smiling as she was pictured next to an Elvis impersonator after her win. Not everyone finds World Cup success quite that relaxing. Switzerland's Steve Guerdat may be the London Olympic champion, but his Longines FEI World Cup jumping victory in Vegas came at the 10th attempt. Guerdat and Albfuehren's Paille had the last fence down and narrowly avoided a time fault that would have denied them the outright win. \"I don't really want to think about it,\" he joked. \"Coming to the last I knew the time was tight. \"I just went as fast as I could to the finish line, but unfortunately there was a big fence in the way.\" He added: \"I've been three times on the podium, twice in the jump-off and always finished in the top 10. I always wanted to win this.\" The World Cup Finals are among the most prestigious equestrian titles, but the weekend's events in Las Vegas were notable for the success of younger riders. American dressage rider Laura Graves, a 27-year-old who burst onto the international scene with fifth place at last year's World Equestrian Games, improved to fourth in Vegas. Her performance was outdone by Irish showjumper Bertram Allen, who took bronze on Sunday at the age of 19. The teenager is likely to rise through the ranks of the world's top 10 following that performance, while gaining precious Olympic qualification points. Allen and Molly Malone finished behind French rider Penelope Leprevost, on board Vagabond de la Pomme, who took silver.",

A dog walker used nail clippers to free a kidnapped woman who police say was held prisoner and sexually assaulted by a Canadian man for five days. The 27-year-old sex trade worker emerged from a home in Toronto, Canada, bound by handcuffs, badly bruised and naked from the waist down begging for help. Peter Hamilton heard her cries as he was passing by and desperately tried to free her from her restraints. She told him that her kidnapper was still inside, but had fallen asleep. Mr Hamilton wanted to call the police, but had left his cell phone at home, forcing him to take out the only item he had on him - the nail clippers. Police claim Rejean Hermel Perron held the alleged victim at gunpoint on March 31 when she refused to go inside. He is then said to have held the woman for five days,\u00a0subjecting her to sexual assaults including 'ritualistic actions' that officers said they were 'unfamiliar with'. Detectives believe there could be more victims who have yet to come forward. The 43-year-old is alleged to have met the woman, in the Sherbourne and Shuter Street area of the city before the pair returned to his home. The National Post\u00a0reports that she became 'uncomfortable' and made it clear she wanted to leave. But he then allegedly produced the weapon and restrained her with duct tape and handcuffs. Police say she was subjected to multiple sexual assaults. Perron was arrested on Monday and later charged with sexual assault with a weapon, kidnapping, forcible confinement and assault. Describing the dramatic escape, Mr Hamilton told the CBC\u00a0how he was walking his dog in the Dundas Street East and Jones Street area when he heard desperate pleas for help. Hero: Dog walker Peter Hamilton heard the woman's cries for help before he saw her come out of the house bound by restraints and naked from the waist down . Quick thinking: He wanted to call the police but left his cell phone at home, so had to use the only implement he had on him to free the woman - his nail clippers . He said a woman appeared on a veranda of a home but could not move further because of the restraints on her hands and feet. She warned him her kidnapper was still armed and inside the home. Mr Hamilton told CBC: 'My first thought was 'how do I get her out of here?' 'I knew this was a dangerous situation. I couldn't leave her, but I could not go back to my house to get my phone.' When a man emerged from the home, Mr Hamilton stood up ready for a confrontation. But the man then turned and fled, it is reported. Mr Hamilton added:\u00a0'This is where it could have taken a turn for the worse,' said Hamilton. 'He came out and he ran. He saw us and he just ran and that was a very good thing.' 'She was very emotionally distressed and she said, \"I'm sorry I have to put you through this.\" There was nothing to apologize for. 'It's just the right thing to do. We live in a society where sometimes people turn a blind eye to what's going on around them.' In part, he has thankful for having his dog, as he wouldn't have been walking through the neighborhood for any reason. He told the Toronto Star: Without having that dog, I wouldn't have taken a walk through the neighbourhood, and if he hadn't taken a walk, he wouldn't have encountered a shocking crime in progress, and wouldn't have had the opportunity to intervene and possibly save a woman's life. 'Whatever fate or destiny comes into it, the dog has as much of a part. 'The horror of what happened to her, of what she had gone through, hadn't really sunk into me yet. 'What sinks into you is the horror you're seeing right now, which is that there's a naked woman on the floor in handcuffs who needs help.' After he contacted police, Mr Hamilton said he spent the day with his wife and went for a hike out of town. 'That was good. It calmed everybody down,' he said. The woman was rushed to hospital after passers-by called emergency services and is said to be recovering. Crime scene: After Mr Hamilton helped free the woman, a man emerged from the house, so they ran. The alleged victim is now being treated in hospital .",

Audrey Nethery, from Kentucky, has Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a life-threatening bone marrow condition that impacts her body's ability to circulate oxygen. Since Audrey is unable to produce enough red blood cells, her parents told the\u00a0Mirror,\u00a0she has faced a host of health issues in her short life. But the condition doesn't stop Audrey from dancing, which she does incredibly well to Bruno Mars\u2019 chart-topping hit Uptown Funk in a widely-watched video that her family posted on her\u00a0Facebook page. Scroll down for video . Girl can groove: Audrey Nethery, six, has a rare illness called Diamond Blackfan Anemia - but her condition doesn't stop her from dancing adorably in videos from her Zumba class . Family affair: Audrey danced while her dad Scott played guitar at a DBA benefit, pictured here . Audrey learned the cute choreographed routine to the Kidz Bop version of the song at her Zumba class in Louisville, Kentucky. Dad Scott Nethery and mom Julie Haise were quick to upload a clip of the six-year-old dancing to Facebook, and the internet was just as quick to watch it. The recording of her complete performance has already reached 2.8 million views since it was posted in March. But Audrey's cute videos don't just bring joy to those who watch them - they also help bring attention to DBA and raise funds for the\u00a0Diamond Blackfan Anemia Foundation. Get your groove on: Audrey's most popular video sees her dancing along to Bruno Mars' hit Uptown Funk (pictured) Shaking her money maker: Audrey's parents are posting videos of Audrey dancing at Zumba class to raise money for the Diamond Blackfan Anemia Foundation; here, Audrey holds a check for $10,000 . Because of her condition, Audrey has already endured 20 blood\u00a0transfusions, and will likely undergo more in the future. Half of people with DBA need a transfusion once every three to five weeks. She was also born with a hole in her heart and a cleft palate, and she isn't growing as fast as her peers, partly because of the steroids she needs to take for her illness. But despite her hurdles, her father Scott told Daily Mail Online, she has plenty of energy and a positive outlook: 'Audrey is a happy, loving, smart, little girl who loves to dance, listen to music, and collect dolls and stuffed animals. She is incredibly strong and leaves an impression on everyone she meets!' Feeling playful: Audrey's dad says she loves to collect dolls like the one she is holding in this picture with her mother Julie . Major music lover: Audrey's dad Scott, pictured here before taking Audrey to a father-daughter dance, says his little internet star is a big fan of Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift . The musically-inclined six-year-old, whose favorite musicians include Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, and the Beatles, has also left an impression on strangers on the internet. Posting cute videos and smiling photos of Audrey have helped the Nethery family to raise thousands of dollars, as well as promote blood drives which they host to give back to the community. 'Once people realize she has a life-threatening illness, it really touches their hearts,' her father told the Mirror.",

The spacecraft  that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in about a week, Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, said Wednesday. \"Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere,\" Kelly said from the space station. The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, \"After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. \"The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system,\" the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. \"Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft,\" it said. \"Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.\" Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. \"The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station,\" a statement said. \"Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight.\" That next flight, which will be the seventh SpaceX commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had \"confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it.\" According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U.S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, \"all of which are replaceable,\" NASA said. U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, from Maryland, is the current space station commander. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Presto and Amanda Barnett contributed to this report.",

And incredulous that it took so long. Hinton, 58, looked up, took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham, minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985. He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life, under fear of execution, for something he didn't do. \"All they had to do was to test the gun, but when you think you're high and mighty and you're above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody,\" Hinton told reporters. \"But I've got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.\" Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state's motion to dismiss charges against him. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn't be linked to each other. \"Death Row Stories\": Hard questions about the U.S. capital punishment system . The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence, said the Equal Justice Initiative, a group that helped win his release. \"Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice,\" Bryan Stevenson, the group's executive director and Hinton's lead attorney, said of his African-American client. \"I can't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton.\" Stevenson said the \"refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling.\" Amnesty report: Executions down but death sentences on the rise . Dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt, Hinton praised God for his release, saying he was sent \"not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers.\" He said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims. Both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice, he said. \"For all of us that say that we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing, because I shouldn't have (sat) on death row for 30 years,\" he said. Woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs, such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup, Stevenson said. The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and \"sort out what he wants to do,\" Stevenson said.",

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

Caught: Mr Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Ms Khanim by a governor at the school . The school was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and 39-year-old Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on. The teacher has worked at the school for nine years, hiring out a room to offer private tuition to pupils looking to pass the 11+, The Mirror reported. Mr Turnbull has not commented on the tryst, but the school confirmed senior staff had told him to 'never return'. A school spokeswoman said:\u00a0'Once Mr Turnbull's behaviour was discovered by the school's facilities manager, he promptly informed the assistant headteacher. 'Mr Turnbull was challenged; he fully admitted improper behaviour and was then instructed by the assistant headteacher to leave the school site immediately and to not return.' She added that the teacher was not directly employed by the school but he did hire out the classroom for tuition. 'As far as the school is concerned, while behaviour of the sort alleged is wholly unacceptable in any circumstances, we understand from the advice taken from social services that Mr Turnbull had not engaged in any illegal activity.

Elite: The independent Catholic school charges up to \u00a313,000 a year in fees for students to attend . 'There was no pupil involved, the incident was between Mr Turnbull and an adult female,' she added. School regulator Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the Department for Education were all informed of the incident. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Independent schools must adhere to the Independent School Standards. Any suggestion that schools are not doing so will be investigated.' Sources close to the school, however, said Mr Turnbull had been allowed to 'leave by the back door' and were angered that he would be able to continue teaching. Ms Khanim declined to comment but told the Birmingham Mail: 'That's not how it all happened.' The Priory School is attended by around 400 pupils, from 'Nursery and Poppets' classes up until sixth form. It charges fees of up to \u00a312,870 a year for its most senior students. On the school's website, its headmaster Jonathan Cramb says 'knowing what is right and wrong' allows teachers to get on with providing an education for pupils. More than 80 per cent of students got five GCSEs graded A* to C last year, well above the national average.",

Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US.

More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29% to $5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion . 'We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. 'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion \u2014 continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow. Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 14, 2014. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again \u2014 not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to \"rebrand\" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a \"relentlessly, insultingly vapid\" effort of \"demographic box-checking.\" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a \"State Farm commercial gone viral\" and also \"boring as s---.\" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed \"I\" to empathetic \"we.\" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.  In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.  In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a \"T\" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?  Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.  Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming \"Morning in America\"? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.  She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging \"schizophrenia,\" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.",

And now that status update about jetting off on holiday is set to be even easier after Virgin Atlantic announced it would allow each passenger one Facebook login for free so they can post an update from 35,000ft. The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",

Randy Linn was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused over $1million in damages to a suburban Toledo, Ohio, mosque . Federal prosecutors said Linn drove from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo (pictured) in September 20112, broke into the mosque, poured gasoline on a prayer rug and set it on fire .

Linn later said while pleading guilty to hate crime charges that he'd become enraged after seeing images of wounded soldiers in the news and decided to burn the mosque. He also blamed what happened on a day of heavy drinking. Being forgiven, he wrote last December, would 'probably give me a little bit of peace of mind.' Cherrefe Kadri, president of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, told The Blade said she waited nearly six weeks to respond to Linn's letter. Most of the members have moved on, she said. 'I think his letter was truly sincere, and I told him that,' she said. Her response, written on stationery with an image of the mosque at the top, said that she hopes he can make peace with God.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nGarissa, Kenya (CNN)Days after a horrific Al-Shabaab attack on its soil, Kenya launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in Somalia, according to a military source, who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week's massacre at Garissa University College that killed nearly 150 people. \"The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011. It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,\" the military source said Monday. It is customary for Kenyan military sources not to give their names to media. Two of the airstrikes hit Al-Shabaab training camps, according to a resident of the southwest Somalian town of Bardera, almost 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Kenyan border, and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. The Kenyan military began its bombing raids Sunday afternoon, targeting the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Godon Dhawe, Somali resident Ibrahim Mohammed said. Godon Dhawe is between Bardera and the Somalia-Kenya border. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the university attack. Also Monday, a police source said Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre began, arranging for transport. It's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital, roughly 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of the attack, but the police source in Garissa told CNN that Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Journalists on the ground corroborated that report. Once the team entered the university complex, the situation was quickly defused, journalists and the police source said. Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenya's president and deputy president, defended the response time, telling CNN there is always criticism regarding whether \"you reacted as fast as you have or shouldn't have.\" \"With the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better,\" he said, adding that Kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and \"got the job done.\" Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed those remarks in a Monday interview with CNN, saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation. \"We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,\" she said. She repeated Esipisu's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight. \"Obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning, it's always easy to fall back on things like that, but I can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported,\" Mohamed said. \"Obviously hindsight is always 20/20. We did everything that we could do.\" The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud is the mastermind of Thursday's terrorist attack on Garissa University College. The country's Interior Ministry singled out Mohamud, a senior leader of Al-Shabaab, on Twitter. He is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a Kenyan ministry document given to CNN. The ministry posted a \"most wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His position as one of Al-Shabaab's top field commanders in southern Somalia has brought him into direct conflict with Kenyan troops deployed as part of African Union forces in the country. \"This is a man who has a lot of grudges against the Kenyans,\" said Stig Jarle Hansen, an associate professor at Oslo's Norwegian University of Life Sciences and author of \"Al-Shabaab in Somalia: The History and Ideology of a Militant Islamist Group.\" Mohamud's network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's in Kenya's North Eastern Province near Somalia. Garissa, the town where the university attack took place, is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from the Somali border. It's within \"striking distance\" of Mohamud's stronghold in Somalia's Middle Juba province, Hansen told CNN. But he noted that Mohamud is better known \"for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks.\" Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter . Over the weekend, Al-Shabaab promised to bring about \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. Though the terrorist group is based in Somalia, it hasn't confined its violence to the lawless nation. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's attack on a quarry in a Kenyan village near the Somali border, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. He's from a clan, the Ogaden, that has a heavy presence in Kenya and Somalia, Hansen said. \"The borders historically have been meaningless to them,\" he said. CNN exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . On Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\" Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Three days of national mourning for victims of the attack, declared by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, began Sunday.

Inked: Tattoo-loving soldiers in the U.S. Army will soon be able to get inked on their arms and legs thanks to changing rules, officials announced Wednesday . An Army spokeswoman said they will go into effect in the 'very near future.' The changes came as a result of feedback from soldiers. But it wasn't so long ago that the Army made a much different announcement concerning its tattoo policy. Highly unpopular regulations that went into effect in March 2014 banned tattoos below the knee or elbow. Soldiers who already had the ink were grandfathered in. Under those regulations, any soldier with tattoos was barred from seeking a\u00a0promotion to warrant officer or commissioning as an officer. Tattoos have long been a part of military culture, but as they have become more popular, and more prominently displayed on the body, the various branches have been regulating them in to try to maintain a professional look. 'Society is changing its view of tattoos and we have to change along with that,' Odierno said. 'It makes sense. Soldiers have grown up in an era when tattoos are much more acceptable and we have to change along with that.' New rules: Ink may extend all the way to the wrist once the rules go into effect.

That's the mayor's response to an artist's apology and offer to cover the cost of fixing the \"Scary Lucy\" statue that has put the New York town of Celoron in the spotlight this week. The bronze figure of comedian and area native Lucille Ball has elicited comparisons to a \"Walking Dead\" zombie and inspired the Facebook campaign \"We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue.\" The sculpture, a gift to the town from its original owners, has been on display since 2009. Artist Dave Poulin has \"had plenty of opportunity to step forward, and our last conversation he wanted $8,000 to $10,000,\" Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost said. \"And then he stated that if we didn't have the funds and we didn't like the statue, we should take it down and put it in storage.\" After the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend, Poulin publicly apologized Monday for his \"most unsettling sculpture\" in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter. \"I take full responsibility for 'Scary Lucy,' though by no means was that my intent or did I wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic Lucy image,\" Poulin wrote in the letter (PDF). \"From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy's beauty or my ability as a sculptor.\" Poulin said he has been talking to Celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture. It seems that cost has been the chief barrier. \"It puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community, they accept it, and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense.\" Poulin wrote in the letter. But the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind. \"I am willing to put my time and money into redoing the Lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years I can do a much better job,\" Poulin wrote. No thanks, Schrecengost said. He said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue. \"It would be reworked from the shoulders up -- the entire head, neck and shoulders, not just the face,\" Schrecengost said in a news release Tuesday. The town has set up a post office box for donations, which can also be made through Kickstarter. But the controversy may not be over. It seems that nearby Jamestown, New York, also has ties to Lucille Ball's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend. Schrecengost's Tuesday statement referred to an anonymous Facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising Jamestown's Lucille Ball profile at the expense of the Celoron statue. \"The best place for a life size statue of Lucy is right where it is now -- in Lucille Ball Memorial Park in her hometown, in the Village of Celoron, NY,\" he said.

Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing. Riot of colour: The Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year . Superstition: People travel from nearby towns to join the Net Boat Fair. Other Water Temple Fairs are held around Chinese New Year. Fishermen from the area take their boats out for show, hoping for good fortune and blessing . Extravagance: An aerial view of the 2015 China Jiangnan Net Boat Fair which commemorates an ancient hero . Starting on different dates in the western calendar, the fair happens annually according to the Chinese Lunar calendar. This year, it began yesterday and the celebrations are expected to last three to seven days, with festivities sometimes being extended to a month long. One of the highlights of the carnival is the Net Boat Fair which showcases the unique culture of Jiangnan water people. One of the most anticipated performances is the 'tie the perfume to your skin' which sees performers attach metal hooks to their forearms. On the other side of the hook hangs a censer containing incense\u00a0or sometimes even heavy anchors with flowers in them to mask the natural smell of the fishing town. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing . The traditional local folklore carnival pays homage to Liu Chengzhong, a figure who led people in annihilating locusts in the Yuan Dynasty . Tradition: Fishermen and their families dress up in traditional clothes. About 50 different folklore groups and nearly two thousand people will be joining the celebrations. It will be the biggest Net Boat Fair in 60 years . The Fair commemorates General Lui Chengzhong, a hero in the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), who successfully eliminated pests during a massive drought. When the Yuan Dynasty came to an end, General Lui killed himself by jumping in the river as an act of loyalty to the Yuan emperor. The locals built the Lui King temple for him and celebrated his heroic acts. Mr Li, one of the participants, told Jia Xing Ping Dao: 'I am the sixth generation to come to this temple fair. 'My great-grandfather once said the celebrations were even more extravagant than what we have now. 'We want to pray for safety and for the Gods to give us proper weather next year.' Music and beats: Little drums are used to scare away angry spirits. This event was listed as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in China in 2011, along with Chinese abacus, an ancient calculator . Cultural heritage: Fishermen prepare shrine offerings, including food, wine, pork, fruit and snacks. An elaborate ritual will be performed on the boats to give thanks to the Gods and the ancestors . The Net Boat Fair has already been included in the list of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage. One of the most important agenda this year is giving out the 'folklore religion activity' certificate to the Liu King temple. Jiangnan Mayor Liang Bokai sauid: 'This marks the first certificate of its kind. It is a massive step for the preservation, promotion and legacy of this folklore religion in the Liu King temple. 'We will further promote our local customs and culture and combine it with tourism in order to put out a new image.' Jiangnan folklore: 'Stepping on whites boats' is a custom for fishermen. Their boats are known to be very unstable because of the exceptionally long frame. Fishermen remodel the boats with a wooden see-saw in the middle. Two people stands on the edge of both sides and jump to make the boat go forward . Tourism: It is a very popular tourist attraction as well. Vendors and shopkeepers appeal their products to passers-by, participants gather for pictures and others pray for blessings .",

A\u00a014-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day . Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday . Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.' Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain  are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead . Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday . London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

The study uncovered a link between belief in God and other societal characteristics, such as a strong social hierarchy. Scientists suggest that religious beliefs help people cope in inhospitable habitats. A study suggests that societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in all-powerful, deities. Here, people carry bags of popcorn through a Christian cemetery, to sell in a shanty town in Lima, Peru . \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland and a founding director of the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences in Jena, Germany. \u2018Prosocial behaviour [actions that help others] maybe helps people do well in harsh or unpredictable environments.\u2019 Together with other experts, he found that communities that believe in a high, controlling God or gods who enforce a moral code, tend to live in politically complex groups with a social hierarchy beyond the local community - and often tend to animals. While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre (Nescent) in Durham, North Carolina, implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland. Here, devotees prepare ritual rice dishes to offer to the Hindu sun god as they attend Pongal celebrations, at a slum in Mumbai . The UK is one of the least religious places in the world, according to a new survey. In a global ranking of 65 countries, the UK came sixth from last, with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious. This compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are \u2018convinced atheists\u2019, with the remaining Britons saying they \u2018did not know\u2019. In contrast, 94 per cent of people in Thailand deem themselves religious, with Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia and Morocco completing the top five, with 93 per cent each. At the bottom of the list was China, where 61 per cent of people are atheists, with only six per cent regarding themselves as religious. It was followed by Japan where just 13 per cent are religious, Sweden with 19 per cent and the Czech Republic on 23 per cent. Globally two-thirds of people consider themselves religious. Those under the age of 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups, the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found. People without a formal education were also more likely to practice a faith. \u2018When researchers discuss the forces that shaped human history, there is considerable disagreement as to whether our behaviour is primarily determined by culture or by the environment,\" said primary author Carlos Botero, of North Carolina State University. \u2018We wanted to throw away all preconceived notions regarding these processes and look at all the potential drivers together to see how different aspects of the human experience may have contributed to the behavioural patterns we see today.\u2019 The study, published in PNAS, took into account variables associated with the environment, history, and culture and involved experts in biology, ecology, linguistics, anthropology, and theology. It began when evolutionary ecologist Dr Botero plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising, high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds. He took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion, and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation. Professor Gray said: \u2018Although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive, the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically, we get some insight.\u2019 While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study  implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. Here, Muslims on the outskirts of New Delhi participate in Friday prayers at a slum area during the holy month of Ramadan . The team used historical, social, and ecological data, such as plant growth, rain and temperature, for 583 societies to illustrate the multifaceted relationship between belief in moralising, high gods and external variables. They used the Ethograhic Atlas, which was collated during the last century, to pinpoint communities around the world and access data about religious beliefs, agriculture, and animal husbandry. \u2018The goal became not just to look at the ecological variables, but to look at the whole thing. 'Once we accounted for as many other factors as we could, we wanted to see if we could still detect an environmental effect,\u2019 Dr Botero said. \u2018The overall picture is that these beliefs are ultimately shaped by a combination of historical, ecological, and social factors.\u2019 Dr Botero believes that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in examining human behaviour from a cross-disciplinary standpoint. The team plans to further their study by exploring the processes that have influenced the evolution of other human behaviours including taboos, circumcision, and the modification of natural habitats. Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous - a phenomenon known as The Scrooge Effect, after the Dickens character (shown) Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous, according to a new study. It also boosts the feeling of pleasure we get from doing a good deed. \u2018Acting pro-socially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety, and in turn produces psychological satisfaction,\u2019 researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. The study builds on the terror management theory, which says that humans deal with our fear of death by believing in an afterlife or devoting our lives to a cause that will live on, Pacific Standard reported. Previous work found that Americans reminded of their own mortaility gave more money to a charity that said it would help people in the country, than one that had an international focus. It suggested that thoughts of death made people strengthen their beliefs - such as allegiance to a religion or country \u2013 and is known as The Scrooge Effect. The new study included an experiment, where people were asked to split $8 between themselves and a stranger, while reporting their own satisfaction. Before this, Polish student participants were asked to fill out a survey about death, or dealing with a trip to the dentists, then complete a crossword. The researchers found that volunteers who had previously thought about death gave more money to the stranger and said they felt happier doing it. The experiment seems to bolster The Scrooge Effect and suggests that reinforcing a person\u2019s self-image of being generous, or supporting a cause, are effective ways of managing fear of dying.",

Beating Crystal Palace was a massive result for Steve Bruce. Their run-in is horrendous and had they lost at Selhurst Park, surely it was all over. It shows how football fortunes can change in an instant. Hull are not the best away from home but as the stats below show, they thoroughly deserved their win. Dame N\u2019Doye was the star and could have had a hatful but I love the way he took his second. That little delay of his foot was just enough to put the defender off balance and give him a sight of goal before firing it in. Bruce had to move quickly to sign him on deadline day in February but N\u2019Doye has done well since joining from Lokomotiv Moscow. If he carries on like this and Hull stay up they might have to build a statue outside the ground! Dame N'Doye  celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Premier League win against Crystal Palace . Can Manuel still be the man? After recent results, people say Manuel Pellegrini is a dead man walking. Beating Aston Villa was important but can he keep his job under so much pressure? Deciding Pellegrini\u2019s fate will be one of the toughest choices Man City\u2019s owners have faced. I spoke to Frank Lampard and he says they are fantastic people \u2014 there is no desire to chop and change. City are so close. They have world class training facilities, an expanding stadium and absolute fortunes to spend. But this season has been a blip. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during the Premier League match against Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium . Pellegrini won two trophies last year, so they could keep him and let him rebuild. Recruitment has been poor and they need to get it right in the summer. But it\u2019s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year. If he is sacked, who gets the job? Pep Guardiola is the dream but it would take a major fallout for him to leave Bayern. Patrick Vieira has the tools but no experience, Jurgen Klopp would be appointed on past success and Diego Simeone is an underdog manager. City want style. There is no shame losing to Barcelona, it\u2019s the defeats to the likes of Burnley and Stoke that have hurt Pellegrini. City could still get rid of him, but I\u2019m sure it would be with a heavy heart. Manchester City are dreaming of Pep Guardiola but it's unlikely the Bayern boss will make the move to City . Flying Foxes . Talk about timing your run. Leicester are in amazing form. Four straight wins is good for any side, let alone one facing a relegation battle. It\u2019s been a tough season for Nigel Pearson with all the drama of him being \u2018sacked\u2019 and reinstated, but he has got his team flying at exactly the right time. Home disadvantage? There were only two home wins this weekend with three away and five draws. At this stage in the season sometimes it\u2019s far easier to play with freedom on the road than under huge pressure at home. Toon's poor show . The way Newcastle are going I would not be surprised if they don\u2019t get a single point between now and the end of the season. They have been an embarrassment. It\u2019s as if they are in the clubhouse with 35 points. They don\u2019t look like adding to that any time soon and anybody with Newcastle in their run-in has got a chance of a result. A deflated Jack Colback and Siem de Jong trudge off the pitch following yet another Newcastle defeat . The Newcastle players react as they suffer yet another defeat, this time to Premier League rivals Swansea . Chaos at Watford, but it works . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates scoring for Watford against Brighton at the Amex Stadium . Watford have spent 20 days at the top of the Championship table. Bournemouth, who are on the verge of promotion, have led for 111 days. Congratulations to Watford after their promotion, but if ever you want an example of how not to run a club, they have been it this season! With unpredictable owners, four different managers and a host of key players on loan, it has been chaos. They have been outsiders throughout but have come through when it counts. I\u2019ve loved watching Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo bang in the goals and you can\u2019t argue with the results. It just shows you there\u2019s no right or wrong in football. The Watford players celebrate victory against Brighton as they all but secure their promotion to the big time . United slip up . Two weeks ago Man United had all the answers but two defeats later it\u2019s back to the drawing board. It\u2019s not that they have been found out, but maybe they are not as good as people thought. They were just in good form. They have had the luxury of playing with no European football this season so still have work to do in the summer. It\u2019s the same feeling with Everton. They started the season dreadfully but have won five out of six. I\u2019m a Roberto Martinez fan and they have good players so we should not be surprised that things have changed. Louis van Gaal watches on as his Manchester United side are comprehensively beaten by Everton . Paying the penalty . Why oh why did Danny Ings not take that penalty for Burnley? Yes, he is out of form and without a goal since February but what better way to get back on the scoresheet? He took one against Aston Villa in November and scored and he and Burnley needed that goal. Then to make things worse Leicester go up the other end and score 27 seconds later. Burnley midfielder Matthew Taylor holds his head after missing the chance to score from the spot . It was a similar story at QPR. Charlie Austin\u2019s goals have kept his side going this season but he has missed two big penalties now \u2014 against Hull and West Ham. When every goal is so vital you can\u2019t afford to pass up these chances. PS If QPR go down, Austin won\u2019t be the only player with plenty of suitors. Matt Phillips has been scoring and setting up good goals in the run-in. He is a useful Premier League player. Charlie Austin looks on angrily following his penalty miss against West Ham United at Loftus Road .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA gel made from patients' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse. The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.",

A gambling addict stole more than \u00a322,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number,\u00a0cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into\u00a0care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to \u00a3200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing \u00a322,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just \u00a31,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was  discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash\u00a0withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for\u00a0the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said:\u00a0'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has\u00a0really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing.\u00a0'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said:\u00a0'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting\u00a0for it for a long time. 'She does take full responsibility - and realises the impact it has had on\u00a0the family. Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley . 'This offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking\u00a0after the victim's finances. Her gambling spiralled out of control. 'She tried to take her own life.' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and\u00a0seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you. And the fact the funds you\u00a0took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to\u00a0some extent to pay for his care home fees. 'I can't ignore the fact that addictions do exist and there is no other\u00a0motivation.' She was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid\u00a0work and be part of a supervision requirement for 18 months. The judge also stated that \u00a31,350 would be confiscated for compensation and any sums recovered in the future should be paid to Mr Woodrow.

Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days after her initial report to police saying she was groped by Weinstein during a 'business meeting' at his office in Manhattan. It has been claimed the delay was because the Italian model and her manager were working behind the scenes to try and land her a film role. But once the 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to pursue the criminal case, sources told the New York Post. See below for video . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan last Friday night . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . After filing her police report on Friday, March 27, Battilana was eventually interviewed by Manhattan DA prosecutors on Wednesday, April 1, at the NYPD Special Victims Squad's office in East Harlem. Sources told the New York Post her former lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, withdrew from the case as he was concerned Battilana did not appear to be a 'serious victim'. The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and even tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat. But her new lawyer, David Godosky, refuted the claims, saying: 'She immediately went to the police, immediately cooperating with the Special Victims Squad.' Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse yesterday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Weinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall. The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night. She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported. Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'",

Residents from Fairdale,\u00a0an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could. But buildings in the settlement were virtually flattened when the vortex slammed into the area at around 7pm on Thursday night. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way. Geraldine M Schultz, 67, and Jacklyn K. Klosa, 69, were killed in her home by the storm, authorities announced, while around a dozen people were injured. This aerial photo shows a path of destruction, after a tornado swept through the small town of Fairdale, Illinois . Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could . The DeKalb County Sheriff's Office bused residents back to the scene of the devastation so they could begin to take stock of what was left of their property. Seeing the wreckage up close for the first time since Thursday's storms left some amazed that they survived. 'I thought my parents were dead,' said 32-year-old Adam Davis, who hopped into his truck Thursday and raced along with the tornado in the hopes of getting to his parents' house and rescuing them before the twister struck. He found them standing in their doorway frozen in disbelief and grabbed them just in time. On Saturday, he was helping collect what could be salvaged from his childhood home, now full of debris, its roof ripped off and its windows broken. 'It's not necessarily the mementos yet; it's the essentials for now. One step at a time,' he said. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms, the National Weather Service confirmed Saturday. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people. Debris surrounds a plot where a house once stood in the farming community. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way . The weather service gave it a preliminary EF4 rating \u2014 its second strongest \u2014 with winds of between 180 and 200 mph. It was a half-mile wide and remained on the ground for at least 28.7 miles, a record long path for that part of Illinois. Al Zammuto, a 60-year-old machinist, was preparing to inspect what was left of the roof on a former schoolhouse that he had been transforming into his home over the past year. He will have to start over. 'I don't know how much of the roof came off,' he said. 'I'm going to climb a ladder later today and see.' In all, some 70 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Fairdale, authorities said. Another 50 buildings were hit in nearby Rochelle. All buildings have been searched, but not all residents have been accounted for, so cadaver dogs are being used in parts of DeKalb County, the Illinois State Police said late Friday. The tornado blew numerous vehicles from nearby interstates, and troopers helped rescue a trapped driver in an overturned semi-trailer. As the cleanup began, tales of survival continued to emerge. The vortex created a path through the fields and wiped out a house as it made its way to the town. A building is left standing in a property above . Kelly Newman, 46, lost her Rochelle home. For her, the storm began with a moment of playful wonder at the size of the hail. She ran outside to collect some of the pieces to put it in the freezer to show her children. 'Then I noticed to the southwest there was a huge black funnel thing, but it didn't look like a tornado because it was just way too wide,' she said. But the telltale train-like roar sent them and their 19-year-old daughter running for the basement. The house cracked and collapsed around them, raining down debris and a dusting of what she described as 'muddy soot.' The family survived, and several police officers helped free her husband, who had been trapped nearly upside down between two collapsed walls. 'We're alive, we were spared. Our lives were saved,' she said. A destroyed house is seen in Fairdale is pictured on Friday, hours after a tornado ripped through the community .

Lyvette Crespo, 43, entered the plea to a grand jury indictment. She was ordered held on $150,000 bail and could face up to 21 years in state prison if convicted. Crespo shot Bell Gardens Mayor Daniel Crespo three times in the chest on September 30. The killing came after the late mayor's years of domestic abuse, the widow claims. However, the late Crespo's brother says those claims are all a lie and that he has evidence proving Mrs. Crespo is a cold-blooded killer. Indicted: Lyvette Crespo (right) allegedly shot her husband,\u00a0Bell Gardens, California Mayor Daniel Crespo (left), in September during a heated argument about his infidelity. She's now been indicted on charges of voluntary manslaughter . History of abuse? The Crespos were high school sweethearts. Mrs. Crespo claims her husband had become increasingly abusive in the months leading to his death. She says she shot him after he punched their son, who'd tried intervening during an argument . In text messages that brother, William Crespo, provided to the LA Times, Mrs. Crespo appears to have threatened to shoot her husband at least once before doing the deed. 'I'll find out who ... u got flowers for. Has to be a bell gardens wh***,' reads a message from Lyvette to her husband. Mr. Crespo replied: 'It better last time U threaten to shoot me in head!!!' In a civil suit filed against Lyvette on behalf of his mother, William Crespo has asked for more than $53 million in damages for the death of his brother, who he says was killed 'with malice and in cold blood,' by Mrs. Crespo. Crespo has told authorities it was self-defense after he punched their 19-year-old son in the face after he intervened in the couple's argument. Counter claim:\u00a0Daniel Crespo's brother William (pictured) says his ex sister-in-law's claims are all lies and that she killed her husband in cold blood . Broken family: In this file photo, attorney Claudia Osuna holds a photo of the Crespo family - from top left to bottom right, Bell Gardens, Calif., Mayor Daniel Crespo, his daughter Crystal, his wife Lyvette and son Daniel Crespo Jr. Daniel Crespo Jr. called 911 to report the shooting, telling a dispatcher: 'He's on the floor dying. He hurt me.' Daniel Crespo, a Los Angeles County deputy probation officer, was elected in 2001 to the City Council of Bellflower, a city of about 42,000 residents. The mayor's position rotated among council members. He and his wife were high school sweethearts and married as teenagers in 1986. However, the autopsy report contained allegations by a daughter, Crystal Crespo, that her father had been verbally and physically abusive toward her mother over two decades. She said the abuse had become more physical in recent years because of arguments over Daniel Crespo's infidelity, but it was never reported and never left serious injuries. Daniel Crespo's brother, William Crespo, has denied the abuse allegations. The mayor's mother filed a $53 million lawsuit last fall in which she calls Crespo a 'cold-blooded killer' who picked a fight with her husband knowing their son would intervene. What happened?

The inquiry will also look into nine other centres in Nottinghamshire where children were said to have been physically or sexually abused. Skegby Hall in Mansfield, which was a former children's care home. Police have launched an investigation looking into claims of sexual abuse at the home . The 10 centres, all of which have either closed or changed their use since the time of the alleged abuse, also includes Whatton Youth Detention Centre. Also being investigated are three former residential centres in Mansfield and five others in Worksop, Southwell and Stapleford. The inquiry will have a team of 20 people looking into the abuse claims and will also include two social workers. Three of the 23 allegations relate to a former youth detention centre, where teenage inmates were detained with the oldest claim dating back to the 1940s. Police will look at whether the abuse was systematic or organised. However, they say they are aware many of the records relating to the homes may no longer exist and that some of the alleged perpetrators may have died.

Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment: \u00a0This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady\u2019s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead\u2019s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration:\u00a0Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nTehran, Iran (CNN)Traveling to Iran these days, the mood among many people and the government can probably best be described using two words: confident and optimistic. After a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between Iran and world powers, many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon. Businesses are already gearing up for a time after the restrictions are lifted, and many people anticipate a huge boost to the economy. \"Naturally we are all very happy,\" one woman in central Tehran told us. \"We expect better days economically and culturally. We want better relations with the rest of the world.\" Another man added, \"I have a good feeling about it, because my country will be free of the fear of war.\" But this weekend, just a few miles down the road, Iran's leaders were celebrating their war machine as the military held its annual National Army Day parade. As the U.S., Saudi Arabia and other countries criticize Iran for its alleged involvement in funding and supplying the Houthi rebels who have seized power in much of Yemen, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has praised the military as peacemakers for the Middle East. \"Today, our army is the source of our national stability,\" Rouhani said in his speech at the parade. \"And even more than that -- it is also a source of security and stability in the entire region.\" The country's top military brass seemed surprisingly relaxed and unusually willing to speak with Western media outlets. Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, the Chief of Staff of Iran's armed forces and a man who is close to Rouhani, told CNN he hopes the U.S. and Iran can work closer together to fight ISIS in Iraq. \"The unity of humanity based on the right of all human beings to live, and their right to freedom, dictates that all human society is threatened by ISIS, and all humans should unite against ISIS and work against them,\" Firouzabadi said. Firouzabadi also repeated Iran's longstanding claim that the U.S. is partly responsible for creating ISIS, which now controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. \"If the Americans really didn't create ISIS, and if they want to destroy ISIS, it is possible for them to achieve that,\" he said. \"But we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the U.S. and Britain. We hope that one day, because of their national interests and the will of their nations, the U.S. and the UK will decide to really fight ISIS.\" Iran has often dismissed the coalition air campaign as ineffective, while praising its own strategy of training, advising, outfitting and directing Iraqi Shia militias, Kurdish forces and the Iraqi military. But in another apparent softening of rhetoric, a top military official said he hopes that the animosity between Iran and America will fade. \"At the moment, we consider the United States to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us,\" General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, the commander of Iran's ground forces, told CNN. \"We would like the U.S. to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in the U.S. military leadership,\" Pourdastan continued. \"We trust the American people, but the tone of U.S. government and military officials is such that we still consider the U.S. a threat.\" At the same time, Iran's leadership is showing no sign of toning down its own fiery rhetoric -- and the usual \"Death to Israel, death to the U.S.A.\" chants echoed around the crowds at the military parade. The U.S. welcomes some of Iran's support for Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS, but says at this point that there simply is no basis for deeper cooperation on the battlefield. And for Iran's part, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also rejected direct coordination between the two long-time adversaries. And even though many Iranians have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal, the leadership in Washington and Tehran is far more skeptical. In a recent televised speech, Khamenei said it was possible that there would be no deal by the June 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all. And Iran's army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites. Meanwhile, the White House has been confronted by a Congress that is largely hostile to the negotiations, and has been making the case that a deal cannot be about trust, but about monitoring and verification. \"Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't abide by its agreement, that we don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said last Friday. \"That's our main concern. And I think that goal, of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation, that goal can be met.\" So far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week. But despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air, there is also fear that things could fall apart if Tehran and Washington aren't willing to make tough concessions.",

Patients at Wolfson Children's Hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them. Scroll down for video . The toys include a long 'tail' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. The Idaho firm behind the system\u00a0has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the US, letting anyone play with cats via the system - and plans to sell a version for pet owners via Kickstarter next month. 'Play through programs like the Play with Cats project has a powerful normalizing effect on a child's hospital stay,' said Wolfson Children's Hospital President Michael Aubin. Patients who are in isolation with a specific treatment or a chronic medical condition like cystic fibrosis or bone marrow transplant will be among the first to benefit. Made possible with a $15,000 grant from the Mattel Children's Foundation, the Play with Cats program connects to 151 hospital rooms throughout Wolfson Children's Hospital via GetWellNetwork. The Wolfson Children's Hospital Auxiliary first started a Pet Therapy Program in 1995. Two years ago, the hospital opened a pet visitation program, allowing children with long-term stays or in end-of-life situations to receive a visit from their own dog. 'This is the latest program to be implemented at Wolfson Children's Hospital to give more of our patients a chance to interact with a kitten or cat, which provides a welcome distraction.' said Pat Kirkland, Family Support Services Manager at Wolfson Children's Hospital. 'About 20 percent of our patients are on isolation at some time during their stay, so we are excited to bring the healing power of an animal friend to the bedside.' 'Our partnership with Wolfson Children's Hospital began with JHS veterinarians providing required vet checks and vaccines that allow patients in the hospital to visit with their own dogs. 'We are proud to expand the partnership using iPet so that all patients may benefit from the healing power of animals,' said Denise Deisler, executive director of the Jacksonville Humane Society. The system was developed by Idaho firm ReachIn. 'The idea came from the ability to move anything over the web,' Scott Harris of the firm told MailOnline. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. 'We started working on the technical side of remote control, and then an engineer went home to work on arm overnight. The next day he came in, took me to one side and said he'd been moving the arm, and his cat had started playing with it. He admitted he then hadn't got any work done and spent the evening watching the cat play - so I thought we might be on to something.' The firm contacted a local animals shelter and worked with them to build three toys. In May 2012, the first catcam went online, and was a huge success. Users join a virtual queue, and can then control three toys and a webcam in the enclosure. The iCompanion site that visitors play with cats in rescue homes around the US virtually . Now the firm plans to expand the idea after huge interest from shelters. Users from 90 countries played within 2 weeks playing, and adoption rates went up 57% at shelters, said Harris. The firm is now trying to work out how to fund the systems after over 300 charities got in touch wanting it. The firm is launching a kickstarter campaign to allow people to buy their own version of the system on May 1st. Users can control a variety of toys in the enclosures . 'it costs us to build these things and maintain them, and 317 shelters have requested it, so we are working with as many as we can.' The firm hopes to develop a low cost version costing around $200 for shelters, but admits the R&D costs are currently too high. The user is shown a live video feed to they can see their cat reacting to the toys . Kitten cam! Cats at a shelter in the Us play wiht the internet controlled toys .",

Neither player were happy with referee Milorad Mazic, both feeling that their challenges weren't strong enough to be punished with a card.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)In 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called \"comfort women\" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the \"comfort women\" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the \"comfort women\" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the \"comfort women.\" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national \"coming to terms with the past\" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving \"comfort women\" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.",

Garry Monk is out to claim a season-first against Hull by picking up a point after an international break . The Swansea boss gestures towards his striker Bafetimbi Gomis during a training session this week . It is a campaign which has exceeded so many expectations but Swansea have yet to pick up a point after an international break this term, although in mitigation those have been away games at Chelsea, Stoke and Manchester City. 'International breaks are never easy because it does disrupt your preparations but we have to put that right on Saturday,' Monk said ahead of Hull's visit to the Liberty Stadium. 'A lot of the players come back later on in the week and you might get only two or three days preparation with some of them.

But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch. 'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said. 'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go.

This map shows the Vishwamitri River, near Vadodara, where the attack by the crocodile took place . Vankar said she went to wash her clothes in the river as there was a lack of water and electricity in the village . After hearing the commotion, villagers rushed to help and drove Kanta to hospital, where doctors were treated her for a leg injury. She has since been discharged. Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.' She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return. A wildlife officer said the river is home to ferocious crocodiles and villagers have been warned to steer clear of the river. 'She has miraculously survived. These crocodiles are huge and ferocious,' Ashok Pandya, Vadodara wildlife officer told the Times of India. 'We have been warning them not to go near the river.' Last year, six people were killed in crocodile attacks across Vadodara. There are more than 200 crocodiles in the\u00a0Vishwamitri River.

He said: 'The work dried up pretty fast. No one would touch me with a barge pole because I was on Big Brother. 'When I left the house I was led down the garden path with a lot of things. 'I felt like I was not being allowed to do what I wanted - I was a puppet.' Pete Bennett leaves the Big Brother House as the winner during the final of Big Brother Seven on August 18, 2006 . Although Pete has had a tumultuous time since leaving the house, one area where he has made great strides is overcoming his Tourette's Syndrome. The star claims that when he was younger, he had one of the worst cases of the condition in Europe. On the show, he would involuntarily hit his throat, twitch and shout out swear words, particularly the word 'w*****s'. But during his appearance on Jeremy Kyle, Pete's behaviour was far more controlled. Although he had the occasional twitch and still appeared quite hyperactive, he held back from shouting out any unplanned words. Unfortunately, as well as he battle with drugs, Pete's personal life and career prospects have also been marred with difficulty over the last nine years. A week before he left the Big Brother house in August 2006, Pete started an ill-fate relationship with fellow contestant Nikki Grahame but it quickly fizzled out. A month later Nikki revealed that Pete had called time on the romance. Nikki Grahame and Pete arrive for the National Television Awards in 2006. The couple started a relationship after leaving the Big Brother \u00a0house . Pete at a signing of his book in November 2006 . Pete then started dating one of his good friends, Gemma Costin, better known as Cherry, who he'd had a secret crush on for three years. The pair continued to date for eight years before marrying in a fake ceremony at Glastonbury festival in 2011, before sealing the deal with an official ceremony on the reality show Four Weddings in early 2014. But last \u00a0September he revealed in a Facebook post that they were getting divorced after just six months of marriage. After years of running from his problems by getting high on drugs, Pete finally decided to seek proper help by getting in contact with a drugs counselor a few years ago. He said: 'You don't know you're out of control until it suddenly hits you. 'When I went to get proper help for my addiction, this drug worker started to ask me about loss and I talked to him about all of the friends I\u2019d had who died. 'I hadn\u2019t been dealing with it. I was dealing with it by taking Ketamine and not dealing with it. 'I had to deal with my friends deaths and that's what got me off the Ketamine.' Pete at the\u00a0opening night of Glastonbury last year . Since getting clean, Pete admits that he has relapsed but states that he is now back on track. He said: '\u00a0I took Ketamine again and I relapsed but I hated it, I didn\u2019t like being disassociated. 'I like being here now and being able to chat to people. I'm living my life now the best I can. 'I'm not Perfect Pete anymore, I\u2019m just Pete.' The star is now trying to get his life back together and is attempting to make his name as an actor. He said: 'I do wish I'd done things differently but I've got a plan. 'I\u2019ve got into acting, I'm doing loads of films and working my way up the ladder. 'My Tourette\u2019s has calmed down so I thought, why not give it a chance.\u00a0We have to start somewhere. 'I've got my eye on Hollywood.'",

Dai Young\u2019s side became the third of four English challengers to be dispatched from Europe\u2019s premier event over a punishing weekend, but this was no meek capitulation. Despite the chronic inconvenience of losing Nathan Hughes to a contentious ban and Christian Wade to an untimely injury, the visitors raged gallantly against the dying of the light. Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt . New Zealander Williams rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin-binned .

Replacements: Festuccia, McIntyre, Cooper-Woolley, Gaskell,\u00a0Young, C. Davies, Goode, Leiua. Tries: Helu (2) Conversions: Goode. Penalties: Lozowski (2) Referee: George Clancy (Ireland) Toulon are back-to-back continental champions, awash with Test talent, but they were given a scare by their tenacious opponents \u2014 and even forced to adopt sly, illegal tactics to survive a second-half fightback. Seven minutes from full-time amid a cacophony at Stade Felix Mayol, Wasps launched a daring raid from their own 22 which eventually culminated in a second try for Will Helu, but it also featured a miscarriage of justice. Former All Black lock Ali Williams pulled back Elliot Daly off the ball as he ran clear in support of Joe Simpson. It was surely one of the most obvious offences of its type ever committed in the sport, yet Williams not only avoided a yellow card, but he was on hand to touch down three minutes from time for the try which distorted the final scoreline. Wasps were left battered and beaten, but richly deserving of the ovations from their pockets of supporters around the ground. Captain James Haskell\u2019s work-load was worthy of three men and Andrea Masi also gave body and soul to the cause, while Simpson and Daly were outstanding. Toulon playmaker Frederic Michalak pulls the strings for the defending European champions . Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Toulon fans celebrate after the opening try from their giant French centre Mathieu Bastareaud . CLERMONT v SARACENS,\u00a0Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade V\u00e9lodrome, Marseille, Sunday, \u00a0 \u00a0 April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) There was a certain sense of inevitability about the outcome, but Wasps refused to accept that they were out-gunned, even when Toulon were able to summon the likes of Matt Giteau and Juan Fernandez Lobbe from their stellar cast of reserves. Young was delighted with how his side had performed, once they stopped being so deferential. \u2018I\u2019m really proud of the effort and the commitment,\u2019 he said. \u2018There was real frustration in the first half, because we gave them a bit too much respect in the first 30 minutes. We were a little bit frantic, a little bit panicky, but we will learn from that and I thought we played some really good stuff on occasions. I\u2019m pleased that we were in it right to the end.\u2019 Wasps defence descend on Toulon's Guilhem Guirado at the Felix Mayol Stadium on Sunday . Toulon speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground . Asked about Williams\u2019 illegal tug on Daly\u2019s shirt, Young added: \u2018There were three people (in the ground) who didn\u2019t see it\u2026 the referee and the two touch judges.\u2019 Toulon went ahead when Mathieu Bastareaud blasted over the line from close range in the eighth minute and, as their pack took control, Frederic Michalak was able to dispatch five first-half penalties. The Top 14 leaders went into the break 22-6 up, but Wasps turned the tables as Daly scorched down the right to tee up Helu\u2019s first try. Michalak\u2019s sixth penalty appeared to settle the holders, but Helu touched down for the second time after another crucial intervention by the outstanding Daly. When Williams went over to quell the uprising moments later, it secured Toulon a semi-final against Leinster in Marseille, and left Wasps to head home craving another shot at this tournament next season.",

The Labor Department reported on Thursday that the number of jobless Americans in their 20s armed with a four-year or advanced degree rose to 12.4per cent last year from 10.9per cent in 2013. Philip Gardner, director of Michigan State University's Collegiate Employment Research Institute, told the Associated Press that engineering and business majors have the most chance on landing a job in today's competitive market. Hire me! The unemployment rate for college graduates grew by 1.5per cent in 2014, despite President Obama's promise to reverse the trend (stock photo) And Holly Proffitt, employer relations coordinator in the career services office at Arkansas State University, confirmed Gardner's observations. 'We can't graduate enough engineers,' she said. Despite the recent news, in a survey\u00a0of employers last fall by Michigan State University, the employment center found that hiring of graduates  will rise 16per cent this year. Indeed, the consulting and accounting firm EY is aggressively recruiting on college campuses this spring. It plans to hire 9,000 graduates from U.S. universities this year, up from 7,500 in 2014. The overall unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5per cent in March from 6.7per cent at the end of 2013. Apparently employers have more openings to fill because Baby Boomers are retiring and more workers are feeling confident enough about the economy to switch jobs. Overall, the United States generated 3.1 million jobs last year, the most since 1999. In particular, employer demand for so-called STEM graduates - in science, technology, engineering and mathematics - was highest. Offering hope to non-STEM students, Gardner said of the future job market: 'There seems to be a lot of room for everybody. . . \u00a0Even arts and humanities are making a comeback.'",

When the reality TV star once shared a snap mid-way through her makeover revealing her contouring tricks, a new beauty craze was born. And now, the secret behind the 34-year-old reality TV star's glowing skin has been revealed. Scroll down for video . Want to look like Kim Kardashian? Now you can, because the flawless star has revealed the products that give her that envy-inducing glow . The mother-of-one, who shared her beauty essentials on Instagram, protects her skin with a \u00a365 ($96) Creme de la Mer\u00a0SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, which claims to prevent the appearance of discolorations while providing protection from the sun. The cream, which is packed with gemstones, peculiar sounding 'photonic spheres' and smart seaweeds, can also be used as a make-up primer. Kim shared her beauty essentials on her Instagram page and, of course, a hairbrush from her own brand featured . Kim then loves to spritz her face with a \u00a312 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier. The little-known product is made with roses and aloe and aims to to hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake. The brand say the product is also 'excellent as a make-up refresher and midday pick-me-up'. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a NARS face wash and Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System. The NARS Gentle Cream Cleanser apparently helps to maintain skin's moisture balance while removing makeup and impurities. Meanwhile, the vibrating brush uses a micro-massage motion, which is said to work within skin's natural elasticity to gently remove the impurities traditional methods leave behind-leaving skin softer, smoother and more beautiful. Clearly it's working for Kim. Other beauty essentials in her cosmetics bag include a hairbrush from her own range, Kardashian Beauty, which she established with her sisters, as well as an Essie nail polish. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Kim said: 'As far as products, I love the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.' Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'. 'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping'. The brow groomer uses the Dipbrow Pomade, which she applies with her \u00a315.50 Brow Wiz, an ultra-fine brow pencil, which claims to fill in sparse brows for a naturally fuller appearance. She then defines and enhances the brows with her \u00a317 Brow Powder Duo, which is enriched with Vitamins C and E to nourish and protect, before sealing the powder make-up into place with her \u00a315 Beauty Genius Clear Waterproof Gel, which she says seals and waterproofs any loose powder. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, left,\u00a0loves to spritz her face with a \u00a312 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier, centre, and protect her skin from the sun with\u00a0a \u00a365 ($96) Creme de la Mer SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, right . As well as running a successful beauty empire with her sisters, Kim has revealed that she wants to design a range of handbags for toddlers. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star - who has 22-month-old daughter North with husband Kanye West - is set to launch her Kardashian Kids collection next week and has revealed she's already thinking about adding more accessories to the range. Asked about designing shoes or handbags, she told Vogue.com: 'Well, North does love handbags. And anything where there's a little bit of glitz.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping' The 34-year-old beauty admits that while her daughter is a big fan of fancy shoes, she's not so keen on the range of headbands included in her mother's new collection. Kim explained: 'Every day she wakes up and says, \"shoes\". You have to bargain with her - before you change her diaper she needs a pair of shoes on ... She hasn't been the biggest fan of keeping something on her head.' Kardashian Kids launches on Nordstrom.com on April 13 with prices ranging between $25 (\u00a316.80) and $35 (\u00a323.60) and Kim admits that while she did a lot of research online, she also drew inspiration from her own wardrobe which is why the collection features pieces such as peplum tops and faux leather leggings.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe family of a heavily pregnant Jehovah's Witness who died along with her baby after she refused a blood transfusion, have defended the woman who they said had put her baby's life above her own. Jenny-Lee, 28, was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy, and although doctors at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy, she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion. However her mother Heather has told The Daily Telegraph that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child, named Aroura. 'She knew chemo would kill Aroura \u2014 she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened, she wanted that baby alive,' Heather said. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . 'We were told she would have six weeks to live \u2014 she fought to have the baby. That's the decision she made \u2014 she gave up her life.' Instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter's unnecessary death, claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner, but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy. The Sydney mother's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. Jenny-Lee's elder daughter Chelsie, who was only 10 when her mother died in August 2009, also defended her mother. However the 28-year-old's brother David blamed the religion for how his sister died, calling her a 'fool'. 'It was not my sister who was sad and selfish, it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense,' he said. Jenny-Lee, 28, had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' She was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a\u00a0challenge\u00a0to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. In a recent article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber\u00a0Biscoe wrote:\u00a0'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.

The scathing critics told the six-months pregnant meteorologist Kristi Gordon that her 'front end looks like the Hindenburg\u00a0and your rear end looks like a brick s***house.' Fans jumped to support her when Gordon read out excerpts from the letters and emails on TV, but it seems that abuse of pregnant TV presenters daring to get on with their jobs during their pregnancy is nothing new. Australian presenter and model Nicky Buckley famously soldiered on with her presenting job on The Sale of the Century after falling pregnant in 1997, continuing to wear the glamorous, figure-hugging gowns her job required of her. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the barrage of abuse that was bestowed upon my unborn baby and me by a multitude of critics who were determined to dampen the joyous marvel of pregnancy,' Buckley, now 49, writes in her newly-released memoir. Scroll down for video . Pregnant and proud: Buckley copped heavy criticism for showing bump on TV but stood her ground . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about the book, 'Nicky Buckley: A Memoir', she shared just how bad the criticism became. 'I was told I jammed fax machines at Channel 9 and newspapers - with faxes coming in from people commenting negatively.' 'At the time there wasn't any maternity wear except kaftans which covered you from head to toe, hiding your boobs and bump,' she said. Bitterness over bump: Buckley wore sexy dresses that revealed her bump, \u00a0shocking TV audiences, and hit back in magazine interviews saying she refused to bend to critics . TV Scandal: Nicky Buckley enraged public by staying on air throughout her nine month pregnancy . Family first: Buckley bucked preconceived notions of women in TV and continued to work to support family . As her role was to wear glamorous evening dresses and there wasn't adequate maternity wear available, she  just went up a size from her usual attire and got on with things. 'I wasn't out to raise the flag or cause a stir, I simply wanted to work \u2013 as was my right. Yet in doing so people had other opinions and thought I shouldn't be seen publicly with a bump.' 'I had a mortgage, people tend to forget  and put you in a bubble. But I still had a mortgage and do you think I should just stop and be taken off the air?' Game model: Game show host and model copped flack for her bump and continued to work to pay the bills . Glamorous to gritty: Despite her glamour role, Buckley says the pregnancy showed the ugly side to TV . 'I needed to pay the bills and I was happy with what's going on,' she said. 'Looking back I'm proud of how strong I was. I can't push the point hard enough, I was steadfast and strong, I was going to work and do my job.' 'I couldn't wait to share the news with my girlfriends but after the usual squeals of congratulations  they said \"what are you going to do about work?' she reflects in the book. A friend even made the shocking suggestion to Buckley that they could build her a podium to stand behind once she started to show. Host to husband: Buckley married her co-host Murray Bingham and subsequently had three children with him . While taken aback, she said she believes people saw her role as glamorous one and being pregnant clearly didn't fit with that image. 'Despite my blossoming belly and impending birth, unintentionally I had sparked a very public debate that divided a nation - was pregnancy  something to be ashamed of? Were pregnant women even attractive?  said Buckley. Not to mention the dress she wore on the runway at a Myer Fashion Festival that saw eyebrows raised. 'That caused a real stir. It was a dress with a cut out heart over the belly, people saw it outrageous but the designer and I thought it was beautiful and embraced the bump and fashion all at the same time.' Nearly 50 and fabulous: Buckley now at nearly 50 is celebrating her age with release of her memoir . The book: Buckley's memoir on sale now for $29.99 .",

The woman, named only as Ms Zhao, lives in a house bursting with frozen dishes and snacks. Husband Yin Yunfeng spent the last week of his annual holiday making all sorts of stir-fried dishes as well as about 1,000 dumplings as a way to show his love to his wife, according to thePeople's Daily Online. Treasure chest: Ms Zhao has enough food to last for a year prepared by her husband . Feast: The husband, Yin Yunfeng, spent a week cooking all sorts of stir-fried dishes . All-you-can-eat: He also made about 1,000 dumplings before returning to his regiment in Tibet . The devoted husband is worried that his wife would be eating instant noodles all the time so he cooked different types of dishes and put them into small foam containers to be frozen. Ms Shao said she is extremely busy with work and only has fresh meals when her husband is home. But now all she needs to do is to reheat the food in the microwave. Mr Yin is stationed in a regiment in Tibet and only gets to go home - which is some 2,700 kilometres away in southern China - once a year. 'Although I mentally prepared myself for this life when I married him, I had no idea it would be so tough,' sais Ms Zhao. 'At the end of every holiday I would be devastated and would cry all day but I will continue to support him in his career and look after this family.' She added: 'The food he prepared is enough for me for one year and every time I think of this my heart is warm.' In addition to meals, Mr Yin has also bought a large amount of snacks and hid them in different corners of the house as daily surprises to his wife.

'Today you have been studying very hard and I have a reward for you. Behind the sofa on the right there is a gap and I have left you a packet of raisins,' reads one of the messages. The snacks include chips, pumpkin seeds, chewing gum, biscuits, beef jerky and instant noodles. Yin said he hoped he would be home by the time his wife finishes the food and snacks.",

Competitive eater Mary Schuyler accomplished the stunning feat in front of hundreds at the Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday. Schuyler is such a champ that the four teams of two that competed against her didn't even come close to winning - even though they were allowed to split their dinners. Scroll down for video . Winner, winner, steak dinner: Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at the Big Texan Steack Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday . Fast eater: The 120-pound mother-of-four ate three steak dinners - complete with sides - in just 20 minutes . Worth it: For breaking the record for quickest steak dinner eaten and for finishing her three meals in under an hour, Schuyler took home a grand total of $6,000 . In addition to the three massive 72-ounce steaks, competitors also had to eat three baked potatoes, three shrimp cocktails, three salads and three rolls for a whopping 15 pounds of food. While that might sound daunting to most, Schuyler was confident that she would beat out the other competitors with her experience. 'They would have had to eat their half in like four minutes,' Schuyler told the Amarillo Globe-News. 'If you\u2019re not used to doing this, four minutes is hard.' Filling: The dinner included three 72-ounce steaks, three shrimp cocktails, three baked potatoes, three salads and three rolls . Champion: Though her competitors were allowed to tackle the challenge in teams of two, none came close to winning the competition . She cleaned her plate: Schuyler poses with a fan after the feat, showing off her belly bloated from the competition . However, she was a bit nervous about tackling a three steak dinners since she ate just two when she competed at the restaurant last year. 'I come in thinking I'm going to fail, but you know if I win it's a lovely parting gift and that's cool,' she told KFDA-TV. 'I also get free steak so I don't really lose.' As the competition began, Schuyler covered up with a pair of sunglasses and put up her sweatshirt hood to focus on the task at hand and finished her first steak in just four minutes and 18 seconds - beating the previous record she set last year of four minutes and 48 seconds. Hundreds cheered her on below the competition table set up side the restaurant on a sunny day, as Schuyler ripped her way through the steaks. Competitors had an hour to finish their $72 dinners, in order to get them for free, but Schuyler cleaned her plates in a cool 20. And with enough time to spare, Schuyler tried attacking a fourth steak but had to stop, saying she was tired of the taste. Schuyler was born and raised in Nebraska and currently residents in Sacramento California. Before her competitive food eating life, she worked as a bartender and server at Applebee\u2019s. In August 2012, Schuyler entered her first competitive eating competition, becoming the first woman to finish the Stellanator at Stella Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. The Stellanator includes six hamburger patties, six eggs, six pieces of cheese, six pieces of bacon topped with fried onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, two buns and mayonnaise. Another to add to the trophy cabinet: Schuyler pictured above winning the Z-Burger contest in Washington, DC last July. During the competition she ate 24 hamburgers in ten minutes . Since then, Schuyler has been competing regularly in food eating competitions - including one weekend in 2014 when she competed in FOUR food competitions. On January 31, 2014, Schuyler won Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia, by eating 363 wings. The next day, she competed in and won both the IHOP Pancake bowl and the bacon-eating contest at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines. She finished out the weekend by taking on the Adam Emmenecker Challenge at Jethro\u2019s Barbecue. Schuyler first took on the Emmenecker challenge in December 2012, when she became the first woman to complete the meal that includes a spicy pickle, bun, pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken tenders, white cheddar sauce, fried cheese cubes, Texas brisket, applewood smoked bacon, cheeseburger and a pound of waffle fries...in just 15 minutes. Dessert: Schuyler guzzles down\u00a012 pounds of rice pudding in three minutes to set a new world record last year . Hero: Last year Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland, Oregon . Schuyler started the competition at her normal 120 pounds, but by the time she was crowned winner, she had gained 15 pounds and her stomach noticeably filled out. Her physique was quite a contrast to the larger men who decided to take her on in the eating competition including a team of two professional wrestlers and two members of the Amarillo Venum indoor football team. For setting the record for fastest eaten steak dinner, Schuyler won $1,000 and another $5,000 for completing the challenge in less than an hour. What's more - Schuyler says she plans to come back next year and break her record, upping the ante to four steaks instead of three. Bobby Lee, the co-owner of the Big Texas, says the restaurant was floored by her performance and that they'll be submitting her record to Guinness. 'We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time- so this is a first for us and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal,' Lee told ABC 7. Schuyler started competing in eating competition in August 2012, and has broken several records during her brief career. In January 2014, she set ate 363 wings in just 20 minutes, earning $22,000 prize for that competition.",

The Red Devils have endured two mixed campaigns following the retirement of legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson in May 2013. After finishing seventh last season, their lowest position since in the Premier League era, United currently sit third in the table this term - 11 points behind leaders Chelsea. Manchester United winger Ashley Young believes the club will be challenging for the title next season . Despite their large deficit to the Blues, current United boss Louis van Gaal has restored some of the club's old vigour under Ferguson that was lost during David Moyes' ill-fated reign. Prior to their 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on April 18, the Old Trafford outfit had reeled off six successive league victories - including impressive triumphs over top four rivals Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. And Young believes that after a slow start under Van Gaal the fruits of his labour are finally paying off at United - which will see the club compete for their first league title in three seasons, next year. 'You don't manage the team he has managed without having that big, bold personality. He wants to be successful. He wants every detail spot on,' Young said about the 63-year-old in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. The 29-year-old (right) has played a prominent role for United this season under Louis van Gaal . 'As players, you want to be challenged and that's exactly what he does; he challenges us every single day. It was always going to take time, but it is all starting to come together. 'If you look at the last run of games, even last week against Chelsea when on another day we would have scored two or three goals, we will definitely be back challenging for the title next season.' Young's United career has been revitalised under Van Gaal this season - with the 29-year-old playing a prominent role in the Dutchman's starting line-up. Young has praised Van Gaal's (right) managerial style and desire to bring back success to the club . The England international has combined brilliantly of late with Daley Blind and Maraoune Fellaini, down the left-hand side of the United team - something the former Aston Villa star admits he has relished. 'Thats's been brilliant, the three of us playing in those triangles and the same the other side with Antonio [Valencia], Ander [Herrera] and Juan [Mata],' Young added. 'There are some cool heads there, and a lot of players who are now playing with more composure, not scared to give each other the ball, or play it in tight spaces.' Young (front) also believes United are playing with more composure than they were at the start of the season .",

If you're roasting a joint this Sunday, remember that thyme and red wine make perfect partners and don't forget to scrape the roasting dish for juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. And when looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts that have a good marbling of fat. Research by Asda has found that rump, fillet and T-Bone are the most popular cuts of meat when eating out but when we cook at home the majority of us (55 per cent) rely on burgers or mince. The supermarket's study also showed a showing lack of beef knowledge in the under 35's, which was highlighted further by the extensive knowledge of their senior counterparts. One in four youngsters think pocket and Y-bone are cuts of beef, whereas only a mere 3 per cent of over 55s fell for the fake cuts. In addition, this age bracket correctly identified shin (78 per cent) and skirt (72 per cent) as cuts of beef widely available across the UK but for the younger folk, those figures more than halved. Over a quarter of under 35's avoid trying unusual cuts of beef because they assume it will be too expensive while 30 per cent admitted they had never been shown how to cook a cut of beef. A fifth of 18-34-year-olds also admitted they find larger cuts of beef daunting to cook. Although half of Brits in their 20s would happily choose rump steak on the menu at a restaurant, they lack the confidence or know-how to cook it at home and therefore rely on the staples of mince and burgers to feed their beefy cravings. Neil Moorcroft buying manager for beef at Asda said: 'It's probably fair to say our grandparent's generation are more likely to have been brought up on a varied diet of beef cuts depending on what was available from the local butcher. 'However busy lifestyles and a shift in family mealtimes has altered this over the years, which is why it's become easy to fall into the same old shopping and cooking routines. 'But it's never too late to experiment and beef up those cooking skills, so if you get stuck just ask for tips at your local butcher's counter'. 'Bigger cuts of meat can be daunting, but they have great versatility, value for money and are definitely worth getting to grips with.' Best for Roasting . Preparing a roast can be daunting, but the cuts below are always a safe bet for any Sunday roast. Sirloin . Topside . Top Rump . Fillet . Get your roast on: . 1. Allow it to reach room temperature before cooking. 2. On a medium to high hob heat, seal the beef joint in a large frying pan with a touch of oil ensuring all sides are sealed by turning the joint every two to three minutes. 3. Transfer to a oven roasting dish and seasoning with salt and pepper, place into a preheated oven (190c/fan 170c) and allow to cook for 20 minutes per 500g for a juicy medium cooked joint. 4. Remove meat from roasting tray and allow to rest on a plate in a warm area for 15-20 minutes before serving use the roasting dish and juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. 5. Thyme and red wine is a perfect partner for roast beef. Best for Grilling . When looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts which have a good marbling of fat and also a tender joint which doesn't need to be beaten or stewed in order to bring out the flavours. Go for: . Flank . Skirt . Sirloin . Ribeye bone-in . Become a grill master: . 1. If you've bought a cheaper cut such as flank or top blade then marinating these meats first (overnight if possible) will really help to tenderize them . 2. Use a red hot grill pan which sizzles when you add the steak and try not to push it around or turn it too quickly if you want to create those famous griddle marks . 3. Similarly to a roast, let the steaks rest for five minutes before eating to allow meat to relax and become more tender. Best for Stewing . These cuts of beef are often the most cost effective because they require that extra bit of love and care in the kitchen, but don't let the time put you off. The flavours are well worth the wait for a tasty bubbling stew. Brisket . Shoulder . Beef ribs . Shank . Stew your way to success: . 1. Low and slow is the key phrase here, so get yourself a heavy bottomed casserole pot or slow cooker, and plenty of stock to allow for a long slow cook . 2. Preparation is easy, any veg can simply been thrown in at the start and left to bubble away . 3. Four hours should result in tender chunks of beef ready to accompany sides such as mash, dumplings or Yorkshire puds .",

And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate\u00a0Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate\u00a0Alec Shelbrooke in\u00a0Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were\u00a0left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.",

The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for \u00a3130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out \u00a3130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget \u00a319.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of \u00a319.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, \u00a3130:\u00a0Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene\u00a0and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the\u00a0Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At \u00a3130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of \u00a3130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, \u00a319.99:\u00a0The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for \u00a314.99 in 2013. Aldi's \u00a319.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty.\u00a0But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas:\u00a0The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the\u00a0Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At \u00a319.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the \u00a3130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.",

The 39-year-old was on the ninth hole when he found himself 470 yards away from the pin with the ball nestled in pine straws. However when he followed through, the four-time champion at Augusta slammed the club into a root, causing him to wince and grab his hand in agony. It forced the joint out of place, but Woods shunned medical attention and simply pushed it back in himself. Tiger Woods looks in agony after his club came into contact with a tree root on the ninth hole at Augusta. He later revealed his wrist bone had 'popped out' of place . The 39-year-old is clearly in agony as he is forced to drop his club on the follow through . He then grabs his wrist and winces. After finishing his round he revealed that his wrist bone had popped out - so he was forced to put it back in . His reaction prompted concerns he may have suffered another injury setback. However he managed to shake off the scare and finish his round. Woods, playing in his 20th Masters tournament, ended up at 5-under-par on 283, tied for 17th. 'It hurts; it definitely hurts,' Woods said. 'I didn't know there was a tree root there. I drilled the club straight into it. It didn't move, but my body kept moving. 'There's a little joint that popped out, and I was able to somehow put it back in, which didn't feel very good. 'At least I got it back in; I could move my hand again. It's sore. I'm not going to be lifting any weights for a while.' He also admitted that he may not return to the course for a while. Despite finishing\u00a013 strokes behind 21-year-old winner Jordan Spieth, this was Woods' best finish in a tournament in over a year. Spieth became the youngest winner since Woods when he was given the coveted green jacket on Sunday. After his final putt he went an embraced his tearful childhood sweetheart Annie Verret. The Texan native, whose life-long dream has been to win the Masters, was undoubtedly being watched on television at home by his youngest sibling, Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Ellie has helped to keep Spieth grounded, according to their mother. Speaking after his win, Spieth said: 'It was very nerve-wracking today. I didn't sleep all last night. Just got out here and got in a little rhythm. With two major champions right behind, I couldn't let up. It was the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It was remarkable. He added: 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green there, and knew it was going to be a done deal. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit.' Spieth's victory comes a year after he lost a bid to become the youngest player to win the Masters. This year, he did not let anyone get closer to him than three shots following his record start. He closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set another record. The four-time Masters champion managed to shake off the injury to finish the competition at 5-under-par . 21-year-old Jordan Spieth (centre) celebrates his first Masters victory with his girlfriend Annie Verret on Sunday .

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called \"Bali Nine.\" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, \"don't judge me too harshly.\"  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  \"A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, \"The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options.\" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the \"extensive rehabilitation\" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to \"use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.\"",

Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when\u00a0he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably\u00a0not his either. Instead, it records the\u00a0date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny'\u00a0Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return\u00a0the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'",

Hawking has partnered with the silly lads of Monty Python to recreate the signature \"Galaxy Song\" from their 1983 film \"The Meaning of Life.\" The collabo is in honor of Saturday's Record Store Day, when the 7-inch single will be available for sale. The accompanying video is guaranteed to be the most awesome thing you see today. In it, fellow scientist Brian Cox rails against the inaccuracies in \"Galaxy Song\" when a fed-up Hawking, who has ALS, zooms up in his wheelchair and knocks over Cox. Hawking continues singing the song in his signature computerized voice. Hawking then launches into the stratosphere for a trippy ride and lesson on the cosmos. The scene is derived from a filmed bit that Monty Python uses during its live shows. 40 years of 'Holy Grail': The best of Monty Python . \"Galaxy Song\" song was written by Python member Eric Idle, along with John Du Prez, and is \"an intricate and informative lecture on the enor-mity of the Universe fashioned into a bewitching and, above all, highly amusing pop song,\" according to the comedy troupe's site. Hawking's version is available for download. It's not Hawking's first music gig; he's also featured on the Pink Floyd song \"Talkin' Hawkin.'\" The original version of \"Galaxy Song\" is below.

The secret document, which has the exact GPS co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the MoD's website. The details could be used as 'an invasion guide' by Argentina, with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any Argentine bombers sent to attack the islands. The Falklands Islands are defended by a squadron of RAF Typhoon aircraft operating from Mount Pleasant aerodrome on West Falkland, supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area . The aerodrome also operates as a Search and Rescue location with Sea King helicopters, pictured . The airstrip, pictured, is home to four Europfighter Typhoon aircraft tasked with defending the islands . The Aerodrome Manual was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the MoD's website and could have been downloaded by Argentine intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands. A senior military source told The Express: 'This is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get. 'It's practically an invasion handbook.\u00a0Taking out the runway could cripple Britain's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute.' The MoD admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled. They denied the information was particularly sensitive. The blunder occurred as Argentina was described as a 'very live threat' by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. This comes as Argentina is preparing to lease 12 Sukhoi SU-24 long-range bombers from Russia. The Falklands Islands are defended by modern Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, supported by Rapier surface-to-air missiles and 1,200 troops. The Royal Navy also patrols the area and nuclear-powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region. And the MoD recently announced the \u00a3228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences. The jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from Argentina in the event of a new conflict . Argentina is considering leasing 12 Suhkoi SU-24 bombers, pictured, from Russia. The Cold War-era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb Mount Pleasant without the need to refuel . The MoD published the Aerodrome Manual on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone . The Cold War-era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the Falklands Islands and return to Argentina without the need to refuel. It also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air-to-air missiles. The jets, despite being designed in the 1960s, are also capable of supersonic travel. This comes as tensions between Britain and Argentina have increased over plans by UK firms to drill for oil in the South Atlantic. Argentina's minister for the Malivinas - the name it uses for the Falklands Islands - Daniel Filmus threatened to prosecute any British firms exploring for oil near the islands. He said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the Falklands Islands' continental shelf, which we reject, and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities. 'We are satisfied that the Islands have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies, and will continue to support them as they move forward. Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Police in India are putting aside their batons in favor of an overhead solution to angry and unruly crowds: pepper-spraying drones. Yashasvi Yadav, Senior Superintendent of police in Lucknow, northern India, told CNN the city's force has bought four drones and is in the process of purchasing one more. \"The drones have been tested in controlled conditions,\" he said. \"They have been very successful and will be used by the Lucknow police whenever there are violent protests or mob attacks.\" The miniature aircraft will be fitted with a camera and pepper spray; each drone costs between $9,560 and $19,300, Yadav added. Views on the new measure are mixed, with some concerned about the suppression of freedom of speech -- an already contentious issue in India. Last month, the country failed to enforce a law that would allow authorities to arrest people who post offensive material on social media. Others believe the country could learn from events further afield. Some say this method of crowd control needs regulation too. Questions have also been raised as to why the police are resorting to aggression. \"While I think it is bound to fail if not be another scam in the making, it also shows the mindset of the administration to not use dialogue and mediation to solve problems but use authoritarian and forceful methods,\" photojournalist Chirag Wakaskar in Mumbai told CNN. \"What they could do is start by having video surveillance in sensitive areas and have swifter justice.\" Protests are a common occurrence in India, a country with a population of 1.2 billion; Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, also used drone cameras to monitor crowds at a recent religious festival. As well as being used as a security measure in other cities including Delhi and Mumbai, the unmanned, airborne vehicles have been used in tiger hunts, disaster relief and criminal investigations -- and even pizza deliveries. Reports suggest that the drone surveillance will be officially launched by the Chief Minister of Lucknow, Akhilesh Yadav, later this month. Kunal Sehgal contributed to this report.",

A single father of four was crowned MasterChef champion last night, fulfilling a dream to become a chef that he has nurtured since he was eight. Simon Wood, 38, battled it out against Emma Spitzer and Tony Rodd as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours. The final followed seven weeks of tough challenges, including the 'chef's table', which involved cooking one of three courses on a menu set up by Italian chef Massimo Bottura. It brings to an end the eleventh series of the popular BBC weekly amateur cooking contest. Mr Wood, a data manager from Oldham in Greater Manchester, served a starter of octopus with chorizo and cannellini beans followed by a main of squab pigeon served two ways with blackberry sauce, watercress puree and carrots. He finished with a dessert of lemon posset topped with seven garnishes \u2013 citrus tutti-frutti, charred grapefruit and orange, a lime tuile, limoncello pistachio crumb, edible flowers, tarragon leaves and a lime air. After he presented the dishes to the judges, Torode said: 'Do you know why I love you? Because you take something quite ordinary and make it special.' Wallace said: 'Simon is brilliant, he's an incredible talent.' After being crowned the winner, Mr Wood said: 'I'm shaking inside, it's so surreal, I can't begin to describe how happy I am. It's life changing.' Finalist Mr Rodd, 33, is an architectural recruitment consultant from London, while Miss Spitzer is the managing director of a luxury travel business and mother to four daughters under nine. Finalists: Simon Wood, 38, right, battled it out against Emma Spitzer, left, and Tony Rodd, centre, as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours . Mr Wood said: 'I have been cooking since I could reach the top of the oven, and I always cooked at weekends with my grandma. 'When I was eight I won a competition where the prize was to have your dream job for the day and mine was to be a chef. Thirty years later who would have thought I would have the MasterChef trophy in my hands.' Momentous: Kim Woodward is the first woman to be appointed head chef at the Savoy Grill . A former MasterChef semi-finalist has become the first woman to run the prestigious Savoy Grill kitchen in its 126-year history. Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at the famous venue, which has hosted lunches for the likes of prime ministers, musicians and captains of industry for decades. The 34-year-old follows in the footsteps of a string of ma\u00eetre chefs who have headed the kitchen since its opening in the Strand, London in 1889. Ms Woodward, who lives in Camden, said: \u2018It is an absolute honour for me to be the head chef here in one of London\u2019s most iconic restaurants. Obviously there is so much history here, and the people who come through the door come here for the classic dishes that the Grill is famous for.\u2019 At the five-star, art deco Grill, which is now part of the Gordon Ramsay stable, Woodward will head a team of about 35 chefs, of whom some 40 per cent are women. It marks her return to the venue \u2014 she was a sous chef between 2010 and 2012, before becoming head chef at the York & Albany gastropub in Camden. She reached the semi-final of the 2011 series of MasterChef: The Professionals.",

Council inspectors found a shocking state of hygiene at The Steer Inn in Wilberfoss, East Yorkshire - and owner David Crossfield later admitted 17 charges of breaching food safety regulations. Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date. Shocking:\u00a0Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy (above) and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date . In addition, raw meat was being prepared in direct contact with ready to eat salad items posing a serious risk of cross contamination, Beverley Magistrates\u2019 Court was told. Inspectors - who first visited in January 2014 - also found kitchen equipment was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair, and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning. Meanwhile food safety systems, monitoring checks and procedures were not in place - and food handlers were found to consistently demonstrate a lack of understanding of food safety issues. Crossfield, 52, of Elvington, North Yorkshire - whom magistrates branded \u2018foolish\u2019 - also admitted failing to comply with a hygiene improvement notice requiring food hygiene training for his staff. Mouldy food and dirty floor: Inspectors found kitchen equipment at The Steer Inn was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning . Crossfield said he was the sole director of The Steer Inn (Pocklington) Ltd and had admitted he had taken over the running of the premises with no knowledge of running a kitchen or a restaurant. He said he had been worked in pubs and bars \u2018with no problems before\u2019 and he had been \u2018naive\u2019 and had been led to believe the chef had the right qualifications relating to food hygiene. Crossfield told the court that The Steer Inn had ceased trading on New Year\u2019s Eve 2014 and that he was in the process of liquidating the company, which had no assets. Chair of the bench Graham McDonald told him: \u2018These were appalling offences.\u00a0People could have become seriously ill or even died as a result of salmonella. East Yorkshire restaurant:\u00a0The company was fined \u00a38,500, plus costs of \u00a31,392 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120.

Crossfield was individually fined \u00a32,750, as well as costs of \u00a31,392 and a \u00a3120 victim surcharge. Paul Abbott, manager for public protection at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said: \u2018The council\u2019s food safety team had offered considerable advice to the food business operator of the premises in an attempt to produce safe food but despite being rated a zero under the food hygiene rating scheme, he had failed to make meaningful improvements.

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'",

Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that \"Doe 3\" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a \"sex slave\" and made \"her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people.\" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, \"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case \"is all about money\" and \"completely made up.\" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said \"lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably.\" \"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,\" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report.",

As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a \u00a31million house in Islington, London . In reality she has been one of the country\u2019s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an \u2018urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur\u2019, bought a large terrace house in Islington for \u00a3440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than \u00a31million in value. Promise: David Cameron and the Conservatives plan to extend \u2018right to buy\u2019 from council houses to housing association properties if they win . Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend \u2018right to buy\u2019 legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to \u2018some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents\u2019. She added: \u2018We are independent organisations and charities \u2013 you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they\u2019re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. ' So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.\u2019 Miss Davison\u2019s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: \u2018The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many \u2013 I couldn\u2019t afford to buy my home now. \u2018We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.\u2019",

HIV specialists and network security experts at University College London (UCL) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads . They worked together to build a model for this 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off AIDS. Scroll down for video . Researchers creates a model 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say the spread was similar to a computer virus . HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. The teams noticed that the spread of HIV through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. Lead author Changwang Zhang, of UCL, said: 'HIV and Conficker have a lot in common. 'They both use hybrid spreading mechanisms, persist for a very long time and are incredibly difficult to eradicate. 'Our model enables us to explain these important properties and to predict the infection process.' Changwang's supervisor co-author Dr Shi Zhou said: 'Although the cybersecurity community organised an unprecedented collaboration to tackle Conficker, they still failed to eliminate Conficker from the Internet. 'HIV researchers face a similar problem. We hope that our new understanding of hybrid epidemics will help us to fight against Conficker and HIV.' Detailed sample data from 17 HIV patients from London were used to verify the model, showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for HIV progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment. HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. Co-senior author Professor Benny Chain, of UCL, said: 'The number of HIV cells in the bloodstream is always relatively low, and our model shows that HIV spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause AIDS. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. 'It is likely that when HIV gains a foothold somewhere with a high T-cell population, such as the gut, it uses a cell-to-cell transfer mechanism to efficiently spread directly between them. As such, if HIV has already spread to an area rich in T-cells by the time treatment begins, preventing its spread through the bloodstream will not stop AIDS. 'Our model suggests that completely blocking cell-to-cell transfer would prevent progression to AIDS, highlighting the need to develop new treatments.' Laboratory research, led by co-senior author Dr Clare Jolly, has previously shown that some drugs are better than others at stopping HIV from spreading directly between cells. However, it's not possible to directly measure cell-to-cell spread in patients because it takes place inside internal organs. Dr Jolly said: 'With this new model, we should be able to assess the effectiveness of drugs against different modes of HIV spread in real patients. 'This could prove invaluable when interpreting the results of drug trials to understand what works and why. Using computer models to understand processes that we cannot directly observe is common in the physical sciences and supports many fundamental theories. 'Our model provides strong evidence that cell-to-cell spread is an important part of HIV spread, and we hope to show this directly in future animal studies.'.",

Three other guards - Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard - were each sentenced to 30 years and one day in prison for charges that included manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and using firearms while committing a felony. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth announced the sentences after a day-long hearing at which defense lawyers had argued for leniency, and prosecutors asked that those sentences - the minimums mandatory under the law - be made even harsher. Scroll down for video . FILE - In these various file photos, Blackwater guards, from left, Dustin Heard, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Nicholas Slatten. A years-long legal fight over a deadly mass shooting of civilians in an Iraq war zone reaches its reckoning point, when four former Blackwater security guards are sentenced for the rampage. Three of the guards, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty and Paul Slough, face mandatory decades-long sentences because of firearms convictions. A fourth, Nicholas Slatten, faces a penalty of life in prison after being found guilty of first-degree murder. (AP Photo/File) Sentencing: Former Blackwater guard Nicholas Slatten (bottom right) was convicted of first degree murder and on Monday be sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 2007 Nisour Square slaughter that left 14 dead and dozens more maimed and injured.\u00a0Dustin Heard, Paul Slough and Evan Liberty (clockwise from top left) were received the 30-year minimum sentences plus one day for their multiple manslaughter convictions . U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth on Monday rejected a defense motion to impose lesser sentences on the four, as well as a motion by prosecutors to increase the penalties. Lamberth deferred formally imposing the sentences while hearing arguments from both sides on the sentencing. Defense lawyers argued for mercy but prosecutors said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility. All four were convicted in October for their involvement in the killings that caused an international uproar in Nisoor Square, a crowded traffic circle in downtown Baghdad. The legal fight over the killings has spanned years. Prosecutors have described the shooting as an unprovoked ambush of civilians, though defense lawyers countered that the men were targeted with gunfire, and shot back in self-defense. Dozens of Iraqi witnesses to the bloody September day in Baghdad volunteered to travel to Washington to testify against the former guards, the New York Times reported. They described to jurors a scene of absolute horror, one that came as if out of the clear blue. They said they took cover after hearing machine-gun fire start ring after four American armored vehicles rolled into busy Nisour Square. A traffic officer who was on the scene described watching a woman cradle her dead son in her arms before she, too, was murdered by Blackwater guards. Mandatory minimums: A man caring a poster that reads 'approximate locations of victims around Nisoor Square' enters the E.

Former co-workers: Former Blackwater security guards stand in line to enter the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse in Washington in support of the men awaiting sentencing . \u2018There was a lady. She was screaming and weeping about her son and asking for help,\u2019 Sarhan Deab Abdul Moniem said through an interpreter. \u2018I asked her to open up the door so I could help her. But she was paying attention only to her son.\u2019 Majed Salman Abdel Kareem al-Gharbawi, 55, described being shot in the gut and slumping to the ground alongside another wounded man. \u2018He was screaming and praying to god, for Allah to save him from this calamity,\u2019 Gharbawi testified. \u2018So I told him, let\u2019s do that together.\u2019 Gharbawi stayed down as the other man decided to make a run for it\u2014a decision that cost the man his life. \u2018His body was shaking violently as the bullets were piercing him and hitting the sidewalk,\u2019 Gharbawi said. According to the Times, the Blackwater guards continued shooting into the man\u2019s body well after he was clearly dead. The defense argued for mercy Monday by saying that decades-long sentences would be unconstitutionally harsh punishments for men who operated in a stressful, war-torn environment, and who have proud military careers and close family ties. The firearms convictions alone carry mandatory minimum sentences of 30 years in prison. The government sought sentences far beyond that, partly because it said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility. Bloodbath: an Iraqi woman peeps inside the blood stained car of two women allegedly shot dead by private security guards in central Baghdad. Dozens of Iraqi witnesses would later volunteer to testify about the atrocities they saw that day . Murdered: A picture shows the blood stained and bullet riddled car of two women allegedly shot dead by Blackwater guards. One witness would later describe watching a woman cradle her dead, bullet-riddled son before she was murdered at his side . Unimaginable: Hair is seen on the bullet riddled and blood stained windshield of a car of two women shot dead. One witness said he watched a man bolt for his life only to be riddled with bullets before guards continued to fire at his clearly dead body . The sentencing is unlikely to bring an end to the legal wrangling, which began even before the guards were first charged in 2008. A judge later dismissed the case before trial, but a federal appeals court revived it and the guards were indicted again in October 2013. Even before the trial began, defense lawyers had identified multiple issues as likely forming the basis of an appeal, including whether there was proper legal jurisdiction to charge them in the first place. The statute under which they were charged, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, covers the overseas crimes of Defense Department civilian employees, military contractors and others who are supporting the American war mission. But defense lawyers note that the Blackwater defendants worked as State Department contractors and were in Iraq to provide diplomatic, not military, services. The legal fighting continued in the days leading up to sentencing, too, with defense lawyers seeking Friday to postpone the hearing after receiving new information \u2014 a victim impact statement from a trial witness \u2014 that they said was favorable to the defense. But Lamberth denied the request, saying there was no need to delay the sentencing. Wartorn: The defense argued for mercy Monday by saying that decades-long sentences would be unconstitutionally harsh punishments for men who operated in a stressful, war-torn environment .

Other users alluded to the creature being impacted by pollution, with Shenzhen Reservoir being recently deluged with toxic sewerage that turned parts of the region blood red. Some claimed it was in fact a Malaysian Bear who was suffering from alopecia, a disease which causes baldness. The description for the unsettling video claims it was captured in the Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay after local workers found the animal swimming . The video has been the subject of heated online debates over the species of the animal, with some users claiming it is a mythical 'water monster' and others that it's a diseased Malaysian Bear . A similar video surfaced in January of an ailing sun bear in Borneo island in Malaysia, which had been beaten by local plantation workers and driven into the bush. It was reported this month that the animal was discovered at another nearby plantation, where it is being nursed back to health. David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia the caged animal 'looks like a bear cub which is suffering from some medical condition which has caused it to loose all of its fur.' While he was unable to confirm if it was the same bear from the Borneo clip, he said he suspects it is and that the footage originates from Borneo not China. A heavily-polluted field in\u00a0Shenzhen Reservoir, where the mystery beats was apparently captured, has fuelled accusations the animal may have been contaminated . Internet users have also claimed the animal in the clip is a Malaysian sun bear (pictured) which is suffering from\u00a0alopecia, a disease which causes baldness .",

Brisbane locals were left scratching their heads after the mysterious message 'I'm sorry' followed by a love heart and two crosses for kisses was splashed across the city's clear blue sky on Monday afternoon. The aerial apology hovered above the CBD at about 1pm, prompting several people to jump onto social media to question and voice their theories about who had done what. One desperate man has forked out nearly $4000 for a written message in the sky in a bid to seek forgiveness . The aerial apology was followed by a love heart and two crosses for kisses on Monday afternoon . Jordan Miller tweeted on Twitter: 'I'm not sure what he did but that's a big apology!! Lucky he screwed up on a clear day! What if it were overcast?' He followed with another tweet: 'Men of Brisbane. If you've screwed up in the last 24 hrs have your partner look at the sky right now. You're welcome.' ABC reporter Kathy McLeish posted: 'Giant sky-writing apology over Brisbane CBD... Must have been bad..' While the author and recipient remain a mystery, the creation behind the message was Rob Vance, of Skywriting Services Australia,\u00a0who took just 10 minutes to complete the urgent appeal. 'I'm not sure what he did but that's a big apology!! Lucky he screwed up on a clear day! What if it were overcast?' Jordan Miller tweeted . Locals quickly took to Twitter to question who the mysterious message was directed at . People have jumped to conclusion, believing the man must have done something terribly bad . An ABC reporter also took to Twitter, considering the apology was trying to make up for something bad . But the man who requested it didn't appear to be frantically lovelorn, he said. 'No, he was calm, cool and collected,' Mr Vance told AAP. While you can't put a price on love, Mr Vance said the service usually charged $3990 for up to 10 letters or characters. Interestingly, it's not the first time Mr Vance has made a profit from someone screwing up. 'It's usually along the same lines - someone saying sorry and that's basically it,' he said. ''I'm sorry Barbara' or something like that.' The author and recipient of Monday's message remain a mystery.",

Officers had surrounded the mother and blocked her off with cardboard boxes in a bid to give her some privacy in the busy hallways. McCartney said people started cheering when they realized a baby had been born.

They were then taken to hospital, where Malachi met his dad, Nom, and two older siblings, who were grateful for the officers' actions. 'I do want to thank them for stepping in and stealing my shine,' Nom joked with KABC. 'No. Thank you. I'm glad he's here. He's healthy. We're happy. Everything's good.'

MailSport looks at the reasons why Atletico Madrid\u2019s meeting with Real Madrid can also lay claim to be the greatest city derby in world football. Opposites attract . The clash of styles is always fascinating. Carlo Ancelotti must accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema and that leaves him little choice but to play a 4-3-3. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema must all be accommodated, leaving little choice but 4-3-3 . Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are meeting for the fifth and sixth time in European competition that brings them level with Inter and AC Milan in number of city duels. Chelsea and Arsenal have met twice, as have Barcelona and Espanyol and Rapid and Steaua Bucharest. It\u2019s a system that leaves Real Madrid short in midfield especially when you consider none of the first choice midfield trio are defensive players. This plays perfectly into Atletico\u2019s hands. Diego Simeone will flood the midfield on Tuesday night as he has done in recent meetings between the two sides and see if his 4-4-2 with Arda Turan, Mario Suarez, Gabi and Koke can\u2019t over-run Rodriguez, Luka Modric in midfield. Atletico\u2019s two banks of four are also very good at closing the space down for Bale, Ronaldo and Benzema. No wonder Ancelotti said on Monday that playing Simeone\u2019s team is always a problem. Midfielder Koke will be deployed to try and smother the Real Madrid midfield during their last eight tie . The coaches . Simeone never tires of his \u2018one game at a time mantra\u2019 Ancelotti was on Monday talking about the challenge being not to beat Atletico but to win the 11th European Cup \u2013 the complete opposite of one game at a time. This meeting has added spice because it's the chance for last season's beaten finalists to avenge their victors. Borusia Monchengladbach had the same opportunity against Liverpool in 1978 as did Juventus against Ajax in 1997 and Inter Milan against Bayern Munich in 2011. Simeone\u2019s burns more calories on the touchline than some of his players while Ancelotti\u2019s activity tends to get no more anaerobic than opening another packet of chewing gum. The Italian has won the lot in club football, Simeone is on his way to equaling that feat \u2013 he has already won the league and cup in Spain, and the European and Spanish Super Cups along with the Europa League. He almost got the European Cup last year but Ancelotti denied him. For as long as the pair stay in Spain their futures will be linked. Diego Simeone raises his players one game at a time and the games against Real Madrid are no difference . Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti and Atletico boss Simeone often have their careers compared . The Real stars against the team with no stars . When Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico Madrid in the league in February it wasn\u2019t the Atletico players who went out partying. Real\u2019s players are the footballing glitterati and Ronaldo\u2019s high-profile birthday bash was part of that. Atletico\u2019s players take great joy in beating their pin-up rivals. Mario Mandzukic, Diego Godin and Raul Garcia are happy to play it ugly if it gets results. Diego Godin and Mario Mandzukic are happy to play ugly to achieve winning results for their side . Goals and golazos . Koke\u2019s thunderbolt shots, the inspiration of Turan, a moment\u2019s magic from Antoine Griezmann \u2013 Atletico Madrid are about more than just graft. And with Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema, James Rodriguez and Isco all capable of moments of brilliance the derbies have thrown up their fair share of great goals. Ronaldo and Gareth Bale's moments of brilliance have thrown up their fair share of goals in the game . Atletico Madrid's Turkish midfielder Arda Turan has scored his fair share of wondergoals in his career . Well-matched . They used to hold a sarcastic banner up behind the goal at the Santiago Bernabeu for the Madrid derby. It was written like a classified ad and read: \u2018wanted \u2013 decent rival for city derby\u2019. Those days are long gone. Atletico Madrid ended a 14-year run of not beating Real when they won the Copa del Rey against them two years ago. Sergio Ramos celebrates a goal against his rivals in the Champions League final in Portugal . The game is a chance for Simeone to get his own back on Ancelotti for the defeat in what is to date their only meeting in European competition. Although some would say with four wins and two draws in the six games in other competitions between the two since then, he has already done that. And they haven\u2019t looked back since. At the start of the season they beat them in the Spanish Super Cup and knocked them out of the Copa del Rey both times over two legs. The one blip in the recent run came when it mattered most in last year\u2019s Champions League final and they will hope to put that right on Tuesday night. Most City derbies have one side up and the other down \u2013 right now Atletico as Spanish Champions and Real as European Champions are a match for each other in every sense. Bale celebrates when it counts most as he scores in the Champions League final in Portugal in 2014 .",

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'",

Nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on May 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s. Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservatives, narrowly topped the polls assessing who 'won' the two-hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for Britain. Crucially, 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed Cameron as 'the most impressive' on the subject of the economy, which lies at the heart of each party's campaign. But pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be Cameron or the Labour Party's Ed Miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast. Scroll down for video . The build-up: Prime Minister David Cameron went head-to-head with six other party leaders in a TV debate on Thursday night in an unusual format for Britain. It comes six weeks ahead of the general election on May 7 . Neck-and-neck: Cameron was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out Miliband (right) Nicola Sturgeon, of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate, which also featured the environment-focused Green Party, led by Natalie Bennett, and Wales' Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party completed the line-up. Analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a 'killer line' that would set them apart from the other participants. 'There was clearly no knock-out blow,' said Peter Kellner of pollster YouGov. Jonny Tudor, 17, who asked one of the questions on the night, said afterwards: 'Some performed well in answer to certain questions, other performed well on different subjects, but there was no definitive winner.' A rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted Cameron to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets. Too close to call? Pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the Labour Party's Ed Miliband (left) or David Cameron (right) in the top job after votes are cast. But polls named Cameron as last night's debate 'winner' Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . Rare moment of drama: A woman stood up during the debate to heckle Cameron about homelessness . But in a result that will calm Conservative nerves, a Comres/ITV poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged Cameron was the most capable of leading Britain, compared to 28 per cent who named Miliband. The event was the first and only full TV debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters, many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy. It is the only time Cameron and Miliband will go head-to-head on issues of policy before votes are cast. In one of Cameron's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance, he pointed to his rivals, one-by-one, and said: 'What I'm hearing is more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes, some more debt and more taxes, and definitely more debt and more taxes.'

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nArsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if \u00a330million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer . Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November . Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal \u00a330m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 . Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career . But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over \u00a330m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year . He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September . The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season . Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season . Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters .",

The coat of an English bulldog, the ears of a King Charles spaniel and the tail of an Irish setter help make up a set of ideal characteristics voted for by 2,000 pet owners. The perfect dog also has the body size of a border collie, the snout of a labrador and the eyes of a beagle. Scroll down for video . The dog has all the best bits from the UK's favourite breeds, the hair of an English Bulldog and a Labrador nose . The research found more than a third of owners wanted their dog to have a short, low-maintenance coat, while a similar proportion favoured soft, floppy ears. Almost half said their ideal dog would be \u2018standard-sized\u2019 like a collie, compared with 36 per cent who preferred smaller lap dogs such as chihuahuas. The \u2018soft and round\u2019 snout of a labrador was the most favourable nose, with 50 per cent of the vote, beating the elongated snout of a collie which was chosen by 24 per cent. When it came to naming their pets, 29 per cent of owners said they opted for \u2018human\u2019 choices such as Dave or Lucy.

But slightly more \u2013 33 per cent \u2013 preferred traditional dogs\u2019 names including Rover and Bailey. The survey, by flea treatment brand Frontline Spot On, also found that people favoured different types of dog depending on where they lived. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 41 per cent of Londoners preferred small dogs who don\u2019t take up much room. Meanwhile almost a fifth of owners in East Anglia, with its swathes of countryside, picked the large great dane as their favourite breed. Our 'perfect dog' has the body of a Border Collie (right) but the Great Dane was most popular in East Anglia . Voters in different areas preferred their dogs larger or smaller, depending on the region where they lived . Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) rather than a retriever-sized pooch (34 per cent). Meanwhile, those in East Anglia prefer Great Danes (19 per cent) over tiny dogs like Chihuahuas (4 per cent). A quarter of owners valued their pet\u2019s companionship so much they said the perfect dog would live for as long as they did \u2013 instead of the normal lifespan of around ten to 13 years. The survey also asked about the ideal dog\u2019s sound, with 30 per cent opting for the \u2018mid-range\u2019 bark of a labrador as opposed to a high-pitched yap. Brock Abreu, Frontline Spot On brand manager, said: \u2018When it comes to our ideal canine companion, looks really do matter. \u2018It is also great to see that we are being patriotic and championing those traditional and beautiful British dog breeds.\u2019 Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) than a larger retreiver .",

The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either \u2018incredibly naive or totally incompetent\u2019 by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank\u2019s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for \u2018a further one-year period\u2019 before leaving the bank\u2019s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that \u2018no decision has been taken at this time\u2019. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: \u2018You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.\u2019 Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC\u2019s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax. The bank was subsequently fined \u00a31.2 billion for breaching American money-laundering laws. Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than \u00a3500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC\u2019s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC\u2019s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that \u2018frontline\u2019 staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank\u2019s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: \u2018We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.\u2019 But Mrs Hodge responded that to \u2018simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose\u2019. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role\u00a0over her HSBC role . Her likely departure from HSBC comes as the bank is planning for a wider clearout of non-executives who have been on the board for a long period of time.",

Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says. 'There is a kind of a firefighter buried inside the politician still and he tends to barge into burning buildings if his friends are in there.'

Ms McGregor, now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm.

But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.' The ABC did however report that she said: 'He's not a supporter of gay marriage, I'm sad about that.'",

Judge John Koeltl said in a decision made public Tuesday that the incendiary ad is speech protected under the First Amendment. He said he was sensitive to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's claim that the poster could incite violence and appreciates the efforts necessary to prevent violent attacks targeting Jewish people. AFDI 1, MTA 0: A federal judge has ordered the\u00a0Metropolitan Transportation Authority to run on its buses anti-Islam ads featuring the phrase 'Killing Jews is Worship' created by the pro-Israel lobby\u00a0American Freedom Defense Initiative . But he noted that substantially the same advertisement ran in San Francisco and Chicago in 2013 without incident. He added that examples of violent attacks cited by the MTA show that individuals may commit heinous acts without warning. Koeltl also noted that the MTA and Chairman Thomas Prendergast 'underestimate the tolerant quality of New Yorkers and overestimate the potential impact of these fleeting advertisements.' 'Under the First Amendment, the fear of such spontaneous attacks, without more, cannot override individuals' rights to freedom of expression,' Koeltl said in a ruling dated Monday. He delayed enforcing his order to run the ads by a month so it can be appealed. MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg said the agency is disappointed in the ruling and is preparing a response. It came in a lawsuit filed last year by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, an organization headed by firebrand blogger Pamela Geller that's behind the advertisement. David Yerushalmi, a lawyer for the organization, said the decision 'sends a strong message both to government bureaucrats who would restrict our freedom of speech based upon what they perceive to be a global jihadist threat, and it also sends a telling message to our enemies abroad and at home: Their threats of violence will not prevent the courts from upholding the First Amendment.' The lawsuit said Geller's group buys the advertisements to express its message on current events and public issues 'including issues such as Islam's hatred of Jews.' An ad from the pro-Israel American Freedom Defense Initiative is seen on an articulated Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) bus featuring a 1941 photograph of Hitler and supporter Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a Palestinian Arab nationalist, Wednesday, April 1, 2015, in Philadelphia . The lawsuit was filed after the MTA notified the group in August that it would display three of four proposed posters but not an ad with the quote 'Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah' because it could incite violence. In the ad, a man's menacing face wrapped with a checkered scarf is shown next to the quote, which is attributed to \"Hamas MTV.\" It is followed by the words: 'That's his Jihad. What's yours?' It also includes a disclaimer that the ad's display does not imply the MTA's endorsement of its views. The MTA, whose buses and subways have been forums for policy debates, has accepted other ads from the American Freedom Defense Initiative. In September 2012, subway stations in New York featured AFDI posters that read: 'In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.' Two years later, Pamela Geller's group agreed to pull an ad from the subway system showing captive journalist James Foley with the masked militant who decapitated him in the moment before the beheading. In a September statement, the MTA said it recognized that the 'Killing Jews' ad was a parody of 'MyJihad' ads sponsored by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which said it was promoting the concept that jihad is an individual and personal struggle rather than a violent conflict or terrorism. Koeltl said he recognized that the MTA believes it would be far more difficult to counter the advertisement because it has parodic aspects. Past ads:\u00a0A man stands next to ad in the New York Subway saying: 'In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad' in New York on September 24, 2012 . But he said he believes the agency underestimates 'the power of counter-advertisements to explain that the MTA does not endorse the ad and that the ad is not to be taken seriously.' Monica Klein, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, noted in a statement that the mayor has said 'these anti-Islamic ads are outrageous, inflammatory and wrong, and have no place in New York City, or anywhere.' 'These hateful messages serve only to divide and stigmatize when we should be coming together as one city,' she added. 'While those behind these ads only display their irresponsible intolerance, the rest of us who may be forced to view them can take comfort in the knowledge that we share a better, loftier and nobler view of humanity.'

In a documentary aired today  on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying. Putin also expressed his fears that the West wishes Russia harm as he recalled how some world leaders told him they would not mind Russia's possible disintegration. 'My counterparts, a lot of presidents and prime ministers told me later on that they had decided for themselves by then that Russia would cease to exist in its current form,' he said. 'The only question was when it happens and what consequences would be.'",

But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby,\u00a0when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level, \u00a0measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide .

New view: Local residents from Rausu, Hokkaido, take a look at the newly emerged coastline . Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline, but they do not expect it to expand further, said an official at the central government's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives.

State authorities were suspicious that the 88-year-old author, who is reportedly deaf and blind, was somehow pushed into publishing the forthcoming Go Set a Watchman, and launched two investigations into the circumstances surrounding the launch. Many feared outside influences were at play as Lee, who lives in an nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, had said for decades she wanted To Kill a Mockingbird to be her only published novel. Scroll down for video . Of sound mind: Investigators concluded that Harper Lee, pictured above in 2009, is in a fit state to make decisions about the future of the forthcoming novel Go Set a Watchman . Officials at the state's Department of Human Resources confirmed Monday that their investigation had been completely closed. Earlier Alabama's Securities Commission had sent an investigator\u00a0to speak with her, and said that she answered their questions well enough to convince them she made her own decision, and knew what was happening with her book. The DHR investigation remained open for a time, but spokesman Barry Spear has confirmed that they are now also satisfied that nothing is amiss. Earlier suspicions had in part been fired by the fact that Lee's attorneys had announced the release, due in July, and that publishing house HarperCollins had not had any direct contact with her. Elderly: Lee lives in this nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, and has reportedly been deaf and blind since 2007 . Bobby Segall, a lawyer representing Lee's attorney Tonja Carter, confirmed Monday that they received a letter saying that DHR was closing the investigation with no findings. HarperCollins has announced a July 14 release date for Go Set a Watchman, and will print an initial run of 2million copies. The book is high on Amazon's best-seller list despite some concerns about the novel, which Lee wrote before To Kill A Mockingbird. Lee had long expressed that she's happy to have 1960's Mockingbird' - which won a Pulitzer, was adapted into a movie and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide - as her only published book. Go Set a Watchman, a 304-page novel, is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, although Lee actually wrote it in the mid-1950s, before Mockingbird. Old and new: Go Set a Watchman is a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird - though Lee actually wrote it before the best-selling novel which secured her reputation . The new novel will feature Scout, Mockigbird's protagonist, as an adult woman returning to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City 20 years after the events of To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee thought she had lost the novel's manuscript - but her attorney Tonja Carter found it recently. A statement from Lee, released by HarperCollins, said: 'In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman. 'It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout. 'I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. Not happy to see him: Reporter Connor Sheets received this blunt, handwritten 'Go away!' from Harper Lee when he asked her repeatedly for an interview . 'After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years.' According to publisher Harper, Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird.' Lee has refused to comment further on the novel, helping fire suspicions about her mental state. One Alabamian reporter who tried for two weeks to secure an interview was eventually rewarded with a hand-written note. It read: 'Go away! Harper Lee.'",

But Kai Windsor started life as a girl \u2013 and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body. Christened Kaia, he would shun traditional girls\u2019 toys in favour of kicking a ball around. By four, he refused to wear dresses \u2013 and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls. By nine, he had finally broken the truth to his mother Rachel, 37, telling her: \u2018I\u2019m really a boy.\u2019 Now, at the age of ten, Kai is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman. Miss Windsor, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: \u2018As a toddler, Kai only wanted to play ball. As a girl, he had no interest in any dolls and made a beeline for boy\u2019s toys. \u2018And as soon as he began school, he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did. Soon after, I noticed he went red whenever girls were around.\u2019 Kai is not alone in facing gender problems. The number of transgender referrals to the NHS for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009. Like many parents in her situation, Miss Windsor had never heard of children facing such issues. But the single mother, who runs a health juice business, said Kai had \u2018amazing support\u2019 from his primary school. He was given counselling when his schoolwork started to suffer, and later decided to confront the issue head-on. \u2018They were the ones who suggested Kai should have counselling,\u2019 she said. \u2018Then when he came out as transgender, they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy. \u2018Staff then held a special lesson for all the year to explain about being transgender. And now they are even in the process of building unisex toilets to make life easier for Kai and other children like him.\u2019 Kaia pretty in pink, aged four, pictured left, and dressing up as a pirate, at five, pictured right . When Kai was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female. Miss Windsor, who also has a daughter Jasmine, 16, from a previous relationship, said: \u2018As a toddler I usually put Kaia in dresses and bought her lots of dolls. Meanwhile, as her blonde hair grew, I put in pigtails. It simply never occurred to me she wouldn\u2019t be as feminine as her sister.\u2019 She added: \u2018Looking back Kai knew then he was a boy. He had no interest in dolls, preferring to play with a football. And when we were out he\u2019d head straight for the boy\u2019s section in shops, asking for Spiderman toys.\u2019 At seven, Kai wanted his hair cut shorter. But his grades started suffering and he was later given counselling at school. Within a few weeks, his behaviour and schoolwork improved and last year he officially became transgender after telling his mother one morning. Transgender Kai is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment . Meanwhile, his grades immediately improved. \u2018Once people stopped referring to Kai as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted, he was so much happier,\u2019 she said. Kai is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty. If at the age of 16, he wants to complete the full transition to an adult man, he will be offered gender reassignment surgery. Miss Windsor added: \u2018There have been plenty of tears. It is hard to see your child going through such turmoil. But whatever happens I will always be there to support Kai. \u2018And right now it is just a wonderful relief to see him happy in his own skin at last.\u2019",

Two people were shot in the neck and another was shot in the leg, spokesman Jeff Small said. There is a suspect in custody in the latter case: a 20-year-old male from St. Louis County. The two victims shot in the neck were hospitalized, Small said. \"Police are having a difficult time investigating because of the rocks being thrown at them,\" he said. \"At this point police are not sure if the (shootings are) linked to the protest or not.\" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French posted video on his Twitter account. Multiple gunshots can be heard as people flee in panic. Demonstrators set a portable toilet on fire.  One person can be seen squirting what appears to be lighter fluid on it. pic.twitter.com/FG0P2yf5Uf . The unrest carried on until about 3 a.m. and three police vehicles were damaged by rocks. The renewed tensions in Ferguson follow rioting in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray. The 25-year-old was arrested by police on April 12 and died one week later from a fatal spinal cord injury. Similar deaths over the last year include Michael Brown in Ferguson; Eric Garner in New York; and Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina. CNN's Eliott C.

The drug was developed by the British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour, but was shelved after it proved ineffective. Scientists at Yale University in Connecticut in the US have revealed how the treatment, called AZDO5030, restored memory in mice given Alzheimer's disease. An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal\u2019s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is \u00a326billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'",

Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.",

But now, a young African-American man has released a video disputing claims that all white police officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color', insisting that 'there are good cops out there'. In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Will Stack, a 22-year-old U.S. Army National Guardsman, recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in the state's Lexington County. He explains how he was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse on Wednesday, to make a left turn, when he decided to use the empty median lane to access the left turn lane, which was full. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're bad': Will Stack, 22, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, has released a video (pictured) disputing claims that all white officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color' Moments later, he was stopped by the cop for 'improper use of the median'. 'He told me what I did, asked for my license and registration, I gave that to him,' Mr Stack says in the selfie-style video. He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook\u00a0page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story. Traffic stop: In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Mr Stack recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in South Carolina.

Praise: Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented (above) on Mr Stack's selfie-style video, with many praising him for his honesty amid a national scandal over alleged police brutality . Mixed opinion: Although many of the users' comments were positive, others were negative (as seen bottom) 'The point of this is to say that I am an African-American male, this gentleman was Caucasian. There were no problems. He did his job, I did what I was supposed to do, and that was it,' he says. 'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?'

He told WIS that although he had concerns over the use of force  applied by Officer Slager, 33, he was keeping an open mind about the shooting - and did not believe Scott should have tried to flee. Speaking to the station, Mr Stack, who recently completed a deployment with the National Guard and is now job hunting, said: ' It's possible for African Americans and police officers to get along.

Police in Ragusa, a Sicilian port town, arrested three Syrian men who were at the helm of the Turkish-flagged yacht attempting to reach the Italian coast. It is thought the smugglers had charged each person $8,500 (\u00a35,700) to make the crossing, with police saying the total earned by the organisers was somewhere in the region of \u00a3536,000. Scroll down for video . The luxury yacht, which was flying a Turkish flag, was stopped as it approached Europe with a 'cargo' which is thought to have been worth $800,000 - or \u00a3536,000 - to the organisers . This is far more than the usual cost of\u00a0between 1,000 and 1,500 euros - \u00a3720 to \u00a31,080 - to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. However, the boat was far more seaworthy than some of the other vessels used, which can be anything from\u00a0wooden fishing vessels to old cargo ships. Yet even the yacht failed to make the journey in its entirety: the attempt was discovered when two merchant ships were called out to aid a boat in distress. Selfies and other photos snapped by the Syrian and Palestinian passengers helped police identify the smugglers, police said in a statement. Police also revealed there were 23 children on bard the yacht. Harroum Almotassem Billah,\u00a0Haj Slima Moustafa and\u00a0Sabaj Ahmmed were all arrested for allegedly being part of the crew.

Sabaj Ahmmed was the third member of the alleged crew attempting to bring the migrants, including 23 children, to Europe . The boat is the latest vessel to be stopped making the dangerous crossing from north Africa to Europe, packed with migrants desperate to start a new life.

There were only 28 survivors. These infrared images show the rescue operation after migrant ship capsized on Sunday . Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . Doctor Giuseppe Pomilla, of the Order of Malta, described the three hours he searched for the living among hundreds of dead floating corpses. He told the MailOnline: 'It was like a nightmare.

The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts.

Police exhumed the boy's body from his grave in Norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review. A DNA sample eventually led them to his mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988, just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a Sunday afternoon outing. Scroll down for video . Unsolved case: A police officer searches Windmill Pit, the Norfolk pond where the baby boy's body was found back in 1988 . The boy's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review, with DNA samples leading police to the boy's mother. He has now been reburied at Weasenham St Peter church, Norfolk . Police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at 13th century St Peter's Church in the village. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . But after the body was exhumed in April last year, DNA taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said: 'It came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age. 'We went to see that individual and she told us she was mum. She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. 'We were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her. 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' The woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond, known locally as Windmill Pit, before it was found by a group of teenagers. The boy was originally buried without a name but \u00a0a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church . A second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play. An inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death. The baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named Peter after the name of the church. Det Insp Guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He added: 'This has been unsolved for 27 years. By using the latest techniques, we've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time.' 'We don't ever give up. All the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they're reviewed at regular intervals.' Det Insp Guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' A support group called Hana's Gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter. The inscription reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today . Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'",

Janet and John Brennan have spent eight years and hundreds of thousands of pounds turning Barholm Castle, in Dumfries and Galloway, from a ruin into a stylish castle home. They bought the 15th Century fort, reputed to have been used by leader of the Scottish Protestant Reformation John Knox as a hiding place, for just \u00a365,000. Barnholm Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, which has gone on the market for \u00a3695,000 after being transformed from old ruins . John and Janet Brennan (right) bought Barnholm Castle (left) for just \u00a365,000 in 1997 and have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds renovating it . But now it is on the market for offers over \u00a3695,000 even though at that price the couple will lose a six-figure sum. However, despite that, Janet, 60, and John, 64, insist the project was a 'labour of love' and they have 'no regrets'. The Brennans first stumbled upon the castle near Gatehouse of Fleet - once home to a branch of the powerful McCulloch clan - in 1997 when it was just a shell of crumbling stone walls. It took two years to complete the purchase, four years to get planning permission and three years of restoration. The castle's large living area, pictured, was formerly the great hall in the fortress, which is thought to have once housed Scottish minister John Knox . Barnholm Castle's great vault is now the luxury home's kitchen, which is big enough for a dining table and all modern appliances . One of the four bedrooms in the \u00a3700,000 property. The Brennan's bought the fortress in 1997 and spent four years getting planning permission and two years carrying out the renovation . Even though the property is on the market for \u00a3695,000, the couple have spent hundreds of thousands restoring the castle meaning they will actually incur a loss . The grade A-listed building was lovingly transformed into a stunning home while staying true to its historical roots. Mrs Brennan, the chairwoman of the Scottish Castles Association, admitted: 'The restoration cost more than the asking price but it was a labour of love - we were not doing it for profit. 'We've no regrets. Other people take up golf and they buy boats. We bought a castle.' The retired university lecturer added: 'It was a massive project.

It took two years to fully restore the castle after planning permission was granted. It also has stunning sea views over Wigtown Bay . A decorator paints the ceiling during the castle's restoration. Mrs Brennan says the newly refurbished property would be a fabulous holiday home . 'We were driving and saw a sign on the road saying castle for sale. 'When we drove up the narrow, winding track and saw it we fell in love with it. It was love at first sight. 'We were always interested in castles and visited them over the years. But it was a spur of the moment decision. 'We saved it. It was described as being in a precarious condition.' The castle now has rooms over four floors as well as stunning sea views over Wigtown Bay. The ground floor vaulted chamber has been converted into a kitchen while the great hall has been transformed into a large living space. Four bedrooms are found on the upper floors, including one said to have been used to shelter John Knox.

She described the restoration project as a labour of love . Meanwhile a staircase in the turret leads to upper cap house chamber, with a door to the roof parapet. Mrs Brennan, who has written a book on the subject of restoring castle, added: 'It's an enjoyable experience living in the house. 'It's not that we're selling because we want to leave it - we want to be closer to family. 'I think it would make a fabulous holiday home for someone with deep pockets. 'Or a home for a retired couple who want to live somewhere really special.' John Knox was a Scottish clergyman, who was the leader of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland and often considered the founder of the Presbyterian denomination. He was a Catholic deacon and priest but first joined the movement to reform the Scottish church in the early 1500s. He then went on to teach a number of sons of Protestants who had been captured in St Andrews Castle and called on Knox to become their minister. It was at this time that he is believed to have used Barholm as a place of refuge. In 1547 he was captured by the French, who attacked St Andrews Castle and was kept as a prisoner for over a year. On his release, he travelled to London, where he continued to attack the Roman Catholic faith but left the UK again in 1553 when Mary I became Queen. When he returned to Scotland, he realised how much the teaching of the Reformers was spreading. He then became one of the most well-known preachers in Scotland, with the Scottish Reformation taking place n 1560. Knox is credited with helping to write the Scots Confession of Faith, one of the first formal documents of the Church of Scotland.",

But at the same time he claimed that overall caps on net migration \u2013 as pledged by the Tories \u2013 would be \u2018ludicrous\u2019 because it was impossible to stop people leaving the country. Ukip\u2019s manifesto chief later added to the confusion by saying the 50,000 limit \u2018might change every year\u2019. Confusion over Ukip\u2019s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year . The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration. Ukip first unveiled an immigration cap in February, with spokesman Stephen Woolfe saying the numbers being granted visas limited at 50,000. But at the start of March, Mr Farage overturned this by saying he would not set \u2018arbitrary targets\u2019. At the end of the month, the Ukip leader spoke of a net migration limit of \u2018about 30,000 people a year\u2019. Charlie Elphicke, the Tory candidate in Dover, said: \u2018Ukip\u2019s immigration policy doesn\u2019t just change by the day, it changes by the minute in the space of one interview. It\u2019s complete chaos. \u2018The truth is with Nigel Farage, you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. The only certainty is that a vote for Ukip lets Ed Miliband limp into Downing Street via the backdoor - and then there will be no action on immigration.\u2019 Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme yesterday, Mr Farage said about his party\u2019s cap: \u2018It\u2019s below 50,000 a year, all right? It\u2019s below 50,000 a year. Simple as that. The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration . \u2018But this whole debate we\u2019ve been tied up with caps for five years. It\u2019s devalued the debate. What we\u2019re not actually addressing is the fact that 624,000 people settled in Britain last year and that we have no control over the numbers that settle this year or next year. \u2018Let\u2019s be honest, we cannot have any debate about immigration about numbers while we\u2019re members of the European Union.\u2019 Later in the day, Suzanne Evans, Ukip\u2019s manifesto chief, said the level of the cap might change. She told the BBC News channel: \u2018If we say, we have 21,000 highly skilled people coming from outside of the EU, where there is already a points based system, then we will talk to the businesses, that\u2019s where we get our 50,000 limit from, but that might change every year.\u2019",

In  ISIS's most recent video, a young doctor, identified as Tareq Kamleh, called on foreign medics to travel to the ISIS stronghold in Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service). The video of Kamleh, who refers to himself as Abu Yusuf, showed him handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. Scroll down for video . The blue-eyed Australian doctor who features in the latest IS propaganda video has been identified as\u00a0Tareq Kamleh . Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh introduces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . Once the propaganda video went viral, people from Kamleh's past started to recognise the previously unidentified doctor. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University. Upon completing his degree he reportedly worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. Kamleh then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, the Age reported. He completed his final stint in the Australian medical system working in Perth until late 2014. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University . 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests' A university student who knew Kamleh, but did not want to be named, said he showed no signs that he would defect to the radical militant group. 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests,' she told\u00a0news.com.au. She said the 'clean cut' doctor was well known in her social circle as a 'womaniser' who didn't shy away from drinking alcohol. Kamleh was also recognised by Dr Stephen Napoli, co-owner of the Mannum Medical Centre in South Australia. He told the Age\u00a0the 'intelligent' doctor had interned with him for 10 weeks back in 2010. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge,' Dr Napoli said. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge' Kamleh was known to practice medicine in Adelaide, Mackay and finally in Perth before he took up working for IS . Dr Napoli agreed that Kamleh had shown no signs of holding extreme Islamic views. 'There was no indication I'd be worried about his other associations when he was with us. 'There was nothing that I saw of his work as a medical practical that would suggest he would have any of these sorts of views.' The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic\u00a0Britain's National Health Service . A former college from Adelaide Hospital also came forward reporting that he recognised Kamleh in the footage immediately. 'I was taken aback as much because I certain certainly wouldn't have associated him with an association like IS. His principle seemed to be sound and focused on the care of his patients,' he told the Age. The collegue, who also chose not to be identified, said Kamleh's behaviours were not consistent with the Islamic State's conservative views on drinking or dating. 'I know he dated a few nurses and other doctors over the years\u2026 he was heterosexual and certainly interested in the ladies, with some success.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The video featuring Kamleh, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows the doctor interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,' he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. 'It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. 'We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . 'The video is interesting because it's trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.' 'In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.' Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. 'They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren't trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?' Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas.

In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of online extremist propaganda.

Two 49-year-old women and a 23-year-old man  were removed from the plane just before it left Bristol for Faro around 7pm yesterday (Thursday). Chris Ware, head of security at Bristol Airport said: 'The Bristol Airport police team were requested by flight crew to attend a delayed departing flight to Faro. A Ryanair flight took off without three booked passengers bound for Faro yesterday after they were arrested for being drunk and disorderly . 'The airline requested the delayed passengers board the flight in anticipation of the air traffic slot time improving. 'Three passengers were removed from the aircraft and subsequently arrested. 'Abusive, aggressive or anti-social behaviour on board an aircraft or at the Airport will not be tolerated, the normal protocol of dealing with disruptive passengers was implemented. 'Unfortunately the actions of these individual passengers further delayed the aircraft's departure.' Airport Team Sergeant Mick Parminter added: 'We want everyone who travels through the airport to have a safe and enjoyable start to their trip. 'We would warn anyone travelling through the airport to know their limits. Passengers have a personal responsibility for their own behaviour. 'On average over half a million passengers travel through the airport every month without incident however we will not allow the behaviour of a few to spoil the enjoyment and travel plans for everyone else. 'Alcohol-related anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.' Bristol Airport confirmed that the drunk passengers' actions caused further delays to the Ryanair flight . A spokesperson for Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'The crew of this flight from Bristol to Faro requested police assistance prior to departure after three customers became disruptive. Police removed and detained these individuals before the aircraft departed to Faro. 'We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and we sincerely apologised to other customers for any inconvenience caused. 'The safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. This is now a matter for local police.' This latest incident comes only days after Ryanair took the unprecedented step of banning passengers from bringing their own booze on board flights between Glasgow and the party island of Ibiza out of concerns for safety and comfort. The Dublin-based airline informed passengers travelling on the notorious flight from Glasgow Prestwick Airport to the Spanish island that their alcohol purchases from duty free shops are no longer allowed in the cabin, and they risk being kicked off the flight if they don't comply. In a statement to MailOnline Travel, a Ryanair spokesman said the airline made the decision after consultations with customers and airport officials. The spokesman said: 'Those who have purchased duty free alcohol will be asked to either place their purchases in their cabin baggage and into the hold at the boarding gate, or leave their purchases behind. 'The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our number one priority and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour at any time.' The spokesman declined to identify the incidents which sparked the ban or say what will happen to passengers caught trying to sneak alcohol on board.",

'I always hope to get the best out of my team, but no manager in the world if he is serious can predict a run like this,' Wenger told Arsenal's website. 'In the Premier League it's very difficult to predict.' Arsene Wenger admits he could not have predicted Arsenal's impressive run of results . Aaron Ramsey's goal against Burnley extended the Gunners' record to 16 wins in their last 18 games . Wenger has once again come under fire this season, with fans frustrated by Arsenal's failure to mount a serious title challenge and another last-16 exit in the Champions League. However, with an FA Cup semi-final this weekend and still the chance to chase down Chelsea in the table, Wenger's position at Arsenal is again looking secure. Arsenal have won 16 of 18 games in all competitions and Wenger believes the change in fortune is down to him finally having a relatively injury-free squad. 'It's down to the quality and the attitude of the team, the quality of the spirit we have in the side,' he said. Ramsey celebrates his goal, which helped Arsenal to maintain second place in the Premier League . Arsenal have a slim chance of winning the league, but they must catch Jose Mourinho's Chelsea to do so . 'We prepare (well), we prepare and contribute to our success, that is for sure. What people forgot is that we had big players out for four months this season. 'Six or seven players from the squad completely out. So that made a big difference. 'We have a better balance in the team and some players have made it like (Francis) Coquelin, who contributes to the balance of the team. Hector Bellerin as well has come into the team. 'And big players like (Laurent) Koscielny, like (Mesut) Ozil, like (Olivier) Giroud have been out four months in the season -- four months the three together! 'I have a quality bench and we even have quality players at home like Chamberlain, Arteta, Wilshere. I didn't even try to play Debuchy. We have a big squad and I think we have quality. 'Let's see how we finish the season and after see how we do next season.' Arsenal face Championship side Reading in the FA Cup semi-final this weekend and host Chelsea the following week.",

They are the heart of the home, the hub of dinner parties and usually the \u2018debrief of the day\u2019 meeting room. So what makes a great kitchen? It\u2019s a balance between a warm and inviting design combined with practical efficiency. After judging the kitchens on The Block last week and taking into account what buyers look for in a kitchen, property buyers expert Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design. Activity based design: . The key to ensuring the practicality of your kitchen is to zone areas of the kitchen based on activities e.g. food preparation, cooking, clean-up etc. with storage for those activities within those zones. These areas need to be easily accessible to each other and flow well (e.g. food preparation near the cooking area etc.). There\u2019s no use in a pretty kitchen when your preparation area is on the opposite end of the kitchen from your stovetop. Bench space: . This is one of the most common bugbears when buyers are looking at kitchens. Enough bench/counter space is crucial not only for food preparation but also for serving when entertaining. Scroll down for video . There was plenty of bench space in Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen on The Block . Storage space: . Plenty of storage space is essential and you need to find a good balance between design aesthetics and practicality. Take into account what\u2019s most important for you in terms of storage, as I recommended a Walk-in pantry vs a Butler\u2019s pantry, consider whether having extra space for preparation and a large area to hide your appliances is paramount to you or whether a larger area for food storage is more vital. Judge Neale Whitaker said\u00a0Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual\u00a0the flare, confidence or pizzazz' Sufficient lighting: . As the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Jury discussed when viewing Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen, it\u2019s not an area of the home that you can get away with the \u2018bare bones\u2019 when it comes to lighting. For the purpose of safety in food preparation and cooking, good lighting is paramount. Specifically in the preparation, cooking and cleaning areas, it\u2019s essential to have good quality lighting. Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen lacked lighting above the benchtop according to\u00a0Frank Valentic . Splash backs: . In the cooking and cleaning zones of the kitchen, splashbacks are important and while design is also important, it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of practicality. Try and find a good medium between something that looks great but is also low maintenance and easy to clean! The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background . Ventilation: . Akin to the bathroom, the kitchen requires great ventilation so ensure you have a good quality range hood and windows that can be opened. Valentic says there was 'great ventilation' in Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchen . Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges . Flow on: . The overall design of your home really needs to come into play when designing a kitchen. The flow between the living areas, specifically dining areas and the kitchen are important. As we mentioned when judging Jess and Ayden\u2019s and Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchens, a kitchen with a flow on to an outdoor entertaining area is very much in demand at the moment and a huge plus for buyers. Jess and Ayden\u2019s kitchen had a 'great flow' on from the living and dining areas . Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win and add $10,000 to their kitty . Valentic's example of a kitchen at 12 Kyarra Street in Hampton that would attract buyers' attention . Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design . In the end, Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen for the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Judges showed the best balance between design and a practical layout. While a kitchen is a very personal area of the home, make sure to take into account re-sale when renovating so that it doesn\u2019t affect the value of your property when you re-sell it. However,\u00a0if The Block: Triple Threat judges were the buyers this week, they would have walked away from each of the team's apartments without placing an offer. Judging trio Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer were all left largely unimpressed by the kitchens delivered by the Blockheads on last Sunday night's episode. The lacklustre performance, in the eye of the judges, meant that Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win of the series and add $10,000 to their kitty. The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background. Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges. Meanwhile, Whitaker said Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual the flare, confidence or pizzazz'. The living area, dining room, and kitchen flow onto the outdoor entertaining space .",

His sleepless nights must be becoming all the more frequent as these haunting weeks go by. Down rained the boos yet again from a disgruntled bunch of supporters who deserve so much more than this; far more than a team lacking identity and direction. Those fans will quite rightly point to the fact their side were out-played for large parts against Rotherham, a club with a far inferior budget and experience at this level. They are losing faith in their manager, even though Fulham should retain their Championship status from here. Ross McCormack (left) pokes home the equaliser but Fulham were unable to push on for the winner . That they came away with a point was down to poor finishing from the Yorkshire visitors, nothing more. Ross McCormack came to the rescue after Matt Derbyshire\u2019s early opener to spare blushes. Fulham just want this wretched campaign over. \u2018First half we were awful,\u2019 Symons said. \u2018Second half was a huge improvement to a bit better than awful. We\u2019re limping closer. \u2018The sooner we get the points needed the sooner I\u2019ll start sleeping in an evening.\u2019 That spoke volumes. Kit Symons (centre) admitted his side were second best and says the club need to rebuild in the summer . \u2018It is slow and it\u2019s painful. We need to rebuild in the summer. It\u2019s an anxious period - people are concerned. The players did show good character to come from behind.\u2019 Steve Evans\u2019 team still await their fate after being charged for fielding an ineligible player, Farrend Rawson, during the win against Brighton earlier this month. Should the Football League follow the precedent set with AFC Wimbledon last year, the Millers will find themselves lumped with a three-point deduction. When that judgement is to be made remains unclear - although it almost certainly will come before the final day on May 2 - meaning the relegation dogfight could go to the wire, with resurgent Millwall enjoying a game in hand. Rotherham knew points must be won here, and set about bossing proceedings from the very first minute. Matt Derbyshire (centre) pokes home the opener after four minutes to put Steve Evans' side in the lead . Fulham XI:\u00a0Bettinelli, Richards, Turner, Burn, Husband, Parker, Guthrie, Tunnicliffe (Hoogland - 54), Ruiz, McCormack, Smith . Subs not used:\u00a0Kiraly, Stafylidis, Hutchinson, Woodrow, Rodallega, Kavanagh . Goals: McCormack 67 . Booked: Guthrie, Burn, Turner . Rotherham XI: Martinez, Hunt, Morgan, Broadfoot, Lafferty; Smallwood, Arnason, Frecklington, Pringle; Ward, Derbyshire . Subs not used:\u00a0Collin, Wilson, Wood, Hammill, Bowery, Milsom, Green . Goals: Derbyshire 4 . Booked: Broadfoot . Referee: Andy Davies . How it came to pass that Matt Derbyshire might\u2019ve put the visitors three goals up inside the first four minutes will mystify Symons. Eventually the former Olympiacos striker settled for one, the simplicity galling for a club who were facing Tottenham this time a year ago. Firstly Derbyshire clipped wide inside the six-yard box before the long legs of Dan Burn prevented him from tapping home seconds later. But Fulham fell asleep from Ben Pringle\u2019s corner to present Derbyshire with a third opportunity and he wasn\u2019t to miss, stabbing in from close range to signal the Craven Cottage dissenters to find their voice. Matt Smith\u2019s header was cleared off the line in an instant reply, but Symons\u2019 side looked shot, as they had been here against Brentford and Wigan previously. And they allowed Derbyshire in again, this time Burn misreading a high ball, but he was thwarted by Marcus Bettinelli. Danny Ward squandered a glorious chance from 12 yards, skewing a shot wide as Fulham continued to be carved open. Bryan Ruiz (10) is denied a goal by the on-rush Arsenal loanee\u00a0Emiliano Martinez of Rotherham . Fulham's remaining  fixtures:\u00a0Blackpool\u00a0(A), Middlesbrough\u00a0(H),Norwich (A) Rotherham's remaining fixtures: Norwich (H), Reading (H), Leeds (A) Kirk Broadfoot was guilty of missing a superb chance from another corner and the central defender later struck a post. Saying they could have scored five before the break isn\u2019t hyperbolic. 'They could've been out of sight,' admitted Symons. Bryan Ruiz spurned a good opportunity for the hosts, McCormack then failing to stretch far enough to covert at the back post. Every stray pass was met with groans, each overhit cross with sighs. Many are resigned to these turgid displays, but more than a small section just will not accept it. Symons was bailed out by McCormack though, who got on the end of Scott Parker\u2019s pass to poke in a 67th-minute equaliser. It was a rare moment of quality, but edges them closer to safety. Matt Smith (centre) was unable to continue his good goalscoring form for the Cottagers . \u2018The goal is a blatant handball by McCormack,\u2019 Rotherham assistant Paul Raynor fumed. \u2018We dominated possession and created a number of opportunities.\u2019 \u2018You hope something\u2019s going to fall for us. One thing that can never be labelled against our team is a lot of character and desire. That\u2019s the minimum we expect. We\u2019re enjoying the challenge and had a difficult week. A good word to use is defiance.\u2019 Symons added: \u2018I\u2019ve seen the goal again and there\u2019s probably an element of doubt, but I\u2019d expect them to have a moan about it.\u2019 The goal gave the whole place a lift, Smith unfortunate not to win a penalty after Craig Morgan\u2019s shove and substitute Tim Hoogland thumped a header over when unmarked at the back post. Oddly, one point may have been three but that would\u2019ve merely masked glaring deficiencies. For all the talk of difficulties, staying in the division is the only thing that matters. Time for Fulham to press reset and start again.",

Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too. Two-faced: This 440kg bull, which has faces on top of each other, was sold to an abattoir last month . Double-headed: The female calf born that was born in Whiting, Vermont, two years ago .

But Sharon and Mike Tierney have taken their mutual upkeep to a whole new level, believing that 'the couple that waxes together, stays together.' The Sydney-based duo set aside an evening once a month to tend to all their beauty maintenance needs. Sharon, 45, trims her 40-year-old husband's eyebrows, wax his nostrils and even grooms his pubic hair. Scroll down for video . High maintenance: Sydney couple Mike and Sharon Tierney set aside one evening per month for mutual grooming . You wax my back, I'll wax yours: Sharon trims her husband's eyebrows, waxes his nostrils and trims his pubic hairs, while he returns the favours with waxing, spray tans and eyelash tints . For his part, Mike has been well trained in the art of waxing, and waxes her underarms, legs, upper lip and chin, and can even perform a Brazilian wax. The British ex-pat can also tint eyelashes and give Sharon a spray tan. Sharon admits while some women are horrified about their man seeing their lady parts in all their hairy glory, she says there's no limitations to their marriage. 'He\u2019s seen everything, there\u2019s nothing I wouldn't not let him see,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Being a well-groomed gentleman can be a dangerous undertaking though. Regime: While most couples may admit to assisting each other with squeezing the odd hard-to-reach pimple, but Sharon and Mike take it to a whole new level . Close cut: One hair incident involved Sharon attempting to give her husband a 'number one', and ended up cutting his scrotum . 'He says it\u2019s for neatness,' Sharon said of her husband's preference for a 'number one' in the pubic region, 'but I think it\u2019s to gain that precious \u201coptical inch\u201d.' One evening during their usual pluck, wax and clipping session, things got a little bit hairy. 'I thought we should stretch the optical illusion to its limits, so I removed the clipper guard to get the closest possible trim. We were coasting along brilliantly until we hit the scrotum and its soft, sagging, sensitive skin,' she said. The worst happened, and a poor, screaming Mike was left with a bleeding cut in the most sensitive of body parts. 'I was just trying to make his penis look bigger,' said Sharon. 'Not that it\u2019s not big, but that\u2019s what men want isn\u2019t it?\u201d' The trimmed twosome began their mutual grooming regime together 13 years ago. The couple met in London at a Pop Idol party when Sharon was on a holiday to the UK. Their fling turned into a relationship, with Sharon moving to London. During her time their, she struggled to find a decent waxing therapist. Upon returning to Australia, Sharon spent six months training in beauty therapy to open her own salon, and turned to her husband to play guinea pig. Guinea pig: Mike was enlisted when Sharon was training to become a professional waxer and needed someone to practise on . Mike was enlisted to step in when she was training up her junior therapists.\u00a0'One of the girls said her boyfriend could do it but they broke up two days before and we needed a model and I told Mike we were desperate - and he agreed, Sharon told Daily Mail Australia. 'God love him, there he was butt naked in front of my blonde, 20 year old staff, he would do anything to support me.' In business: After struggling to find a decent wax while living in London, Sharon trained and opened her own salon upon returning to Australia . 'He's a good sport and just goes along with it - which is nice because he's English and very conservative - it shows he will do anything for me.' 'I get Mike to use a bit of both types of wax. Usually strip wax on your labia is too sensitive, so I use it around the edges and use a hot wax on intimate areas, such as Veet Naturals Warm Wax.' While the sliced scrotum wasn't severe enough to land Mike in the hospital, an ill-timed bout of appendicitis did spell embarrassment for the Englishman. 'It was only an hour after getting waxed he was rushed to hospital with emergency appendicitis,' said Sharon. 'A young female doctor  said, \"I'm really sorry we have to check your testicles,\" and he was so embarrassed. From London to Oz: The couple met in the UK when Australian Sharon was there on holiday 13 years ago . Metro man: From clipping and trimming to waxing and tinting, men are more open to beauty maintenance than ever . 'She asked what I did for a living and I said - \"you\u2019re about to find out!\" She was in fits of laughter when I told her and poor Mike had all these doctors checking out his freshly waxed scrotum.' 'But in the end because all the hospital staff knew, everyone ended up taking brochures and we got a heap of new clients, so it turned it into a positive thing. Not to mention he quite enjoyed all the nurses saying \"oh you\u2019re the one with the Brazilian.\" ' As for their ventures 'down under' together, Sharon has now written a tell-all book to give women guidance on what's normal down there and a expose on their hilarious adventures together, aptly titled 'The Vagina Buffet.' 'I think when you put your hand on someone\u2019s vagina it\u2019s like they get verbal diarrhoea, they want to get comfortable with you and tell you everything, it\u2019s unbelievable how much I've learned about people and the vagina.'",

During a lesson on tolerance and acceptance, children at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point were read I Am Jazz, a book about\u00a0a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender. Some parents are unhappy with the school after they say their children came home with questions about gender and wondering if they too might be trans. I Am Jazz is a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender . One unnamed mom was so angry she contacted conservative pundit Sean Hannity after she felt that the school ignored her initial complaint. 'I feel like my thoughts, feelings and beliefs were completely ignored\u2026.My right as a parent to allow or not allow this discussion with my child was taken from me. It is very upsetting to me that I didn't have an option at all,' she told\u00a0Hannity.com. 'When I spoke with the principal he was very cold about it. It's amazing how thoughtless the school has been with this whole thing.' The mother claims that lesson prompted her 7-year-old son to start asking a lot of questions and questioning if he might be trans - something that he had never previously spoken about. 'I was taken aback by it\u2026 Being seven, once you put something in their mind they don't forget so easily,' she said. In the wake of Hannity contacting the school asking for clarity, officals have now apologized. Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, said she supported the reading of the book but admitted that parents should have been first notified. Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues . Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, admitted that parents should have been first notified . 'We have a practice of if a topic is considered sensitive, parents should be informed. In this situation, that didn't happen,' she said. 'The whole culture at Mitchell School is about teaching tolerance and respect. The people presenting the lesson thought [I Am Jazz] was one more piece of teaching that lesson. In retrospect, we understand that toleration is tolerating people of all opinions.' But at least one parents has come out in support of the school's initial decision to select the book as appropiate for teaching young students. 'People in this country, parents in this country are outraged by bullying, teen suicide rates and the depression in children. The staff of Mitchell School is doing something about this. By teaching acceptance and love they are shedding a light on [LGBTI] issues,' reports Gay Star News. 'LGBTQ issues should never be classified as a \"sensitive subject\" \u2014 there is nothing sensitive about the way we are born. Blonde hair, brown hair, gay, straight or somewhere in-between, we are all people and we all need acceptance.' The book at the center of the controversy, I Am Jazz, is based off of the life of now 14-year-old Jazz Jennings who, although born a boy, claims to have identified as a girl since he was two-years-old. 'From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing,' reads the book's description on Amazon.com. 'This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers.'",

Owners admit they spend hours watching the box with their animals and even leave it on when they are out to keep them company. And the nation's cats, dogs and pigs show a marked preference for programmes featuring other animals while shunning reality shows such as the Keeping Up With The Kardashians and TOWIE. Paul O'Grady's show 'For the Love of Dogs' is an absolute television favourite of pets . Almost two thirds of goldfish owners, 63 per cent, even confess to putting the tank in sight of the TV so their fish can watch it for more than three and a half hours a day. The survey of 1,000 pet owners even found the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch four hours of shows per day - or 28 hours a week. The new study by Virgin Media reveals how much our household pets love sitting in front of the box and watching their favourite TV programmes. Over a third of us, 34 per cent, say their pets watch three hours a day while left home alone - the equivalent of 42 episodes of EastEnders in a week. A quarter, 24 per cent, say their pets love watching TV so much they spend an incredible nine hours glued to it every day. Two-thirds of goldfish owners owned up to putting the bowl in sight of the TV and even the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch 28 hours of TV a week . A survey has revealed that on average, pets watch 21 hours of TV of week, whether its with their owners or by themselves . A square-eyed one per cent of dogs are glued to the TV for over 10 hours. Owners heading off to work or spending the day out feel guilty for leaving their pet alone, as 29 per cent admit they turn on the TV as they believe their animal may get lonely without them. Pets\u2019 favourite show is TV presenter Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s For The Love Of Dogs as 17 per cent of animal owners said their pet can\u2019t get enough of it. Documentary Natural World is a hit with pets as 14 per cent of owners say it\u2019s their animals\u2019 favourite show. Springwatch is pets\u2019 third favourite show with 12 per cent of votes - and soap EastEnders is surprisingly fifth with 11 per cent.

According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege. A 24-year-old supermarket employee, Malian-born Lassana Bathily, was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from Coulibaly in the cold room. The hostage-taking was the culmination of three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The two brothers blamed for that attack, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed on January 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site. The terror attacks claimed the lives of 17 people and put France on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Ariana Williams reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Coming in the 86th minute of Saturday's match it was by no means his most spectacular, a mere flick from six yards out enough to take the ball past Adrian after a scuffed Jamie Vardy shot. But it was enough to defeat West Ham in a frenetic match and breathe life back into the side he has spent his whole career playing for. Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points . King is joined by David Nugent to celebrate his goal, the 50th he has scored for his club . Leicester remain at the foot of the Barclay\u2019s Premier League table, a spot they have occupied since November, and four points from safety. But King, 26, thinks the momentum they are taking into the final eight matches of the season could be enough to propel them above the drop zone. \u2018I\u2019ve scored some pretty crucial goals before, but we might look back at the end of the season and that might turn out to be the most important one yet,\u2019 said King, . \u2018It\u2019s always nice to score for the only club you\u2019ve ever played for. I\u2019ve had a brilliant journey with this club. 'I\u2019ve been on 49 for a long time, and I\u2019ve been in the Premier League for a good few months now - I was hoping it would\u2019ve come earlier but I\u2019ve ticked that milestone off now and I\u2019m delighted about that. Nigel Pearson admits Leicester survival is still a 'big ask' despite win over West Ham . Pearson congratulates goalscorer Cambiasso after the final whistle of his side's win against the Hammers . \u2018But most importantly it was about getting the three points and we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of the season to make sure we\u2019re a Premier League team next season. \u2018We\u2019ve played well enough to prove we can survive and we\u2019ve not turned it into results - this is a results business. That proves to everyone - not just ourselves - that we mean business.\u2019 Leicester manager Nigel Pearson praised King, who he brought off the bench with 12 minutes to play and said his team were finally getting the results they deserved after several games this season where they have drawn or lost despite dominating. \u2018I would love to be a lucky manager who plays crap and wins but we have not been that,\u2019 he said. King says his goal against West Ham may turn out to be his most important for the club if they stay up . \u2018It would be a pretty grumpy man who wouldn't let them enjoy winning but we have to keep our destiny in our own hands.\u2019 His opposite number Sam Allardyce denied West Ham were \u2018drifting\u2019 towards the end of the season having won just twice in the last 14 games. \u2018We\u2019re not drifting but where we\u2019re failing is we\u2019re not as clinical as we used to be. Lads in their first season have found out what physical and mental attributes are needed for a long premier league season.\u2019",

An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season. Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton . Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League. Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay. 'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said. 'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong. 'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest. 'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club. Clyne made his full England debut last November . 'We need understanding for that but nothing else. 'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. We know our level, we know our possibilities. 'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.' Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign. 'We don't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something,' he said. 'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on. 'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.' Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull. Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez. It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City. There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week. 'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them. 'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club. Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool . Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence . 'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.' Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future. Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned. But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager. 'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'",

Potential attendees were contacted by the right-leaning For America non-profit and told to write back by May 10 for a chance to open fire alongside O'Neill. Shoot with The Shooter: Supporters of a conservative nonprofit were offered the change of a luxury stay in Wyoming with Robert O'Neill, pictured while still in the Navy, which would include a 'machine gun fun' contest . Citing 'security reasons', the invitation, acquired by the Washington Post, did not say exactly when the event would be - but was clear about the hefty price tag. For their substantial donation, guests will be put up in the Amangani Resort Hotel, a sprawling luxury complex perched in the Rocky Mountains, on the edge of the Grand Teton National Park. Also included is the Jackson Hole Shooting Experience, which will see clay pigeon shooting, pistol events as well as the 'machine gun fun' session. The shooting will take the form of a competition, in which guests will try to beat O'Neill's score. Lock and load: Part of the double-handed trip would see guests try out the Jackson Hole Shooting Experience, including pistols, clay pigeon shooting as fully automatic weapons. The gun range is pictured above . Lush: Guests would be housed at the\u00a0Amangani Resort Hotel, a mountain hotel complex on the edge of a national park . He has described his shooting prowess in great detail previously, specifically how he hit terrorist leader Bin Laden three times in the head, ending his life. Describing the top-secret 2011 raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, O'Neill wrote: 'He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].' In the account for Esquire magazine - written while he was still anonymous - O'Neill continued: 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap!' 'The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out.

A spokesman for O\u2019Neill told the Washington Post that he was participating in the big-money event 'as a favor to a friend who has been helping him out'. On its website, ForAmerica\u00a0claims to spearhead a new conservative movement on social media. Its introductory texts says that conservatives are 'outnumbered and being hit on both flanks', which it identifies as 'the radical Left' and moderate Republicans. O'Neill leaped into the public spotlight last autumn, coming forward to identify himself as the solider previously known only as The Shooter on Veterans' Day last winter. He spoke at length to Fox News about his exploits in a two-part documentary, and has made numerous speaking engagements since. However, his public discussions of a top-secret mission have angered many in the SEALs, including top commanders who said he was breaking the organization's code of honor by seeking fame. It later emerged that he was being investigated by The Naval Criminal Investigative Service for allegedly revealing classified information. An NCIS spokesman today confirmed that the investigation is still active.",

'I find [it] extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once!' he wrote. Scroll down for video . A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (\u00a3690,000). Above, he wrote that the Leibniz notation was 'extremely difficult' It was written at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and paved the way for computer science.\u00a0It is believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript known to exist, the auctioneer said. Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said:\u00a0'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to 'cure' his homosexuality. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous.

Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full\u00a0qualifying\u00a0report. Host commentator . Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday\u2019s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson . \u2018Oh come on, guys\u2019, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn\u2019t matter as Rosberg can\u2019t beat his lap. It is Hamilton\u2019s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they\u2019re all on fresh tyres. Here we go\u2026 . Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We\u2019ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903\u2026 but it is Hamilton up next. We\u2019ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we\u2019re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10\u2026 surely, Lewis Hamilton won\u2019t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we\u2019re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen, \u00a0but he is half-a-second off Hamilton\u2019s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton\u2026 what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That\u2019s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow\u2019s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go\u2026 . Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn\u2019s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the \u2018rears are overheating\u2019. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth\u2026 for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes is fired up, but there\u2019s no problem with the world champion\u2019s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap\u2026 . Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week\u2019s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday\u2019s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: \u2018I want a car. I\u2019ve got a ticket.\u2019 Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon\u2019s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton\u2019s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today\u2019s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they \u00a0were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.",

But unlikely as it may seem, Niamh Geaney, 26, and Karen Branigan, 29, aren't the only pair to have found their real-life doppelg\u00e4ngers, either by mistake or after a social media hunt. Now three similar British cases have been revealed; a London-based journalist who found hers in Birmingham, two male university students, also in London, and two retired men in Essex. Scroll down for video . What are the odds? Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, (right) moved to Braintree in Essex to be confronted with his doppelg\u00e4nger, former head teacher\u00a0John Jemison, 74, (left) Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old TV presenter from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' last week in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, moved to Braintree and was surprised to greeted with waves and 'hello John' greetings wherever he went. 'John' turned out to be John Jemison, a 74-year-old former head teacher who was well-known to the town, and just so happened to look exactly like Mr Richardson. Upon meeting, the pair, who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised that as well as being doppelg\u00e4ngers, they had an awful lot in common. Both had attended the same college, and both became RE teachers and choir singers. The pair finally came face-to-face in March when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a Friends of Braintree Museum visit to the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library. 'It was quite spooky,' said Mr Jemison, adding that they 'hit it off immediately' and are now friends. 'My only worry is the number of people who probably think I've been ignoring them when they've been saying \"Hello John\" to Neil all this time.' Upon meeting, Mr Richardson (left) and Mr Jemison (right), who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised they  had a lot in common in terms of their life stories . Mr Richardson married his wife in 1968 (left) while Mr Jemison also married wife Jenny in the sixties (right) In 2011, Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed became fascinated by the idea that there might be someone out there in the world who looked exactly like her. In fact, she was the inspiration behind Miss Geaney's ultimately successful social media search. In much the same way, Ms Robehmed launched her mission to find her doppelg\u00e4nger by publicising it on Facebook, YouTube, and through blogs around the world. And just like Miss Geaney, it turned out that Ms Robehmed didn't need to look that far. Her closest match turned out to be Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher, who worked in the film industry and shared a mutual friend. Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed (right) launched a hunt to find her 'twin stranger' in 2011 and found\u00a0Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher (left) through a mutual friend . After seeing Ms Hatcher's photo, Miss Robehmed set up a meeting in Covent Garden in London, and the rest is history. And in another accidental result, doppelg\u00e4ngers Jonny Sandgrove and Michael Harris, both based in London, got to know each other at university. As cases of mistaken identity around the campus began to mount up, the pair met, again though mutual acquaintances, and ultimately became firm friends. Doppelg\u00e4ngers Jonny Sandgrove (left) and Michael Harris (right), both based in London, got to know each other at University, after friends kept getting them confused . When Mr Harris married his then-girlfriend Naomi a little while later, several members of his family approached Johnny at the wedding to congratulate him. All this comes after Miss Geaney and Miss Branigan's story blew up across the media yesterday, for being the most twin-like case yet. Miss Geaney, a TV presenter, found Miss Branigan after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called Twin Strangers. This is the moment that Miss Geaney (right) met her doppleganger Miss Branigan (left) for the first time . 'I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me' Miss Geaney (right) said about Miss Branigan (left) The aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website TwinStrangers from across the world. Incredibly, Miss Geaney found Miss Branigan in just two weeks - just an hour away. After their first meeting she said: \u2018I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn\u2019t get over her face. \u2018And some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \u201cOh my God that\u2019s my face\u201d. I can\u2019t remember the number of times I said \u201cthis is so freaky\u201d. It was truly amazing. Uncanny: Miss Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Miss Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . \u2018I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,\u2019 said Miss Geaney. \u2018But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. I\u2019m the weirdo that contacted Karen and asked her to meet me.\u2019 Miss Branigan, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Miss Geaney has two sisters and a brother, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Since meeting, Miss Greaney and Miss Branigan - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Miss Branigan (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Miss Geaney (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \"Oh my God that\u2019s my face\"' While Miss Geaney appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry English said. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence Manzanga. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!' Miss Geaney (right) said she and Miss Branigan (left) got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities (pictured) Friends for life? Since meeting, Miss Geaney (right) and Miss Branigan (left) - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly' Feedback: Shocked reactions to \u00a0their story have flooded in from far and wide . Challenge: Miss Geaney's (right) fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry (left) and 22-year-old Terence (centre), are still looking for their doppelg\u00e4ngers, and the search isn't over until April 27 . Miss Geaney, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' She said. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'",

The oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a Catholic saint was believed to be the work of a 'follower' of 16th century renaissance master El Greco. But the selling price suggests the untitled, undated and unsigned painting may actually have been done by the artist himself. Auctioneer Richard Bromell (pictured) gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 but it ended up selling for more than \u00a3120,000 . It was acquired by the owner's late father in the 1970s for very little. He bought it because he believed it was a depiction of Saint Peter, who shares his name. And it was inherited by his son, who has not been named, who kept it in his loft for the past eight years before deciding to sell it following a clear-out. Auctioneer Richard Bromell, of Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset, gave the work an estimated value of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400. But after advertising the sale, interest in the work took off. And feverish bidding, final hammer price was \u00a398,000 and came to \u00a3120,932 with all the fees added on. Mr Bromell said: 'I rung the client after the sale and just told him it sold for ninety-eight. He asked 'what pounds?' And I told him it was \u00a398,000. 'He said he needed to sit down. When he came down off the ceiling he was very, very pleased. I think if he had been offered \u00a3500 for it before the auction he would have snapped your hand off.' The oil painting (right) was believed to have been the work of a follower of\u00a016th century renaissance master El Greco (left) but the selling price suggests it may have been done by the artist himself . Mr Bromell explained it was very difficult to judge the painting. He said: 'We described it as by a follower of El Greco because that is what it looked like and I still think that to be the case. 'It was a very interesting picture and very hard to value. 'If you asked three people the question 'how much is it worth?' you would get three different answers. One reputable gallery stopped bidding at \u00a310,000 because that was how much they were prepared to pay for it. 'Obviously as least two people thought it was worth the money because the bidding just went up and up. 'We must have advertised it well because all the right people attended the sale. On the day of the sale I thought it might go for a few thousand pounds so we were obviously delighted with the outcome. 'People play their cards very close to their chest at these things and the person who bought it came in and was only interested in this item and nothing else.'",

Great fast bowler Ambrose never spoke to the media during his playing career but launched his aptly titled autobiography Time to Talk on the eve of the West Indies-England series. Ambrose was one of the West Indies stars, along with Sir Viv Richards and Richie Richardson, who accompanied Stanford when he flew by helicopter to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch his five-year deal with England that ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence, just one $20million T20 game into the contract. The England cricket team's involvement with  Allen Stanford  has been defended by  Sir Curtly Ambrose . Stanford's deal with England England ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence . Ambrose wrote: 'I wasn't surprised the England Cricket Board officials were taken in by him. We all were. His vision to improve West Indies cricket by using England seemed a hard one to argue with. But we felt that having England as the same opponents over that period would turn things stale.' Richardson said: 'He employed a lot of people in several businesses and built a stadium. He did a lot of good. We thought what he was doing was legitimate.' Richards added: 'To a lot of fellers here, he did well.' Ambrose accompanied Stanford when he flew to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch the deal . The new ECB president Giles Clarke\u00a0did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy saying it was a long time ago . However, the new ECB president Giles Clarke, who negotiated the doomed deal and greeted Stanford on his arrival at Lord's with a bear hug, did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy. Before the Wisden launch last week at which he made a fool of himself by haranguing both the guest speaker and Wisden editor Lawrence Booth, Clarke would only say of Stanford: 'That was all a long time ago.' Perhaps it's no surprise, with Stanford's decaying cricket stadium just outside Antigua's airport there for all visitors to see, that Clarke is swerving today's first Test on the island. Michael Vaughan might still be a long way from agreeing terms and working patterns to become England's director of cricket. But he is staying at England's luxury Sugar Ridge Hotel in Antigua, so he's right in the middle of any politics going on over the appointment of a director and ideally placed to judge the mood music of players and management. Director of cricket hopeful Michael Vaughan is staying at England's luxury Sugar Ridge Hotel in Antigua . England\u00a0rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster seems unperturbed by criticism that after four successive second places in the Six Nations, he's been talking the talk, rather than walking the walk. Lancaster has a speaking engagement a week today in aid of the Dallaglio Foundation along with Sir Clive Woodward, Lawrence Dallaglio and captain Chris Robshaw at a \u00a3225-a-head function. The RFU say all Lancaster's talks in the run-up to the World Cup are for charity. Stuart Lancaster seems unperturbed by criticism that\u00a0he's been talking the talk, not walking the walk .

The xylella fastidiosa bacteria has ravaged olive trees in the Puglia region and contributed to a 35 percent drop in the region's olive oil production last year. Its spread has so alarmed the EU that France announced a boycott of Puglian fruit and vegetables, while its effect on production will mean shortages in the supply of olive oil and is likely to lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world. An Italian forestry official stands guard as workers begin chopping down an infected olive oil tree . Police officers were also on hand to maintain order after protesters attempted to stop the trees' destruction . A forestry official walks past the fenced-off remains of an olive oil tree destroyed in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease . A forestry worker cuts through the stump of a tree infected with the deadly xylella fastidiosa bacteria . Puglian growers have opposed the government's destruction plan, saying it won't stop the bacteria's spread . However, Puglian growers have opposed the government's slash-and-burn plan, saying it won't contain the bacteria's spread. Several dozen protesters tried unsuccessfully yesterday to block the first seven trees from being felled in Oria, near Brindisi, even climbing the branches and shouting 'assassins.' Eventually, the first seven trees were cut down and are to be burned today, with more to follow. Many of Italy's oldest olive groves, some dating back 500 years, have been infected by the bacterium, which causes plants to shrivel, leaving them incapable of bearing fruit. Puglia, a region in the heel of Italy, produces about 11million tons of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop, and they are used to make some of the country's best oils. The initial area to be culled is 20,000 acres \u2013 about 30 sq miles \u2013 between Lecce to Brindisi. It contains around 11million trees, according to Unaprol, the largest consortium of growers. It is feared that unless drastic action is taken to fell the groves, the bacterium will spread to other olive-producing regions of Italy such as Tuscany and Umbria, and even to other Mediterranean countries. Last month Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Food Safety and Security, said he was 'profoundly concerned by the gravity of the situation'. He added: 'We have to take decisive measures with immediate effect. Naturally it is very painful for the growers but it is necessary to remove all the affected trees, it is the most effective measure.' The bacteria (right) causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit. Pictured left are protesters sitting in the branches of an olive oil tree earmarked for destruction . The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy . Below is a summary of the Italian virgin olive oil market worldwide, according to Unaprol (organisation of Italian oil producers), showing the main importing countries: . USA:\u00a0Italy holds a market share of 51 per cent, with exports up 2 per cent in 2013. AUSTRIA:\u00a0Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 48 per cent share. BRAZIL:\u00a0Italy is the fourth-largest virgin oil supplier to Brazil with 7 per cent of the market, following Portugal, Spain and Argentina. CANADA:\u00a0Italy is in pole position with a market share of 70 per cent in 2013. CHINA:\u00a0Italy is the second-largest virgin oil supplier. In 2013, the market share was 21 per cent. KOREA:\u00a0Italy is the second-largest virgin oil supplier. JAPAN:\u00a0Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 45 per cent share and a growth of 6 per cent. HONG KONG:\u00a0Italy is the main virgin oil supplier. INDIA:\u00a0Italy is the second-largest virgin oil supplier on the Indian market after Spain.

Romantic Ben Parsons, 34, of Brighton, East Sussex, stunned girlfriend Anna Jefferson, 36, by getting down on one knee after running 24 and a half miles. She was watching her boyfriend run in the Brighton marathon with their children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months. Ben Parson, 34, paused in the middle of the Brighton marathon and proposed to his surprised girlfriend, Anna Jefferson, 36 . Anna feared her boyfriend was struggling when he started to slow down on Hove seafront, because she was unaware of his proposal plan. Ben then got down on one knee and popped the question and Anna said yes, before Ben ran onward towards the finishing line, still managing to get a personal best timing and completing his sixth Brighton Marathon in 3hrs 36min. Ben, a media law lecturer at the University of Brighton, carried the ring in his bum bag and waited to spot Anna in the crowd on Sunday. He said: 'I wanted to do something romantic to surprise Anna and the marathon has such a feelgood, loved-up atmosphere anyway so I knew it would be the perfect time. Ben Parson had already run 24.5 miles of the 26.2-mile Brighton marathon when he stopped to propose to girlfriend and mother of his two children, Anna Parsons . At the time, Anna had been stood in the crowds with children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months . 'Judging by the look on her face, she was certainly surprised. 'Once Anna had said 'yes' and we'd had a big sweaty hug I had to get on the move again so my legs wouldn't seize up. 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com. 'I had an extra spring in my step for the last mile and a half.' 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com': After Anna said yes, Ben carried on with the marathon . He said that the pressure of the proposal spurred him on and brought the finishing line a bit closer. But he joked: 'If I hadn't seen her in the crowd maybe I would have just carried on to the end and taken the ring back to Argos.' Anna, who works for Arts Council England, and has been dating Ben since they met at City College Brighton in 2002, said she never expected the proposal. She said: 'There had been a guy just before him who had got a cramp and had to stop for his friends to massage his leg. Newly-engaged: The happy couple are stood after the surprise proposal with their two children . 'Then Ben started slowing down and I thought 'oh god he's going to collapse or something'. 'I had no idea what he was planning. 'In hindsight he had suggested before that I wear something nice so we could go out for something to eat afterwards. I should really have twigged when he asked me to take his brogues in the bottom of the pram. 'Who wears brogues after running a marathon?'",

The Spaniard has come in for criticism for persisting with trying to get his side to play out from the back despite results suffering recently. There were even suggestions the players had gone to him asking to play a more direct style but Martinez has always stuck rigidly to his principles, which was the case when he was at Wigan when they were in relegation battles every season.

Everton left-back Leighton Baines comes in with a strong challenge on Southampton forward Shane Long . But while he may persist in wanting to play the same way he said that does not mean his tactics are rigid. 'The people who say that I am tactically not flexible are people who do not follow my work,' Martinez told the Liverpool Echo. 'I have been innovative at every football club I have been at with my tactics, my shape and my approach. 'I am not someone who needs to defend myself but if you follow my work then I am probably one of the most flexible managers tactically that you could work with.' Martinez tinkered with the shape of his side in Saturday's victory over Southampton, their third successive league win, as he switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation with Gareth Barry the solitary holding midfielder with his regular central partner James McCarthy pushed further forward. He explained he made the change to compensate for the absence of leading scorer Romelu Lukaku, who is still recovering from a hamstring injury. 'It was because we didn't have Romelu,' he added. 'In certain games we played with two strikers. On Saturday we had Aaron Lennon really high up the pitch and James McCarthy had freedom. 'Every game is different. Southampton have a very strong back six that needs to be broken in different ways. 'We don't play the same way twice, but it is not for me to go openly and publicly and tell everyone what we have done.' Martinez insists that his tactics are 'innovative' and points to his changes made against Southampton .

A teenager battling bulimia who 'died' on the street from a heart attack was saved by a pair of off-duty police officers who gave her CPR. Hollie Tillbrook, 17, was out with her boyfriend in Basildon's Festival Leisure Park, Essex, when she suddenly collapsed. Doctors believe her potassium levels had plummeted to such a low level that her heart completely stopped. But luckily, two officers, believed to be from the Met Police, rushed to her side and gave Hollie life-saving CPR until an ambulance arrived. She was then rushed to Basildon hospital, where she was put into an induced coma. But the teenager then made an unexpected recovery which stunned medics. She is now recovering at her home in Leigh, Essex, despite her mother Denise Bennett being told to expect the worst. The family are now trying to find the police officers who saved Hollie so they can thank them in person. Hollie said: 'I don't remember much about what happened that day but I owe the doctors and the off-duty officers everything. 'I feel very tired still and I know I have a long recovery ahead. It's been really horrible but I am so thankful to be alive.' Ms Bennett added: 'I would love to be able to meet the police officers who saved my daughter's life and for them to get in touch . 'I really want to thank the two off duty police officers that saved my daughter's life. They are just absolute heroes. 'And also the critical care team at Basildon Hospital - the treatment she received there was brilliant.' The drama unfolded while Hollie was waiting outside the Chiquito's restaurant while her boyfriend Gary Hobbs\u00a0went to park his car. When he came back, he found Hollie laying on the floor with a crowd gathered around her. Ms Bennett then received a phone call, telling her what had happened. The 17-year-old, who suffers with bulimia, had collapsed because she had a dangerous level of potassium in her body. She is now recovering at home with her mother Denise Bennett (right) Humans need potassium in higher amounts than any other mineral. Adults need around 3,500mg in their body per day. Potassium plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acid/alkaline balance of the body. It is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly. It also counterbalances sodium in the body, and is known to help lower blood pressure. To get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium. The Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults (HMSO 1990) showed that the average intake of potassium is 3,187mg in males and 2,434mg in females. Compared with the daily recommendation of 3500mg intakes they are therefore low. People most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly, athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs. Heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake. She said: 'Fortunately a young bouncer working at the park had the presence of mind to take her phone and ring me. 'He said to me \"your daughter has collapsed and is receiving CPR\". I asked if she was responding and he just went quiet and said \"no\". The drive from Leigh to Basildon was awful. It was terrifying.' Hollie was transferred to Basildon Hospital where doctors told Ms Bennett that her heart had stopped. She had technically died for a short time, they said. The teen was then put into an induced coma. Doctors told Ms Bennett to return in the morning but to prepare for the worst. She said: 'I went home to Hollie's bedroom and was just clutching the coat she had been wearing. I was crying and crying.' But, the next morning, doctors began to bring Hollie out of the coma and she started to breathe on her own. Five days later she was allowed home. Ms Bennett said: 'I really want to warn other young people about the effects of bulimia. 'I know it is an illness but it is beyond my comprehension why these kids do this. It is not a game. It can have life-threatening consequences.' Hollie suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which her mother believes caused her to become depressed and develop bulimia. Doctors believe that Hollie had been so sick that her potassium levels had dropped to a dangerous level.",

Results on the pitch \u2013 they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver\u2019s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United .

Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer \u2013 or deflect \u2013 questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James\u2019 Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: \u2018I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,\u2019 he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . \u2018For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. \u2018The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. \u2018Sometimes you\u2019re dealt the hand and you\u2019ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I\u2019ve been dealt. \u2018When I took it on, if I hadn\u2019t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. \u2018And I\u2019ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I\u2019ve got the right tools I can do the job. \u2018But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.\u2019 Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . \u2018I would go to the match because I support the team,\u2019 said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. \u2018I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. \u2018I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. \u2018So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.\u2019 Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .",

A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. He said: 'Combined with the suggestion that boxes may have been on top of the smouldering cigarette, compressing and containing the heat, this made it more likely items would ignite. The salon was totally gutted when an inferno started by a discarded cigarette ripped through it. The 16-year-old girl who started the fire was today told she will not face trial for arson as she had only been 'careless' The family of Stephen Hunt visit the scene where he died. The girl who started the fire is said to have dropped a cigarette while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight . Firefighters enter the remains of music venue NQ Live in Manchester which was also destroyed by the fire (left). Dozens of floral tributes to fireman Stephen Hunt were left at the scene (right) 'It was a hot day and there was a gap beneath the door and as a result experts were unable to exclude a chimney effect as air was drawn under the gap underneath the door and the fire began. 'The conclusion is the Crown's case, which had previously been based on scientific evidence which excluded accidental ignition, can no longer be sustained, so I offer no evidence.' The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Throwing the case out, Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I spent some time reading the papers and reports and it is perfectly obvious this terrible and tragic case demonstrates the danger and potential danger from discarded cigarettes. A fireman patrols the scene in Manchester's Northern Quarter where his colleague was killed. More than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral . More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as passers-by watched on . 'This was discarded without any thought and as a result a fire started in circumstances which were particular to the site in question, resulting in extensive damage and costing the life of a man who, as part of his employment, was there to protect life and property. 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.' In September 2013 more than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral. In a tribute to him at his funeral, his son Sam said: 'To me, he wasn't just my dad but my hero, my role model and my best friend.' Following the hearing today, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We have made no comment on any aspect of the incident and are unlikely to do so until the coroner's inquest into Stephen's death has concluded. 'Safe to say we continue to work with everyone involved in various investigations to find the truth of what happened, not least for Stephen's family but for everyone involved and especially our firefighters.'",

In spite of the defeat which prompted her predecessor's resignation, the SNP leader has racked up support across Scotland since, with some fans even hopeful of a victory on May 7. But weeks after having to deny allegations of back-room plotting against Ed Miliband, Mrs Sturgeon has been rocked by more smearing claims yet. For with just two weeks to go until she canvasses polling station queues, the 44-year-old has been accused of savage violence. The SNP leader (pictured right, aged 14) has denied her sister's claims she used to shave the heads off her sister's Barbie dolls . According to her sister, Gillian Owens, the politician was prone to hacking the hair of from dolls as a child. 'She once cut the hair off my Sindy doll, just for fun,' Gillian Owens, a part-time actress, said. Rebutting the claims, the politician told the BBC: 'I deny the allegations levelled at me by my sister. 'I'm sure I didn't cut the hair off her Barbie doll. 'But if I did it - and it's an \"if\" - then there would have been provocation involved, I'm sure of it.' Later posting on Twitter, she added: 'For the record I think my sister is misremembering. I'm sure it was a Sindy doll. #dollgate.' Poking fun at the tale, she told one follower: 'I'm not proud of it... but I've changed. My niece's have never come to any harm.' The accusations sparked a Twitter trend with internet users sharing mocking photographs of beheaded Barbie dolls on Saturday afternoon. The politician poked fun at her sister's claims which sparked a Twitter trend on Saturday afternoon . Twitter users were quick to join in on the joke, sharing photographs of beheaded dolls on the social network . One user shared this photograph of the SNP leader as a murderous doll herself, holding a pair of scissors . A joke Twitter account was set up in the name Barbie Sturgeon in the wake of the claims this weekend . In an interview with The Sun, Mrs Sturgeon's sister told of how they were 'like chalk and cheese' growing up. 'I was into dolls and everything girly. Nicola was into sitting reading. She was a very strong-minded wee girl.' Polls suggest the SNP is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern British politics, winning as many as 50 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Commons seats. That would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at Westminster for the first time. Mrs Sturgeon did not attend a ceremony at the Cenotaph this morning with other party leaders to commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli Landings. Laying a wreath a Scottish memorial site instead she later attended an SNP women's rally in Glasgow City Centre. The SNP leader skipped the Cenotaph ceremony to join female voters in central Glasgow at a women's rally .",

Called High There!, the app is officially described as the world\u2019s first global social network for cannabis enthusiasts. The network is designed to let users meet one another online to make friends and form relationships without being judged for their habit or views. The High There! app is  described as the world\u2019s first global social network of cannabis enthusiasts. Users share their interests (left) and energy levels when using cannabis (right) as part of their profile . When High There! first launched two months ago, it could only be downloaded by users in the US who live in states that have legalised cannabis. But now it\u2019s available globally via Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play, after getting approval to widen its reach. The app quickly became popular in New York, California and Colorado, with 41,000 downloads in the first six weeks and it\u2019s expected to a hit in the Netherlands, Spain, England and Australia, Forbes reported. Users swipe to choose to connect to people - like in the popular dating app Tinder. When High There! first launched two months ago, it could only be downloaded by users in the US who live in states that have legalised cannabis (a joint is pictured) but a global version was rolled out yesterday . The medicinal properties of hemp are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs. Hemp is legal and unlike cannabis, contains little tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high. There are a rising number of firms in the US that sell biscuits containing cannabidiol extracted from hemp, believed to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help animals lose weight. Research has also suggested that CBD can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs. 'Due in part to their small body size, dogs and cats can take advantage of small amounts of CBD, THC and other cannabinoids found in hemp and can therefore reap the benefits of this great plant,' the firm said. 'We are not interested in, nor are we advocating the administration of, the well-known psychotropic compound THC, in concentrations sufficient to produce the 'high' or psychotropic effects which are normally associated with marijuana. 'We are not advocating the administration of marijuana, by any route, to animals in order to produce medical benefit or to produce any psychotropic effect.' The firm writes on the App Store: 'Chat with your connections and invite your friends who also want to engage in shared experiences within a non-judgmental environment. 'You can use High There! to date, go out with new friends, or simply connect with people who are like you. As we say, \u201cYou've got more friends than you think.\u201d' Denver-based Founder and CEO of High There! Todd Mitchem, said that the app doesn\u2019t encourage the sale of marijuana but is simply a social network for people who consider it part of their lifestyle. It deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana in their picture section. Despite the measures, Mr Mitchem said he was surprised that the app was allowed to go global. Writing on the High There!\u00a0blog, he said: \u2018This news was a surprise, but the allowance was made because we are a responsible social network and because we focus on building connections rather than just showing off your weed.\u2019 He\u2019s a former Chief Revenue Officer of hash oil maker, O.penVAPE and says that 12 million people use some form of the drug, meaning that there is a real opportunity to connect users on a social network. His motivation for rolling out the app widely is personal too, because his mother used the drug to battle cancer, which Mr Mitchem claims saved her life. \u2018To you, that mother just like mine, fighting cancer in a state where the stigma still exists around weed, High There! is here for you. His motivation for rolling out the app globally (illustrated with this image) is personal for Mr Mitchem, because his mother used to drug to battle cancer, which he claims saved her life . The app deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana (a stock image is shown) in their picture section . \u2018To all of you in states where cannabis is now legal, High There! is definitely here for you too! \u2018And to the countless women and men who simply want to meet other like-minded, amazing people in a non-judgmental way, High There! is here for you also.\u2019 The app has been likened to Tinder, which also lets users swipe through prospective friends and partners. At its regional launch,\u00a0Mashable reported that Mr Mitchem created the app after women didn\u2019t find him appealing on conventional dating sites, because he smokes cannabis. \u2018We wanted to build a cool piece of technology that solved the problem of where do million and millions of cannabis consumers go to meet people, connect with people and build relationships,\u2019 he said. \u2018A lot of people say we\u2019re the Tinder of weed, but that\u2019s only one facet of the whole thing. It\u2019s so much bigger. He says the network is actually primarily designed for platonic connections. \u2018As we open the platform to the entire planet, I am certain meeting new like-minded people will take on some exciting new paths,\u2019 he added.",

The crash at an intersection in Redford, Detroit, flipped Mrs Weatherhead's vehicle and killed her on October 6 last year. Francesca Weatherhead (pictured) was killed when parolee John McCallum collided with her vehicle while fleeing police . McCallum (left) was sentenced to 20 - 45 years' in jail for the killing of Francesca Weatherhead, who had only months before married her college sweetheart Matthew (pictured together right) Her death caused outrage when it was revealed McCallum had been paroled not five months prior - despite being sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison on his latest break-in and drug possession arrest. He had first been eligible for parole in September 2013 but was held longer because authorities thought he needed to complete a violence prevention program. Yet he was released just months later, after the Michigan Department of Corrections decided he successfully passed the program. During sentencing on Tuesday, McCallum told Mrs Weatherhead's husband he thought of what happened every day from inside his jail cell. He said: 'If I could have avoided the death of her, I would have. I would like to say I'm sorry,' the Detroit Free Press reported. Despite his contrition,\u00a0Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway sentenced him to 20-45 years in prison after he struck a plea deal with prosecutors in which charges of home invasion and reckless driving causing death were dropped. Mrs Weatherhead was driving to her job as a sales manager when McCallum ran a red light in his Ford Escape and struck her car. Francesca and Matthew Weatherhead pose for an engagement photo. The couple married in June but she was killed only months later . The two met at Michigan State University, where Matthew Weatherhead was going to medical school . She had married Matthew Weatherhead in June, and was putting her husband through medical school at MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. Mrs Weatherhead graduated from Trenton High School, where she played softball and was named homecoming queen. She went on to attend Michigan State University and graduated in 2010 with a degree in business administration and marketing. Her family previously expressed their dismay at losing such a beloved family member, The News Herald reported. Her younger sister Nina Vitale said: 'Words cannot express what an overwhelming feeling it is to lose someone so close to you. 'She was more than a daughter, sister, wife or friend. She was our strength and we are lost without her.' Mr Weatherhead told the court his partner was a wonderful wife and would have been a great mother .",

The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for\u00a0Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game,\u00a0USA Today\u00a0reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday.

Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.'

'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr. The internet connection at Cobb's Portsmouth home was identified as the origin of the images. Cobb was in the US working as a  director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island\u00a0after holding senior military and government roles in Australia, including the RAAF . Laptops and mobile phones were seized from his home, while photos and videos of two females were also discovered on a storage device and a computer allegedly belonging to Cobb. Educated at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and University of Cambridge, Cobb built a reputation as a leading military thinker. According to his biography on the US Naval War College website, Cobb worked on the 1999-2000 East Timor crisis with Major General Cosgrove, who at the time was commander of the international peacekeeping mission. 'Overall, my commanders and I found Dr Cobb's work a valuable contribution to our understanding of important issues before us,' Maj Gen Cosgrove wrote in a review of Cobb's work as lead analyst for the Australian Parliament Defence Office. In Australia he was special-director, strategic policy with the RAAF; senior defence adviser for the Australian parliament; an Australian parliamentary fellow; and research fellow at Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre. Cobb has also worked at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC and was on the staff of former speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Dr Adam Cobb had worked for the federal government, the Royal Australian Air Force and Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove (pictured) in East Timor .",

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that the Washington Supreme Court did not act unreasonably when it rejected Clark Elmore\u2019s claim his constitutional rights were violated at trial. Elmore, who was convicted of killing Kristy Ohnstad in Bellingham\u00a0after he said she threatened to reveal he had molested her as a child, received the federal court's ruling on Wednesday. Clark Elmore\u2019s conviction for killing and raping his 14-year-old stepdaughter in Washington in 1995 was upheld . The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the Washington Supreme Court's (above) decision was correct . Ohnstad, a middle school student, was the daughter of Elmore\u2019s live-in girlfriend, the Seattle Times reported. After she went missing, Elmore pretended he was grieving and helped organize a search party to find her. Elmore is the second-longest serving inmate on the state's death row after being sent there in 1996 . He eventually admitted killing her in a graphic taped confession. Elmore claimed his rights were violated during the trial because his attorney gave him bad advice and the jury saw him in shackles. The three-member panel's ruling against the 63-year-old convict was unanimous. The panel wrote: 'We hold that the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of Elmore\u2019s constitutional claims was not unreasonable. 'The district court did not err in denying Clark Elmore\u2019s challenges to his conviction and death sentence, and we therefore affirm the district court's decision. 'Clark Elmore committed a truly monstrous crime. 'A state that has chosen to impose the death penalty can surely reserve it for such an offense.' The ruling does not mean Elmore will now be executed as Governor Jay Inslee has declared a moratorium on the death penalty. Elmore is the second-longest serving inmate on the state\u2019s death row - he arrived there in 1996 - although he is now effectively serving a life sentence due to the moratorium on executions. He may still ask the US Supreme Court to review the 9th Circuit court\u2019s opinion .",

Like Paul, the Kentucky senator who made a name for himself by\u00a0championing issues not typically associated with the GOP such as criminal justice reform and privacy protections, much of the 'Rand' 2016 SWAG is unconventional. Rand fans will still find the usual array of yard signs and bumper stickers. But they'll also have the opportunity to sport their support  through Macbook skins and woven blankets that feature Paul's face, 'Stand with Rand' flip-flops and car mats and a host of other unique items like the 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker.' Scroll down for video . Libertarian icon Rand Paul has expanded his campaign store to include an array of unconventional SWAG, including the 'Rand on a Stick' item feature above, as he kicks off his presidential campaign . An ophthalmologist by trade, the store contains eye charts bearing Paul's name and his campaign slogan because 'we need a president who can see clearly,' as the site states . For $75 Paul fans can own a throw rug featuring the Kentucky senator. It also comes in a Constitution theme for the same price . 'Sure it might be fun to have Rand in your living room at night engaging in deep discussions about objectivism, libertarianism, conservatism and a few other isms,' the description for the item reads. 'In the absence of that, curl up on your couch with the Rand blanket. It's the next best thing to him being there.' The freshman senator's expansion of his campaign store to include 'Paul for president' items preceded an announcement this morning on the website that said: 'I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government.' An unofficial candidate for the last year, the statement made formal the tea partier's entry into the 2016 contest a few hours before he was scheduled to hold a campaign kick-off in his home state. He'll spend the rest of the week rallying supporters in early presidential primary states New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada, in that order, before making his back to Washington for his day job. The Senate is currently in the midst of a two-week break in honor of the Easter and Passover holidays. Loyalists of the 52-year-old freshman senator and his father Ron, a former Texas representative who sought the presidency in 2008 and 2012, are known for the fervency of their support and organizational skills. Tonight they'll celebrate the younger Paul's entry into 2016 competition with 'Stand with Rand' #LibertyKaraoke parties across the country. Running on the slogan 'Defeat the Washington Machine, Unleash the American Dream' and promoting himself as 'A Different Kind of Republican,' Paul's campaign store reflects the 52-year-old lawmaker's efforts to appeal to a new generation of conservatives- fiercely independent young adults who are just as likely to vote for GOP politicians as they are Libertarian candidates or nobody at all. Playing off the Stand with Rand theme, the description accompanying a pair of $20 sandals in the store says, 'no, really stand with Rand in official campaign flip flops.' Beer steins and t-shirts rock an 'unleashed' dog wearing patriotic sunglasses and holding an American flag in his mouth. The item bound to draw the most attention, however, is the campaign's 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker' that allegedly protects users from the preying eyes of the government. 'That little front facing camera on your laptop or tablet can be a window for the world to see you - whether you know it or not!' the item's page warns . For $100 Paul's supporters can purchase branded versions of cornhall, the bean bag toss game that's especially popular with the southerners from Paul's native region . And for $1,000 they can become the owner of an autographed Rand Paul pocket Constitution. 'It's size is perfect for comfortable carrying in the pocket of a sport coat, a purse, laptop bag or in the back pocket of some worn out jeans,' the site says .

And there's the 'Rand on a Stick' posters of Paul's head, attached to a stick. 'Sure, there are a lot of things you can get on a stick, but can you get the next leader of the free world on a stick? Huh? 'These Rand Paul freedom paddles are printed on sturdy corrugated plastic and are great for rallies, parades, meetings, operas, church services that lack air conditioning and so much more,' the description reads.

The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside\u00a0Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate\u00a0as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.",

The former prime minister also suggested he has left British politics behind, declaring that he has 'done British' and is now more interested in working at a 'global level'. Claiming the money he generates pays for the 'infrastructure' around him, Mr Blair said: 'I could not do what I do unless I was also able to generate income'. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has denied he is super-rich after joined the election campaign for Labour . He added: 'Am I better off than most people? Yeah, I'm very lucky. Am I in the league of the super-rich? Absolutely not, though you will have to make up your own mind about that.' Mr Blair, who entered the general election fray for Labour this week, spoke about his multi-million pound earnings in an interview with\u00a0Newsweek magazine. Mr Blair earns millions of pounds a year from his consultancy roles and charges fees of \u00a3250,000 for public speaking. Tony Blair spoke about his multi-million pound earnings in an interview with Newsweek magazine . Since leaving Number Ten in 2007, he has established up a complex network of companies, which make it impossible to calculate his exact earnings. He rarely discusses his wealth, though he has dismissed reports he has amassed \u00a3100 million as 'greatly exaggerated', and his allies say he has given millions of pounds to charity. Mr Blair has suggested that in fact, he is worth less than \u00a320million, though he and his family are thought to own property worth at least \u00a330million. His five-storey central London home, and its accompanying mews house is thought to be worth at least \u00a35million, while his Grade I-listed manor house in Buckinghamshire, once owned by Sir John Gielgud, is thought to be worth a similar amount. He and wife Cherie own a further seven properties. Mr Blair, who has been criticised for accepting advisory roles to foreign governments with dubious human rights records, insisted: 'I decided a long time ago that it's whether I'm doing the right thing or the wrong thing. 'If it's the right thing I'm doing, then I should be doing it even if I am being attacked for it.' Asked why he works mainly outside his home country, Mr Blair said: 'I've done British. I suppose where I think I can make most difference is a global level, working on things that had interested me as Prime Minister but was not able to devote myself to in the same way.' Tony Blair bought this Grade II listed Georgian town house in 2004 in central London worth more than \u00a36m . The family purchased the mews house at the rear of their central London property worth approximately \u00a31m . Mr Blair and his wife bought this Grade I listed mansion South Pavilion in Wooton Underwood in Buckinghamshire, once owned by Sir John Gielgud which has ncreased in value to almost \u00a38 million . In what may be interpreted as criticism of Mr Miliband, as well as other political leaders, he warned that the 'centre ground is not leading strongly'. As well as the buy-to-let flats in the North West, the Blairs have a considerable portfolio of private homes for themselves and their children. One of Tony and Cherie\u2019s two London properties is a \u00a38 million five-storey Georgian townhouse, which they bought in 2004. Three years later they snapped up the \u00a3800,000 mews house behind it \u2013 and have since paid off the mortgage. In 2008 they bought a \u00a35.75million Grade I listed Buckinghamshire manor house - now worth in the region of \u00a38 million. A \u00a31.35million four-storey Georgian property in the capital was bought for son Nicky, 28, last year \u2013 paid for in cash. And the couple also paid \u00a3600,000 in cash for a three-bedroom cottage in Buckinghamshire for Mr Blair\u2019s sister Sarah the same year. They also purchased a \u00a33.62million townhouse in the capital for Euan and his wife Suzanne. The \u00a31.2million mews property behind it was bought for daughter Kathryn. 'Then you get what I would say are basically quack remedies being peddled by the more extreme versions of left or right. Practical evidence-based solutions get squeezed out in favour of policy positions that can be emotionally attractive but practically foolish or even dangerous,' he added. 'You can see this in the debates around immigration, particularly\u2026. Patriotism is a great thing, but nationalism, especially of the narrow, partisan sort, always has real danger lurking underneath it\u2026 . 'One of the attractions of what I would call a Putin model of leadership is that in an era where the political leaders [are] to be hesitant about big positions, you've got somebody who is taking big positions. 'Now, I would not agree with those positions. But the attraction of that as a model, which is why a lot of these people like [Marine] le Pen and [Nigel] Farage and people praise him, is that there appears to be certainty about the solution. It's not a solution I would agree with. But it's interesting to reflect upon that.' Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said: 'First we had 'Two Kitchens Miliband' lecturing people from his \u00a32 million mansion and now multi-millionaire Tony Blair declaring he doesn't think he is \"super-rich\". 'It shows just how out of touch the champagne socialists at the top of the Labour Party are.' As well as the townhouse the Blairs purchased in 2004 and the country estate the couple bought in 2008, the family own at least four other large properties around London. They have made an estimated \u00a35million from increases in the values of their properties, as well as around \u00a3100,000-a-year in rent from the flats they own in Manchester and Bristol. The Blairs bought the second of two flats in Bristol for \u00a3265,000\u00a0in 2002 with help of  Peter Foster . The two Victorian villas in Urmston, Manchester, have been converted into flats and sold to Mrs Blair and her son for \u00a3650,000 .",

Farage, the leader of  the UK Independence Party (UKIP), complains that Britain's membership of the European Union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants, many from impoverished Eastern Europe, into his \"small island\" nation. In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain. \"The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr. Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40,\" Zylinksi said. Holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a  World War II war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet. \"Enough is enough, Mr. Farage. So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"I would like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would traditionally do. \"Are you up for it Mr. Farage?\" Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince. \"It is an impressive sword. I don't have one but I'm sure we could find one if we had to. But I'm not intending to accept the offer,\" a spokesman quoted him as saying. \"I would have thought that a Polish prince with a long Polish lineage would rather agree with me that it's a complete tragedy for Poland that it's lost so many of its brightest and best young people.\" UKIP wants Britain to leave the European Union. It says it would not seek to remain a party to the region's free trade or economic treaties \"while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor, which prevents the UK managing its own borders.\" It has also pledged to cut the country's \u00a39 billion ($12.4B) annual foreign aid budget. Another UKIP politician appeared to back his party leader's chances in a duel, tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two, with the comment: \"This is what Nigel would do to him.\" But there was no word on whether Farage would even accept the prince's less life-threatening back-up challenge. \"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections,\" Zylinski suggested. \"I'm up for it, it would be really nice, hopefully you will agree.\" Zylinski posted a separate video on YouTube entitled \"7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,\" in which he pointed to a Times newspaper headline from March reading: \"We need more migrants ... they are the best workers in Britain.\" The headline, he said, applied \"principally\" to the Poles. \"What I cannot accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the Poles. Enough is enough, I say, this has got to stop.\" Zylinski pointed to Polish contributions to Britain including  those made by Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, what he said was a \"wonderful work ethic\" and easy integration into the community. \"We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know,\" he said. \"We are very grateful to be here. We would like you to be grateful too. Please stop knocking the Poles. We love this country we would like British to love us too.\"",

Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was meant to ink 'Riley' - the name of his four-year-old son - into his left arm.

The makeshift tattoo session took place in Mr Moffatt's living room with a \u00a370 ink gun bought online. The NHS worker was drunk at the time and said he now considers the inkwork a 'nightmare'. He said: 'I'd never picked up a tattoo gun in my life and I got told by my brother not to do, but I just didn't listen. 'Now, my family are always saying \"you're an idiot, Tom\" and there are plenty of jokes at my expense from my mates. I can't repeat what they say about it. 'I have to hide my arm when I go for interviews. Even Riley has started to notice and points at those tattoos and says \"daddy, I don't like those ones\". It's a nightmare.' Among his homegrown tattoos, Mr Moffatt also has a wonky cross on his forearm, which he drew just a few months after Riley's birth in 2012. He has just endured his second hour-long laser removal session in a bid to get rid of the botched needlework.

He said: 'I've got a long journey ahead of me to get them all off and I pressed it so deep in one that it's going to be very difficult to get it off.' Mr Moffatt, who also has a two-year-old daughter Kya with partner Rachael Higgins, 23, now wants to use his experience to highlight why people should not attempt to draw their own tattoos. He said: 'Once I've got them off, my job isn't done. We want to try and get a campaign going so people like me can't just go out and buy a gun with no questions asked. 'You shouldn't be able to go on the internet as a 15-year-old Joe Bloggs and buy one. I want to get the message out there that tattoos should only be done by professionals.' The owner of the Maria Patricia Tattoo Removals, where he is being treated, says Mr Moffatt's situation is a stark warning against the dangers of unregulated ink work. Maria said: 'There needs to be more regulation. People don't realise the dangers of the buying off tattoo guns and ink off the internet. 'Tom did just that and had to Google the instructions of how to use it. It might seem like a laugh with mates when you're drunk but it's not easy to fix the damage and people can be left with scarring if they're not careful. 'We're all for tattoos but people need to be aware they can wreck lives and make it difficult to get jobs.' Mr Moffatt, a machine operator working on NHS hospital equipment,\u00a0will appear in Tattoo Disasters UK, which airs each Tuesday, new and exclusive to Spike.",

CCTV footage from one of the raids in Tipton, West Midlands, shows the gang using umbrellas to conceal their entrance as they burst into a supermarket, where they stole cash from the offices. Scroll down for video . Umbrella thieves: A gang of armed robbers used pink brollies to confuse staff as they raided 13 shops in a two-month crime spree in the West Midlands . The gang  also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives and screwdrivers, before punching one employee in the face. In a separate raid, the men stole the store manager's Mercedes E200 which they used as their getaway car. The group have now been jailed for more than 27 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob. Police caught the thieves following a raid on an Asda supermarket in Coseley, West Midlands, where they were armed with hammers and what was reported to be a gun in a plastic bag. Detectives then used forensic evidence found on the weapon to link the various burglaries, before executing search warrants on the homes of the four suspects. During the searches, police found fluorescent jackets, identical to those used in the raids, along with banks statements showing large transfers of cash. Armed:\u00a0The gang also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives, golf clubs and screwdrivers . They also discovered numerous cash bags from a shop known as Farmfords, one of those targeted by the group, as well as \u00a32,500 in cash. Mobile phones found at the addresses also showed several calls made between the group, while number plate analysis linked the defendants to the areas where the crimes had been committed. Liam Bell, 19, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, and 22-year-old Trea Richardson, from Hansworth, were arrested in June last year, at the time of the warrants being executed. Marcus Morgan, 21, from Tividale, West Midlands, went on the run for five months before being detained in November. Guilty: Ashleigh Evans, 26 (left) from West Bromwich and Marcus Morgan, 21 (right) from Tividale, West Midlands, were jailed for ten years and seven years respectively for their parts in the 13 robberies . Jailed: Liam Bell, 19 (left), from Rowley Regis was jailed for six years and six months while Trea Richardson, 22 (right) from Hansowrth, was sentened to a four-year jail term . Ashleigh Evans, 26, from West Bromwich, was arrested on a flight back from Amsterdam. Officers even found the umbrella captured on CCTV in his luggage. On Friday, Evans was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Bell was jailed for six years and six months. Richardson received a four-year jail term while Morgan was sentenced to seven years. Sentencing Morgan, Recorder William Mousley QC said to Morgan: 'No doubt you would have seen the fear in the eyes of the people you were robbing yet you carried on thereafter. 'It was not a one-off, it was a course of conduct you decided to engage in quite freely for a few weeks. 'This was professional, commercial robbery for significant financial gain where people were disguised and premises targeted that were vulnerable where people worked hard for not much money. 'They were not the type of premises where workers would expect people like you to come in and rob the store. The only mitigation I can find other than your guilty plea is your youth.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Rich Whitehouse, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The money and value of goods stolen, while significant, is nothing compared to the impact these offences have had on the staff members of the targeted premises. 'These offences were carefully planned and the group went to great lengths to conceal their involvement, often using umbrellas as cover when walking from the street to the shops, so as not to draw attention to their face coverings. 'However, the more offences they committed the more arrogant they became. There was also a clear escalation in the type of weapons used in the robberies and I am in no doubt they would have gone on to seriously hurt someone had they not been stopped.'",

A voyeur who used a hidden camera to film up women's skirts as they bent over freezers in Lidl has been spared jail. James Webster targeted\u00a0female shoppers at the Lidl store in Maidenhead, Berkshire, as they hunted for bargains in the large chest freezers. The 35-year-old was caught after attracting the attention of a fellow shopper, who spotted him moving the bag he was carrying closer to his unsuspecting victim. Security guards discovered Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could carry out his covert filming. He admitted outraging public decency at a previous hearing and was warned that he could face prison. But Webster walked free from court after magistrates sitting in Slough, Berkshire, ordered him to complete a sexual offences treatment programme, as part of a three year community order. Opening the case, Helen Gambrill said: 'On January 12 the defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead and outraged the public decency, namely filming up the skirts of women in that store. 'That offence came to light when a member of the public saw the defendant and thought he was acting in a strange way.' The court heard the shopper spotted Webster positioning his satchel, with a lens protruding out, under the skirt of a woman. Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing. However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper he turned himself in to police. Webster  immediately showed remorse, telling a police officer, 'I threw the camera away in frustration on the day I did this.' He accepted that his actions had a sexual purpose but admitted he had no idea why he had carried out the crime. Francis Domingo, defending, said Webster had been struggling to deal with a break-up at the time and was incredibly ashamed at his actions. 'From the moment I've seen him, I can tell you this - Mr Webster has expressed nothing but sincere remorse over what took place,' he said. Webster, now of Fengate, Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean, the court was told. Webster had targeted women as the shopped at Lidl in Maidenhead, Berkshire (pictured) Sentencing him, Presiding magistrate Mark Lovett said: 'We note the early guilty plea and the fact that you were very upfront about it from the very beginning. 'You were remorseful for your actions. 'On the other hand, you did show obvious intention - you went equipped. This was hardly accidental.' He added: 'The other point I have to make is that you're not 18, you're 35, for goodness sake. 'That kind of action from someone of your mature years is quite extraordinary.' Webster was handed a three year community order  and was ordered to take part in a sexual offences treatment programme. He was also told to pay \u00a385 in costs and a \u00a360 fine.",

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

David and Margaret-Ann Rous were on an Easter getaway when their private plane crashed into hills during bad weather in the Scottish highlands. The pair had arranged a secret visit using Mr Rous\u2019s light aircraft to see his wife\u2019s mother and sister on an island in the Inner Hebrides on Saturday. Newlyweds: Dr Margaret-Ann and David Rous died when their light aircraft crashed into a Scottish hillside while flying from their home in Dundee to make a surprise to see family on the the Hebridean isle of Tiree . Tragedy: The couple \u2013\u00a0who had been married for less than a year \u2013 were found in the wreckage of the aircraft . But when the couple failed to turn up at the island\u2019s airstrip and radar contact could not be made with the plane, a search party was scrambled. The wreckage of the plane and the couple\u2019s bodies were found in hills in Argyll six hours later as aviation experts said the flight may have encountered poor visibility. Shocked residents on the island of Tiree paid tribute to the \u2018wonderful\u2019 Dr Rous, 37, who had been married to the 28-year-old structural engineer for three years. The couple, who are understood to have been planning a family and to move into a larger property, can be seen revelling in married life in photographs posted online. Alongside images of their honeymoon in Venice, one poignant photograph, posted only months before the crash, shows the smiling couple wearing headsets in a plane cockpit. Dr Rous\u2019s sister Johann yesterday described the GP as her \u2018absolute rock\u2019, and said learning about the crash led to \u2018the hardest day of my life\u2019. Dr Rous met her husband when he visited Tiree, where she grew up, several years ago. Lives cut short: It is understood the couple were moving to a larger house and were planning to start a family . The couple lived in a \u00a3260,000 semi-detached house in Newport-on-Tay, just across the river from Dundee where Dr Rous worked as a family doctor. Neighbours said that despite Mr Rous often working away from home, the couple frequently held parties for them to make friends. Dr John Holliday, Tiree\u2019s local doctor for almost 30 years, said: \u2018I had known Margaret-Ann since the 1980s. She captivated everyone that knew her. She was absolutely gorgeous in every way. She became a much-loved GP in Dundee and I have no doubt that she was a wonderful doctor with her charm and great empathy. Surprise visit to see family: The couple were flying in Mr Rous's Piper Cherokee from Dundee, where they lived, to Tiree, where Dr Rous grew up, to spend the weekend with her mother and sister . Scouring the landscape: A Coastguard search and rescue helicopter, a Royal Navy helicopter from HMS Gannet and an air ambulance were all scrambled to make a search after radar contact with the plane was lost . \u2018She immediately touched the hearts of everyone who came into contact with her.\u2019 Paying tribute to Mr Rous, originally from Gillingham in Kent, he added: \u2018He was a really nice man and a very talented structural engineer with a bright professional career ahead of him. \u2018Together they made a fine couple. We can only imagine what the family must be suffering. \u2018A cloud has fallen over Tiree, but the island community will come together as it always does at times like this.\u2019 Private jet: The couple were flying in a Piper Cherokee light aircraft (like the one above) when tragedy struck . The tragedy unfolded after the couple set off from Dundee Airport in Mr Rous\u2019s single-engine Piper Cherokee plane on Saturday. Radar contact was lost at around 1.50pm as they travelled over the remote Beinn nan Lus area of Glen Kinglass. Coastguard and Royal Navy helicopters, as well as an air ambulance, were called, and found the wreckage at 8pm on the northern side of Glen Kinglass, above Loch Etive. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is now examining possible causes of the crash. Local aviation expert David Howitt said that the conditions were poor at the time, adding: \u2018I have been taking weather readings here for 50 years, and on Saturday the weather was very, very dubious. There was some very poor visibility.\u2019 Iain MacKinnon, part of the coastguard team that searched the area, said: \u2018At the loch surface it was almost perfect visibility, but in terms of using the rescue helicopters they were very restricted.\u2019",

Ahead of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix he said: 'You want to know what I said to Kimi? Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene (right) speaks to his drivers Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel (left) Vettel celebrates after beating Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . 'He was telling me about the contract and I said to him, 'It depends on your performance'. 'And Kimi, he's the kind of person who appreciates when you're talking with him in a very transparent way and straight to his face. 'Kimi knows it's early to talk about this at the moment, but I'm happy about the performance, he just needs to push and he knows that.'",

A 26-year-old man wanted for the\u00a0murder of his mother and sister has been arrested\u00a0after being spotted by a member of the public. Peter Fox, from Liverpool, was arrested at Euston Station in London\u00a0this morning on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette, 57, and Sarah Fox, 27, following a nationwide manhunt. Detectives released CCTV images of the 26-year-old  leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm on Wednesday and arriving at Euston railway station in the capital at 10.57pm. The body of his sister  was found by police on Thursday night, just hours before her 57-year-old mother Bernadette was found dead at sheltered accommodation just half a mile away in Bootle, Merseyside. Merseyside Police said Mrs Fox died of asphyxiation, while her daughter was repeatedly stabbed. Bernadette and Sarah's family today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Rooney from Merseyside Police said: 'I can confirm that a 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette and Sarah Fox this morning and is being brought back to Merseyside. 'A significant amount of work has been carried out over the weekend with the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police and I would like to thank them for their assistance. 'I would also like to thank the media and the public for their support during the weekend, which has helped us enormously.' In a statement issued through police, a spokesman for the Fox family said: 'We are absolutely devastated following the loss of Bernadette and Sarah and are still trying to come to terms with what has happened to them both. The family of Bernadette (left) and Sarah (right) have said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss . 'Bernadette, who was a mother of three and grandmother of three, was a very outgoing and lovely person who wouldn't harm anyone. In fact she only ever had nice things to say about people. She was so caring and would help anyone. 'And Sarah was loved by her family and well-liked by her friends and neighbours. She was a fantastic aunty and was a cheeky, bubbly and outgoing person who loved her dog. They will both be greatly missed. 'We would ask that people appreciate that this is a sad and tragic time for the family and that we are left alone to grieve in peace, whilst we try to understand what has happened.' The family urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police to help them 'find justice for Bernadette and Sarah'. Sarah Fox's body was found around 9pm on Thursday night after police received a phone call about her welfare. A neighbour had reportedly raised the alarm after seeing a dog loose on the streets. Detectives released CCTV images of Peter Fox arriving at Euston Station (right) in the capital at around 10.57pm on Wednesday night after leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm (left) Another neighbour living close to the flat, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw one of my neighbours in the street who said he was worried after he noticed the dog from the flat roaming the streets, he had seen it a few times so he knocked on the door but got no answer. 'He called to the house last night and noticed there was a downstairs window open and the back door was ajar.' It was then that the police were called and officers found Sarah Fox's body, who they said had suffered 'multiple injuries'. 'It's so shocking. I've spoken to the girl from those flats before two or three times, she seemed a nice girl,' the neighbour added. Bernadette Fox was found when police arrived at her address through other enquiries. One neighbour near the sheltered housing property, who did wish to be named, said: 'The girl's name was Sarah - people called her Foxy - and her mum was Bernie. Police launched a double murder inquiry after the bodies of two women were found at separate addresses in Bootle, Merseyside. Pictured, officers outside a property in Worcester Road . Sarah Fox, 27, was found dead with multiple injuries at around 9pm on Thursday evening, after police were called to Worcester Road (pictured) over concerns for her welfare . 'Bernie was harmless and Sarah I think had worked at a solicitors nearby, Bernie had a son as well. 'The place where Bernie lived was sheltered accommodation and it had cameras all over the place. 'There's a camera over the intercom so anyone letting someone in would see them. It's a hard place to get into.' Martin Stevenson, Director of Older People's Services at Your Housing Group, said yesterday: 'Tragically a body was discovered at one of our Roger Arden Court sheltered scheme apartments in Bootle this morning. 'Merseyside Police attended the incident and we are continuing to support them with their investigations. 'Our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the deceased at this difficult time.' Patricia Doragh, who lives in a property near the flat, said: 'It is quite a rough area around here especially up the side streets. 'The police are always up and down the main road it's not a rare thing, it's a street quite well known for alcohol. 'When I took my grandsons out earlier about 12 o'clock there was nothing here and now all the cordons are up.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation. 'I want to reinforce the message that you should be abiding by directions, if the train station is closed, you don't climb over onto railway tracks, It is a shame that people have taken it upon themselves to do so on this occasion.'",

In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It's very, very dangerous. It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.",

Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: \"I think it's time.\" 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I\u2019m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'",

The new policy allows for an American traveler who has been denied boarding a commercial airliner to petition the U.S. Transportation Security Administration once to find out whether he or she is on the no-fly list and a second time for an unclassified explanation of why he or she is on the list. In some cases, the government will not be able to provide an explanation because of national security concerns. The changes partially lift a veil of secrecy enshrouding a policy that has been a centerpiece of the government's counterterrorism efforts since the September 2001 terror attacks. Grounded or not grounded? Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the U.S. Above the security line at New York John F Kennedy International Airport in October . But the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit, said the changes don't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to, including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it. The explanations provided to six travelers so far, which were mandated by a federal judge, have been inadequate, the ACLU said. For instance, in a letter to New Jersey resident Amir Meshal, the government's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the FBI obtained from Meshal when he was detained in Africa in 2007, ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said. The ACLU considers Meshal's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse. 'From the face of the letter, a neutral decision-maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred,' said Shamsi. The Justice Department declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said, 'We are committed to a process that protects Americans from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties.' Last fall, there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, according to the government. Typically, less than 5 per cent of those on the list are Americans. The list fluctuates in size. Previously, the government's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list, citing national security concerns. In most instances, travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they can't board their flights. Travelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007. Only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list, the government has said. The TSA gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year, and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no-fly list, said Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron. In 2014, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list of their status on the list, and seven were told they were not on the list. The government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no-fly list, including Meshal. One of the explanations included just a 'single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country,' according a court document filed earlier this year. The letters to the six plaintiffs on the no-fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs' reputations, Shamsi said. 'The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again,' Shamsi said. The TSA will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy. The changes are not yet in effect, and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the Portland lawsuit, but the Homeland Security Department said it expects them be in place soon. Catron said individual requests should take months to process, not years. 'These enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within, or bound for, the United States,' Catron said.",

The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to \u00a330,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as\u00a0The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down. It was replaced by The Bristol Brewery Georges, which has since closed and been converted into flats. As it is today (right) Many uses: There was a builder, undertaker and joiner stationed at\u00a0Broad Quay Bristol when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855 . How Broad Quay Bristol looks now. It has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat . Little difference: The view through St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works . High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 . St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now . Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was\u00a0destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940.\u00a0Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed . Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol.\u00a0The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s . Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again . Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone . Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol. It is believed the set of pictures could fetch up to \u00a330,000 when they go up for auction tomorrow . This photo shows Host Street in Bristol.

A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media,\u00a0Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but\u00a0has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say.

Sick: All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Vera Maresova (pictured covering her house outside court) thought their deaths would be attributed to natural causes . Location: Vera Maresova killed five women and one man over a four-year period at this hospital in Rumburk - a small town in the north of the Czech Republic . Prosecutor Frantisek Stibor said: 'She is not insane and knew exactly what she was doing. Therefore she is fit to stand trial. 'She used her knowledge of medicine to cause malfunctions in heart rhythms which led to heart failure and death.' The first murder was in January 2010 and was followed by another at the end of 2011. In April 2012 she killed her third victim and three more between February and June 2014.

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'",

The cardboard gnome was signed by all four members of the Beatles after starring on the iconic cover of the Fab Four's 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Cardboard cutouts or waxworks of more than 60 celebrities including Bob Dylan and Marlon Brando were on the cover picture, which was the brainchild of artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth and photographer Michael Cooper. The cardboard gnome was signed by all four members of the Beatles after starring on the iconic\u00a0cover of the Fab Four's 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band . The tiny cardboard gnome is next to the legs of George Harrison, who is wearing red on the album's cover art . The gnome is next to the legs of George Harrison, who is wearing red on the album art. Following the shoot on March 30, 1967, Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by the band, who each signed it. The model has emerged for sale almost 50 years later after being listed for auction by a private collector. Auctioneers in the US have valued the gnome, which has some water damage, at about \u00a317,000. Dean Harmeyer, of Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection.' The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was \u00a33,000 - a whopping \u00a350,000 in today's money. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles,' Mr. Harmeyer explained. The Gnome has been valued at \u00a31,700 and was singed by all four members of the band after the shoot . On the shoot: Assistants organise the set for the artwork which cost \u00a33,000 - the equivalent of \u00a350,000 today . 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot. 'The gnome is in two parts - both front and back were created by Blake for the shoot, and presumably joined together, which may explain the small holes at the top and bottom of each. 'The Beatles have all signed the back in the lower, lighter portion in green marker. 'There appears to have been a liquid spill to on the back after the signing, which has affected the Ringo and John signatures. 'Both the front and back elements measure approximately 20 inches high by 5 inches wide. Both gnome elements are framed with a vintage, unopened stereo copy of the LP.

Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green. History was assured. He wasn\u2019t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters. He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn\u2019t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130 . Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history . Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn\u2019t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn\u2019t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods\u2019s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole. If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall. Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth\u2019s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before \u2014 but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too. \u2018I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,\u2019 Spieth confirmed. \u2018I was going to have to work around Henrik\u2019s line \u2014 and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss. \u2018I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it\u2019s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to set a record is awesome.\u2019 Spieth broke Raymond Floyd's 36-hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes . At the age of 21 and playing in his second Masters, Spieth looks in complete control . Billy Horschel, Spieth\u2019s playing partner, had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day. Horschel deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message \u2018Nice hole, Jordan\u2019 as they stood on every tee. Nothing changed overnight. Many had Augusta pegged as the venue where Rory McIlroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015; instead, this Masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young Texan gunslinger, now in the vanguard of an American revival. Up ahead of Spieth, Ernie Els laboured valiantly to stay in touch. It was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career. At the age of 25, as McIlroy is now, Els won his first major, the 1994 US Open. He was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade, and he won it again in 1997. By that time, however, a 21-year-old called Tiger Woods had announced his arrival at the 1997 Masters. The era of Els never materialised. McIlroy may have achieved more and younger than Els, and Spieth may not be the ice-cold winning machine Woods was at his age \u2014 but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days. Already in the record books, Spieth has many more landmarks in sight these next two days. The record for birdies here stands at 25 from Phil Mickelson; Spieth already has 15. His course management was outstanding. Spieth took Augusta on, yet remained entirely in control. It helps that he is exceptional, yet strangely unspectacular. As Graeme McDowell pointed out recently there are better drivers, better chippers, better putters \u2014 and the statistics bear this out \u2014 but none who do all three as well as Spieth. He might not have the best game; but he has the most complete. There were tiny aberrations \u2014 he found the pine straw twice on the back nine \u2014 but they were rare. Most of the time, he was consistency personified, picking out the best line, the best lie, the most advantageous position on the green. When he dallied with a bunker on the par-five eighth, his third shot was so perfect that he sunk a two-foot putt for birdie. Spieth made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the Augusta fairways and greens . The young Texan pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round . \u2018That was special, even for you,\u2019 said Horschel\u2019s caddie Micah Fugitt. It was a masterful display, the work of a wise head not a callow college boy. It isn\u2019t just that Spieth doesn\u2019t think like a 21-year-old. At the 15th, a par five and a good birdie opportunity, he sensibly laid up, and then made four. Even when he missed, he missed cute. He has absorbed a lot from his mentor Ben Crenshaw, a fellow Texan and Augusta expert. Asked about \u2018Ben\u2019s advice\u2019 on Thursday, Spieth sweetly replied: \u2018Do you mean Mr Crenshaw?\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a hint of irony in his response. Had he stayed in school, he would be studying for his finals right now. Instead he is fast approaching \u00a310m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major. The next Tiger? That is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders. The idea that McIlroy is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked. When Spieth shot 63 to win the Australian Open at Royal Sydney, the conditions were windy and inhospitable. McIlroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made Spieth\u2019s score. Geoff Ogilvy claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in Australia. Where do Spieth\u2019s first 36 holes stand in the annals at Augusta? Ray Floyd played the previous best 36 holes \u2014 13 under par \u2014 in 1976. Spieth now has that record, as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18-hole lead. Like McIlroy\u2019s US Open victory at Congressional in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books. He has barely put a foot wrong. Nice hole, Jordan? Seriously, dude, name one that wasn\u2019t. Spieth recovers from among the trees at 13, and his caddie Michael Greller has to hand it to him (below)",

Mr Odell's original tweet read: 'Cheers @Aldi, just used your shop in Mk for the first time....and last.' It has already been re-tweeted more than 1,600 times. Irate: Andrew Odell tweeted Aldi a series of messages after discovering the mouse inside the packaging of his loaf of bread. It is believed he had been to the store in Milton Keynes but said it was the last time he would . Aldi said it had contacted Mr Odell and was investigating the grim discovery 'as a matter of urgency' The company responded today by saying it was looking into the incident. A spokesman for Aldi said: 'Please be assured that the safety of our shoppers is Aldi\u2019s number one priority. 'We have contacted the customer and will look into this as a matter of urgency.'",

Another hurdle on their way to the Premier League has been negotiated as they secured a hard-fought win over Reading. This was tense, though. Manager Eddie Howe would testify to that. But winning a place in the top-flight has never been easy; Bournemouth are finding exactly that out. Callum Wilson celebrates after opening the scoring for Bournemouth in the fourth minute . Wilson opens the scoring for Bournemouth early on against Reading at the Madejski Stadium .

BOURNEMOUTH: Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie, Arter, Surman, Pugh (Smith 69), Kermorgant (Pitman 75), Wilson (Jones 90) Subs not used: Camp, Gosling, Fraser, Ward . Goal:\u00a0Wilson 4 . Booked:\u00a0Boruc, Francis, Wilson, Smith . Referee:\u00a0Keith Stroud . Attendance: 18,917 . But, as of yet, the Cherries aren't choking, Callum Wilson's 22nd goal of the season setting them on their way to a third successive win at the Madejski Stadium. Howe said: \u2018It was nervy, with what\u2019s at stake it was always going to be that way. We defended for our lives and showed incredible mental strength. It was a different kind of win than we\u2019re used to, but results are the most important things now. \u2018I\u2019d much rather we were playing total football and doing what we\u2019ve done all season, but we are finding a new way to win and I\u2019ll take that at this stage.\u2019 There was no doubt over which team needed the three points more. This victory secured Bournemouth's position in the top-six, meaning - at the very least - that they'll have a crack at promotion via the play-offs. Reading, under Steve Clarke, have all but secured their Championship status, and with an FA Cup semi-final date at Wembley against Arsenal on the horizon the Royals, perhaps, had other matters on their mind. And so it proved as the Cherries took a fourth minute lead when Wilson fired home from close range after Andrew Surman's shot from the edge of the area struck Adam Federici's far post. It was exactly the start Howe wanted as they looked to maintain their position at the Championship summit. But the visitors had goalkeeper Artur Boruc to thank in the 17th minute as he produced an outstanding one-handed save to deny Jamie Mackie's close range effort from Jordan Obita's cross. And Nathaniel Chalobah, Hal Robson-Kanu and Obita all waste good opportunities to level for the Royals as they mustered a promising response to going behind. These were worrying moments for Howe, who paced regularly from the dugout to his technical area to holler instructions at his players. And despite Yann Kermogrant sending a towering header from Marc Pugh's cross narrowly wide during the dying seconds of the first-half, Bournemouth's early mojo had vanished. Bournemouth's Simon Francis (left) on the run with Nathaniel Cahalobah in hot pursuit . Players appeal to referee Keith Stroud (right) as Wilson lies injured on the ground . Howe would have been happy to get his players in at half-time; his side, in truth, were starting to rock. That's what pressure does to a team. In fairness to the Cherries, though, not once did they part with the passing principles that have put them on the brink of automatic promotion. And the south-coast club looked to have regained their composure during the opening exchanges of the second half. Though, goalscorer Wilson was booked for diving in the 55th minute as the striker took the necessity for points too far. Yet, despite his side's improvement, Howe looked far from comfortable in his technical area. And Bournemouth were struggling to create the opportunities that would have calmed their manager's obvious nerves. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe (centre) and his players applaud the travelling support . There were nervy moments for the travelling Bournemouth fans as the end of the match approached . One mistake, one moment of magic from a Reading player and this match would have been back in the balance. Not only the match, but his side's chances of automatic promotion. Matt Richie went within inches of providing Howe and his team the cushion that they desperately craved in the 63rd minute. The Royals defence made a mockery of trying to clear a Bournemouth throw deep inside their half, the ball eventually fell to Richie who let fly with a curling left-footed effort that skimmed the top of Federici's far post. Steve Cook then saw his half-volley from the edge of the area held by Federici as the visitors started to turn the screw. Wilson (bottom) is challenged by Reading's Alex Pearce during the Championship clash . Reading manager Steve Clarke gestures to his players but the hosts could not find a way back . But Reading refused to lie down, and had Danny Williams not miskicked in the final six minutes then the hosts could easily have pulled level. Wilson missed a glorious chance to seal victory for Bournemouth in the 87th minute, but his control let him down at the vital moment. And the visitors had endure some terrifying moments as Reading laid siege to the Cherries goal. But Howe's side held on for another vital victory as their promotion bandwagon rolls on... just.",

The 250-piece\u00a0Lilly Pulitzer for Target\u00a0collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel\u00a0that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home d\u00e9cor\u00a0from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the\u00a0#LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell\u00a0them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn\u2019t get there with this launch and for that, we\u2019re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That\u2019s frustrating, both for them and for us. We\u2019re taking a close look at what happened. We\u2019re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we\u2019re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we\u2019ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it\u2019s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we\u2019d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans\u00a0criticized\u00a0Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are\u00a0hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .",

Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg . A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday . A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday . At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA.\u00a0Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow . 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' an RSPCA spokesperson told Fairfax media . There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said . The taskforce was established to investigate the use of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets to train competitive greyhounds. It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

Following one stunning round with another happens about as often at Augusta National as pieces of litter drifting across the property. Here, the youngest first-round leader in Masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36-hole record total of 14 under par, beating the old mark of 13 under set by Ray Floyd way back in 1976. It also tied the lowest 36-hole total seen in a major, set by three others, including Sir Nick Faldo at The Open. Jordan Spieth chips on the 17th hole during the second round of the Masters on Friday . Spieth watches his tee shot from the 16th in front of a packed crowd at Augusta . The 21-year-old walks past the scoreboard on the 18th hole following his sensational performance . Dustin Johnson eyes up a putt no the 18th green during his record-breaking display on Friday . Johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course\u2019s scoreable par fives to devastating effect. He had eagles at the second and the 8th, birdied the 13th, before striking a wondrous blow to the 15th that pulled up 12 inches from the flag. The difference between him and Spieth is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67. Johnson will start the third round seven behind his fellow American with game chorus line member Charley Hoffman two strokes nearer the lead following a creditable 68. Gutsy Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey are on the same mark as Johnson, with the former weighing in with a fine recovery of his own. Rose was three over par after four holes but rallied strongly after drawing a line on his scorecard, like you\u2019d draw a line in the sand. He played the last 14 holes in a plucky five under for a 70, while Casey underlined he is a man reborn with a terrific bogey-free 68. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68, one shot ahead of Ernie Els (72), while Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69, his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors, and his first here since 2011. He is still no fewer than 12 shots behind, mind. What of the world No 1, Rory McIlroy? Alas, if it\u2019s Friday it must be time for one of those freaky nine holes that just kill him at the Masters every time. Ernie Els hits a shot off the fourth tee during his second day of action . Last year it was on the back nine and this time the outward half, as he followed a bogey at the 7th with a double at the 9th to turn in 40 strokes. It\u2019s the sixth year in a row the Northern Irishman has thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he addresses the problem, he simply cannot win a green jacket. At least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he has made mentally from the days when his shoulders used to slump. One shot outside the projected halfway cut mark, he birdied the 10th and then, at the 13th, the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past, he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap-in eagle three. McIlroy missed from 3ft at the 14th for a par but, in a rousing finish, birdied the 15th, 17th and the 18th. To the accompaniment of loud rumbles of thunder in the distance, McIlroy came home in just 31 shots to stand alongside Woods on two under. Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69; his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors . Woods's girlfriend\u00a0Lindsey Vonn watches on from the crowd during the second day of action . Texas golfers have a long and proud history of coming up with prodigious feats that stun the sporting world. Byron Nelson once won 11 events in a row on the PGA Tour in 1945. Ben Hogan won three major championships in succession in 1953 and probably would have won the fourth as well but for the fact The Open clashed that year with the USPGA. Now here comes Spieth, who to this point has turned this Masters into his very own \u2018hello, world\u2019 moment with an awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we haven\u2019t seen since another 21-year-old named Tiger walked away with the 1997 edition. All this on the day another Lone Star legend, Ben Crenshaw, waved goodbye to the Masters. It\u2019s tempting to talk about a passing of the Texas torch, except Spieth is destined for a level of greatness twice Masters champion Crenshaw could only dream about. Think Hogan rather than Gentle Ben. Rory McIlroy reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what was a frustrating day for the World No 1 . Paul Casey tries to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole . As for Tiger, his first round 73 was actually an awful lot better than his score and the reviews suggested. It was, in fact, the most encouraging signs we\u2019ve seen for him for well over a year. His short game was back to its best and his task on Friday was to instil some rhythm in his long game. That is exactly what happened. The rare sight of him finding the first fairway was encouraging and even better was the laser iron that followed. It finished 10ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole. For 15 minutes, it was like watching Tiger at his best. The rest of the round was also heartening. He reached the turn in 34 to be one under for the event and inside the top 20. Justin Rose flips his club into the air after the English golfer cleared a sand trap on the 13th green . Ben Crenshaw closed out his Masters career with two mediocre rounds at Augusta . A birdie at the 11th and he was on the fringes of the top ten. How he does over the final two rounds is one more fascinating question during a weekend featuring many. Els was trying to build on the small miracle of his opening 67. The South African finished eighth on his Augusta National debut in 1994. Two months later, at the age of 25, he claimed the United States Open. Everyone looked at his languid grace off the tee and gossamer touch around the greens and wondered how many green jackets he would win. Twenty years on, he\u2019s still waiting for his first. But he\u2019s still in there trying. Depending on your viewpoint, his 72 leaves him perfectly placed to take advantage if Spieth feels the pressure over the weekend; or well in the mix to notch his third runner-up finish at the Masters. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68 just one shot ahead of Els .",

Sterling is stalling on a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer, although he insists it has nothing to do with money and he will reassess his options at the end of the season. The 20-year-old, who has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs, was one of four players at the Anfield launch of next season's New Balance kit in front of over 1,000 fans, with one shouting from the crowd 'Make sure we see you in it next season'. Liverpool's attacking midfielder Raheem Sterling is stalling on a new big-money contract at the Anfield club . Sterling (centre right) poses with Martin Skrtel (left), Simon Mignolet (centre left) and Daniel Sturridge (right) The four Liverpool players huddle together on stage at the launch of their new home kit for next season . Sturridge uploaded this to his Instagram account as he posed with Sterling, Mignolet and Skrtel at the launch . Sturridge posed with his team-mates and uploaded these snaps to his Instagram account . That made the youngster slightly more uncomfortable than he already was perched on a stool on stage, and speaking afterwards Sturridge said having regular football - which he is virtually guaranteed at Liverpool but possibly not elsewhere - was a key consideration for Sterling. 'I don't know what Raheem wants to do but it is just important to be able to play regularly,' he told Press Association Sport. 'As long as he is playing regularly he will be happy - I don't think it is anything to with anything other than that and I hope he will stay at the club. 'It is important, regardless of who you are, to show what you can do - not just for Raheem but any young player. 'It is important to play games and gain experience so whatever decision he makes I am behind him 100 per cent.' Sturridge experienced something similar himself when he left Manchester City for Chelsea aged 19 but things did not pan out how he would have liked at Stamford Bridge and he left for Liverpool in January 2012 after 63 appearances in four years. As he matured he has enjoyed greater success at Anfield, scoring 40 goals in 67 appearances but his good form was interrupted this season by a five-month absence with a thigh problem. Since returning in January he has scored four times in 15 games and some of his performances have drawn criticism simply because he has not matched the heights of last season when, playing alongside Luis Suarez, he scored 24 times. Daniel Sturridge is bidding to return to his best form following a lengthy spell out through injury . However, the England striker knew he would not rediscover his best form immediately, which he believes will only come with a full pre-season under his belt. 'It has taken time to get back into the groove. I have missed a lengthy time and gaining sharpness while playing games is not easy in a league like the Premier League - you can't ease yourself back in because the games are very fast,' he added. 'It has been a difficult season in terms of the injuries but I know I will come back strong and get back to exactly how I was performing before. 'It is going to take time, it is not going to happen overnight, I understand that. 'It is the sharpness and fitness side of things. It takes a long time and that is the whole point of having a long pre-season. 'I am looking forward to helping the team this season and towards next season I will be right back to where I was, because I would have had a pre-season I will be back to the sharpness and fitness levels I had before.' Sturridge has been criticised by some supporters for failing to hit the same heights he did last season .",

Some are dressed in jeans and shoes - they have no kit or boots. Stories of strife are swapped. 'I'm only here so I can get a shower,' \u00a0says one as he rolls a cigarette. 'The wife booted me out a week ago and I've been on a settee since.' Jesper Blomqvist helped coach youngsters from Manchester United Foundation's Street Red project . Another is reflecting on how this kickabout, for those who may have suffered from mental health issues, is the latest tentative step on a long journey back from the brink. 'I was on a bridge over a motorway,' he says as he looks into the distance. 'They sectioned me for five years.' Into this environment walks a man who knows all about adversity. Jesper Blomqvist, he of hand in sleeve and knee often in cast, is back in Manchester. The Swede, now 41, was a key cog in Sir Alex Ferguson's treble-winning machine, making 38 appearances in that memorable season following a \u00a34.4m switch from Parma. The midfielder (left) was a crucial player in Manchester United's treble winning season of 1998-99 . But his 67 minutes in the late, late Champions League Final win over Bayern Munich in Barcelona would be his last in a red shirt. Three operations and two gruelling years of rehab later he was on his way to Everton but would continue to be haunted by injury before eventual retirement. He is here on Sunday to coach youngsters from the Manchester United Foundation's Street Reds project, but given his background he may also be well suited to having a word with those vacating the pitch. Blomqvist now helps his brother lecture people on how to handle setbacks using his previous experiences . The years have been kind. Blomqvist's long hair remains and is now accompanied by a beard which makes him look suited to the role he currently performs. 'I lecture with my brother,' he explains. 'He's a psychologist so he talks about how to handle setbacks and how to keep on performing. I can relate to that and give some real life examples from my career both good times and bad times. We speak to people from companies who have team building days.' Blomqvist celebrates their semi-final win over Juventus with Steve McClaren (centre) and Dwight Yorke . Blomqvist had the world at his tricky feet when he signed for United in 1998. He was one of few players Sir Alex Ferguson had to try more than once to convince to move to the club, after he spurned the Scotsman's advances to sign for Parma and Carlo Ancelotti after a frustrating year on AC Milan's bench. 'I liked Italy,' he explains, apologetically. 'It was nothing to do with Manchester. I had learned the language and I had settled in. I enjoyed the life and I enjoyed Parma, but then Carlo Ancelotti left.' Blomqvist revealed that he rejected Sir Alex Ferguson the first time and signed for Parma in 1997 . Sir Alex Ferguson came back again and managed to sign up his man to compete with Ryan Giggs . Back came a determined Ferguson and this time he was successful, bringing Blomqvist to the club to compete with Ryan Giggs on the left. It went well. In that treble-winning year Blomqvist picked up three medals, although one was almost consigned to Catalonian turf in the celebrations that followed United's belief-defying victory over Bayern at the Nou Camp. 'I don't remember much about that night,' he reveals. 'It was high tension. Afterwards it was joy. I lost my medal on the pitch jumping around and I had to start looking for it. I was scared but I found it in the end.' The Swede (bottom left) started for United in the Champions League final victory against Bayern Munich . The Red Devils were involved in one of the most exciting comebacks of all time after winning the trophy . United have a quite sensational season, winning the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League . Then came injury. Blomqvist went under the knife three times and it was here where he learned the lessons he now passes on. 'You try to get your head down,' he says. 'Small goals. In a few weeks I can go on the bike, then a few more and I can go running. But it's hours and hours of rehab and you feel like an outcast. You lose the connection with everyone, especially if it goes on for a long time.' Eventually Ferguson called him into his office for the inevitable chat. Blomqvist in action for United during the 1999 Champions League final where they completed the treble . 'I remember that last discussion because I felt quite guilty,' he says. 'I had been injured for so long and they kept paying the wages. He said 'don't worry, this is football - you gave me one excellent year and we won everything'. 'When he said that it was as though a stone fell off my heart. It meant a lot to me that he could feel like that. 'Of course he phoned Water Smith and helped me to get a deal with Everton - it spoke volumes of him.' Blomqvist enjoyed his time at Goodison Park where he was restricted to 17 appearances. The 41-year-old had an injury hit time at Everton and only managed 17 appearances for the club . 'Without wanting to be disrespectful it was a smaller club,' he says. 'There were fewer people working there which made it feel more like a family and I enjoyed that.' During Blomqvist's nine months on Merseyside, Smith was replaced by David Moyes. 'I enjoyed playing for him,' he says. 'He was, is, a good coach. That's why I was surprised it didn't work (at United). It was always going to be really hard to take over from Sir Alex. Sometimes it's about getting the right job at the right moment. 'Maybe it was bad timing. The only thing I think he may have done wrong was to change too many of the staff. When you have such a winning concept its very dangerous to change too much. Of course he wanted to put his mark on the club so you can understand it but I think it backfired.' Blomqvist worked under Ferguson and David Moyes (right) and spoke highly of them both . After Everton, Blomqvist endured a short stint with Charlton Athletic ('I enjoyed London but I was injured all the time') before heading back to his homeland. He will, however, be back in the red shirt of Manchester United in when the club's legends team recreate that 1999 final against Bayern's veterans at Old Trafford on June 14. 'It's always competitive with Manchester United,' he says (Blomqvist set up Andy Cole for the equaliser in the 3-3 first leg at a packed Allianz Arena). 'I play with lots of the old teams I have been involved with but there's a difference with United. 'Nobody wants to lose. They are fit and ready.' Now, at last, so is he. All money raised from the legends match will go towards Manchester United Foundation\u2019s work in the local community.

Boasting front and rear lights, rear view mirrors and even a car horn, the team behind the electric Babel Bike say it is unprecedented in its approach to safety. And perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them. Scroll down for video . London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike. Called the Babel Bike it has a host of features including a roll cage. Crispin Sinclair (shown with the bike) is seeking \u00a350,000 of funding on site Indiegogo. The bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor . The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop. Crispin will be hoping a similar fate does not befall his invention though - and hopes the array of safety features will appeal to safety-conscious cyclists. He is seeking \u00a350,000 ($74,000) of funding on Indiegogo to bring his dream to fruition. The price might be a bit much for some, with the non-electric version retailing for \u00a32,499 ($3,693), and the full electric version \u00a33,499 ($5,170). Both are \u00a3500 ($740) less if bought through Indiegogo. May 2016 is the estimated delivery date for the bike at the moment. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike\u2019s innards. It doesn\u2019t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. \u2018In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can\u2019t assist at higher speeds (by law),\u2019 the team notes on their Indiegogo page.

There is a holder for a smartphone on the front so you can keep track of vital stats . The controls for the Shimano 250-watt electric assist motor are located on the handlebars, and provide up to 50 per cent assistance. The battery has a range of 50 to 80 miles (80 to 130km). The bike is recharged by either removing the battery and recharging it at home, or with an optional electric-car-charging lead. At the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors, which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock.

But Crispin notes in a video that even all these safety features \u2018won\u2019t help in a collision with a turning bus or truck at a junction - by far the single biggest cause of cycling fatalities.\u2019 Transport for London says that 65 per cent of all bike fatalities in London are caused by trucks and buses cutting across cyclists. So the team designed a roll cage for the bike, which prevents it getting trapped under a vehicle. If a truck or bus comes into contact with the bike, it will hit the roll cage first and ensure the cyclist is pushed to relative safety \u2013 or at least, that\u2019s the plan. The side of the seat \u2013 also detachable \u2013 has foam pads to cushion against side impacts, while the shape has apparently being designed with aerodynamics in mind by former Red Bull F1 engineers. \u2018Our dream is to put a million more cyclists on our roads, and therefore take a million cars off them, and to do that we need to give cyclists their safety back,\u2019 said Crispin. Whether the bike will prove to be more of a success than his father\u2019s invention remains to be seen, though.",

Even though they took the lead with a well-worked goal by Philippe Coutinho (right) in the 30th minute, Liverpool never gave the impression they would give Steven Gerrard a dream date in the final on his 35th birthday and their lame performance left Rodgers shattered. He said: \u2018We\u2019ve come up short in a few games, that\u2019s something we\u2019d certainly need to improve. But I think all these experiences will make them better. \u2018We\u2019re a team that\u2019s grown and changed quite a bit in the summer. \u2018We\u2019re obviously bitterly disappointed, more with the performance.

The world No 1 - now 103 places above Woods in the world rankings - is the favourite to win the Masters next week and claim his first green jacket, thus completing a career Grand Slam. Woods, who has confirmed he is ready to play at Augusta after spell working on his game, is one of only five players to win the Masters, The Open, the US PGA Championship and the US Open - and it's that success which led to a young McIlroy aiming to emulate him. Scroll down for video . A young Rory McIlroy is portrayed by an actor in the film as it charts his progress in the sport . McIlroy played golf from a young age and always admired Woods as he grew up in Northern Ireland . McIlroy grew up watching Woods and is now on his way to emulating his hero . McIlroy revealed recently that he sent Tiger a letter saying he was 'coming to get' him . Rory's rise from child prodigy to the world's best - along with his fascination with Woods' stellar career - has now been beautifully told in a new two-minute video created by their sponsors Nike. Entitled 'Ripple', the clip features a number of young actors portraying McIlroy as a kid and into his teenage years - from hitting plastic balls around his parents' living room, to practising relentlessly in his hometown of Holywood, Northern Ireland. A common theme runs through the video as McIlroy and his father keep a close eye on Tiger's progress on both the PGA Tour and at the major championships. Speaking about 'Ripple', McIlroy said: 'As a kid, I looked up to Tiger. When I first saw him on TV, I remember being completely enamored by the energy he brought to the sport. His will to win. His determination. His fight.' McIlroy and Woods will line up at Augusta for the Masters this week but in contrasting form . Woods with McIlroy at the tee of the 12th hole final round of the Memorial Tournament in 2013 . 'I've been in that same situation,' said Woods. 'Growing up, Jack (Nicklaus) was my idol. My first recollection of the Masters was 1986, when Jack won. 'I remember him making a putt at 17 and lifting that putter up. Fourteen years later at the 2000 PGA Championship, I got to play with and against him \u2013 someone I looked up to.' It remains to be seen whether Woods will be at the business end of the Masters come Sunday but McIlroy relishes playing with his idol. 'It's been an incredible journey for me, going from massive fan to competitor,' he added. 'To think that not too long ago I was that little boy watching him on TV to where I am now. 'It's been a cool journey and I'm very lucky I get to compete with and against him, because he inspired me as a kid and he inspires me now. He's the best player I've ever seen.'",

Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with his Thai girlfriend moments before his death. He is also understood to have clashed with a man who was seen talking to his girlfriend at a bar. The incidents happened in Hua Hin, a coastal town and beach resort 120 miles south-west of Bangkok. Tragic: Iain Mackay, 40, (pictured) is understood to have got into a fight at the Hua Hin resort, 125 miles south of Bangkok, after discovering the woman chatting with another man at a bar in the coastal city . Thai police said Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a shop near to the bar where he had spotted his girlfriend. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed. However, friends of Mr Mackay claim that he had clashed with another man who had been talking to his girlfriend moments before his death, the Press and Journal newspaper reported. Others said that Mr Mackay had posted links to his girlfriend\u2019s Facebook page before his death in which she was pictured with another man. One friend said: \u2018Iain was obviously upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.\u2019 Those close to Mr Mackay said he had been in a relationship with his girlfriend for several years. Mr Mackay, an underwater research specialist, is believed to have been employed by seismic research company Polarcus, which is based in Dubai. Location: The resort where Mr Mackay died is in Hua Hin (pictured) - a coastal city 125 miles south of Bangkok . Sources at the company confirmed that Mr Mackay was on leave from his vessel and had told colleagues that he planned to spend his time off in Thailand. Thai officials said that Mr Mackay had died at 3pm on Saturday but relatives claim that they were told of his death on Friday. The Foreign Office also confirmed that Mr Mackay had died on Friday. A spokesman said: \u2018We can confirm the death of a British national in Hua Hin, Thailand, on April 3. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.\u2019 Mr Mackay\u2019s death comes nine years after a British former public schoolboy was murdered after splitting with his Thai wife at the Hua Hin resort. Toby Charnaud, 41, was beaten to death with an iron bar and wooden staves by relatives of his ex-wife, Pannada Laoruang, in August 2006.

His feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others. And observers were quick to point out that Abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in Australia. Abbott was in a Sydney pub on Saturday evening when a group of Australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them. The Prime Minister accepted and even gave a short, impromptu speech, one of the football coaches, Simon Carrodus, told The Australian Woman's Weekly. \"Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head. And he was proud as punch,\" Carrodus said. A schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint. Video of Abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants \"Skol! Skol!\" drew plenty of attention on social media. Some commentators focused on Abbott's drinking technique. But others suggested he was setting a bad example. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. \"Like most Australians, I enjoy a drink on social occasions,\" he said in January 2014. \"However, as a father and as a citizen, I'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent, especially at \"hot spots\" in our big cities.\" Casting those concerns aside, some social media users belittled Abbott's beer swilling. They said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds.",

Steve Tempest-Mitchell, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, lost a whopping 16st after the surgery 14 months ago, which caused his stomach to shrink to the size of a tennis ball. The 56-year-old said he decided to go through with the operation after hitting 32st and struggling to control his Type 2 diabetes. Scroll down for video . Slim and trim: Steve Tempest-Mitchell says he has a new lease of life after slimming down from 32st to 16st . 'It was a case of going in for the surgery and hoping to come out the other side,' said the father-of-three. This was a life changing and life threatening decision for me to make. 'At 32st, it was not an easy decision as I had been turned down for the surgery two and a half years previously . 'It had got to a point where something had to be done because I was slowly killing myself. I was just waiting for something awful to happen and even needed psychiatric help.' Although he never indulged in binge-eating, Mr Tempest-Mitchell says he would eat smaller portions at regular intervals and was drinking around eight cans of cola a day. But the former bomb disposal expert hadn't always been big and he says that growing up, he lived an active lifestyle, regularly playing rugby and competing in wrestling. Flashback: Mr Tempest-Mitchell said he was almost a recluse when he was at his biggest (above) As he got older, he began to struggle with his weight thanks to a lifestyle of long-haul flights, business meetings and boozy evenings spent entertaining clients. Mr Tempest-Mitchell also had to contend with some highly stressful situations while working as a bomb disposal expert between 1996 and 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he was employed as a contractor with the Ministry of Defence. Using high-pressure water technology, he would set about the grim task of defusing bombs. 'It was a very stressful situation,' he explains. 'Not only have you got to handle the situation of defusing the threat of the bomb but you are in dangerous territory as well under guard from soldiers. Helping hand: The former bomb disposal expert said he needed to be pushed in a wheelchair to board a plane . 'We were very lucky as one of the bases we were stationed at was attacked by a rocket launcher just weeks after we left.' Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who is now a business development manager at a demolition and asbestos removal firm, said as the years went by, his weight crept up. 'I had a very active lifestyle before my work and life balance was disrupted and I began to not have time to eat right,' he said. 'I was never one of those people who would eat massive amounts of food where you are stunned by the amount but I did have small portions regularly. 'Ever since I was a child, I always drank coke. At one point, I was having between six to eight cans a day. I have had to completely cut coke out of my life as well as other fizzy drinks. I don't mind if I never have one again.' The father-of-three said his weight affected his self confidence and esteem . As a result of the weight gain, Mr Tempest-Mitchell almost became housebound at his heaviest and was forced to plan every trip out. His weight issues even affected his working life, as well as his confidence and self esteem. 'I was forced to park the car as close as possible to wherever I was going, if I couldn't, I'd have to turn back and go home,' he recalls. 'I was almost becoming a recluse as I was unable to visit sites for my work so instead worked from home. I was becoming a burden on my family, especially when we tried to go on holiday. I had to be taken to the plane by a buggy or wheelchair.' Fed up, he took the plunge and opted for surgery - a decision that coincided with him finding that he was about to become a grandfather. Both of his daughters, aged 26 and 36, were expecting babies. 'My one daughter came to see me while I was recovering from the operation and broke the news that she was pregnant,' said Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who also has a 34-year-old son. Although he never indulged in eating too many snacks, he said he would drink up to eight cans of coke a day . 'I was so thrilled as I knew the success of the surgery would allow me to be more active and enjoy spending time with them as they are growing up.' As well as losing more than a stone a month, he has also seen his waist shrink from 66 inches to 42 inches and his chest go down from 66 inches to 48 inches. 'Now I feel like I am a new man,' he said. 'I have the energy to play with my grandchildren, who are both nearly one, which I would not have been able to do before.'",

Meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside. But are any of these high-tech suncreams worth buying? Here, Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, offers his verdict. And we rate them... A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra-red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside. Here, consultant dermatologist Bav Shergill gives his verdict . Dr Skin's Suncare Lotion And Sun Drink . \u00a311.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion, dr-skins.com . CLAIMS: SPF 30 suncream containing UVA and UVB protection, plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin E, lycopene, vitamin C, beta-carotene and other nutrients for skin health. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables. 'There's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage. 'The suncream is ok, but it's pretty standard.' 5/10 . Ladival Sun Protection, SPF 30 . \u00a319.99 for 150ml spray, from Boots and supermarkets . CLAIMS: First mainstream product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB. Also has antioxidants. Offers 'protection against four times more of the sun's rays'. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'The effects of infra-red A rays on the skin is an emerging field of research. 'A recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra-red A. 'I'd plump for Factor 50 rather than Factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent. 'You can get the same UVA and UVB protection from cheaper products.' 6/10 . Dr Skin's lotion and sun drink comes with liquid food supplement shots, while Ladival is the first product to\u00a0protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB . Goldfaden MD Sun Visor Oil Free Spray, SPF 30 . \u00a340 for 80ml, Space NK stores . CLAIMS: This protects against UVA/UVB rays - it contains titanium oxide, oxtinoxate, benzophenone and organic red tea extract. Developed by a U.S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure.

EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation. 'Children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing. 'Avocado oil is a good moisturiser, but it's not clear how it 'aids the development of the cutaneous barrier'. 'I'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well.' 7/10 . Actinica Lotion . \u00a319.99 for 80g, larger branches of Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacies and pharmacy2u.co.uk . CLAIMS: For the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients (e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system, such as transplant patients). Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells. 'Patients who've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use.' 8/10 . Wilko Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50 . \u00a32 for 50ml, from Wilko stores . CLAIMS: A UVA and UVB sunscreen. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This does what it says on the label. 'It has the same UVA and UVB protection ingredients as other more expensive creams, plus it is water resistant, and easily absorbed.' 9/10 . Actinica aims to\u00a0prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients while Calypso contains UVA and UVB protection, is water resistant and won't stain clothes . Sun Ceutic 50 Anti-Ageing Sun Protection SPF 50 . \u00a331 for 50ml, from uniqueskin.com . CLAIMS: This is said to prevent photo ageing (sun-induced skin damage) and sun spots and contains a 'powerful stem cell stimulator'; also contains hyaluronic acid, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and aloe vera. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'All Factor 50 suncreams with UVA and UVB protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots. 'Hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin, but there's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream. 'It's not clear what the 'stem cell stimulator' is. 'This is the Holy Grail in skin care as it would reset the clock on skin cells, but I'm not aware that anybody has managed to do this yet.' 6/10 .

EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This is OK for a school situation as children are mainly indoors. 'Suncream needs to be reapplied about every two hours if you are out in the sun because the creams get rubbed off - so this is not quite the once-a-day panacea you might anticipate.' 7/10 .",

An 18-month-old baby and three girls - aged three, six and eight - were trapped on a sandbank at Blackpool Beach while out walking during the school break. But when it was obvious they had found themselves in trouble, those perched on the nearby pier did nothing to help - instead, they took out their smartphones to record the drama. Two mothers saved the lives of three girls and a baby after the youngsters were trapped by the rising tide .

Lifeboat crew member Nathan Lee told the paper: 'They thought they were going to die. One mum was disgusted people were filming it all on cameras, not helping. 'A few more minutes and none of them would be here.' The incident serves as just another reminder of the dangers of rising tides after more than 60 spectators had to be rescued at the Boat Race in London on Saturday. Lifeboats were deployed to transport the onlookers from the shore after they became trapped on the edge of the River Thames. Video footage showed a group of at least 40 people stranded by the rising waters after watching the rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge universities. A boy, reportedly eight years old, was also rescued from an embankment after he became separated from his mother, while seven people were evacuated from Chiswick Eyot when they were cut off by the rising tide. The RNLI said it was a 'surprise' to find so many spectators in trouble and the number was 'significantly greater' than in previous years. Many were unaware that they would be exposed to the substantial wash from the flotilla following the races and from the rising tide, it said. As a result many were cut off and found themselves with limited options to reach higher ground. Chiswick RNLI station manager Wayne Bellamy said: 'This incident showed once more that the tidal Thames can catch people unaware.'

CNN reported Tuesday, citing US officials briefed on the months-long investigation conducted by the FBI and Secret Service, that the hackers were able to access real-time, non-public schedule of President Obama, which is regarded as highly sensitive information that is sought after by foreign intelligence agencies. In October 2014, the White House acknowledged that there had been suspicious activity on its unclassified network serving the executive office, prompting system shutdowns and security upgrades. Vulnerable: A new report has revealed that Russian hackers launched a cyber-attack against White House's unclassified computer network last year . Privacy concerns: The hackers reportedly accessed President Obama's non-public schedule, which is considered highly sensitive information . Sneak attack:\u00a0According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network . A six-month investigation into the breach, described as one of the most sophisticated attacks against the US, reportedly uncovered evidence pointing to hackers working on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network. To accomplish this task, the cyber-bandits allegedly working for the Kremlin commandeered a State Department email account and sent a phishing email to someone at the White House designed to trick the recipient into downloading malicious software. Silver lining: White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said last year's cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information . Once downloaded onto a White House computer, the malware presumably allowed the hackers to penetrate the unclassified network containing Obama's schedule that is not accessible to the general public. According to an anonymous government official, the hackers have been able to re-enter the State Department computer system, despite efforts to keep them out. The Russian Embassy did not publicly comment on the hacking allegations . The White House responded to CNN\u2019s revelations by saying the report did not refer to a new incident but was \u2018speculating\u2019 about the source of cyber activities that were disclosed last year. Spokesman Mark Stroh said in a statement that the White House would not comment on CNN's attribution of the cyber-attack to Russian hackers. \u2018Any such activity is something we take very seriously. In this case, as we made clear at the time, we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity,\u2019 Stroh stated. \u2018As has been our position, we are not going to comment on the referenced article's attribution to specific actors.\u2019 White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said in an appearance on CNN Tuesday that the White House in 2014 disclosed cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information. \u2018We have an unclassified system and then we have a classified system, a top secret system,\u2019 Rhodes said. \u2018We do not believe that our classified systems were compromised.\u2019 But he said, \u2018There's always vulnerability.\u2019 For that reason, Rhodes said the White House operates a separate, secure system for classified data.

The vital findings have been suppressed for nearly four months, and have only emerged now after the Care Quality Commission quietly revised its report to rate many of the hospital's services as 'good'. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' and placed it in special measures, along with a dozen of the worst hospitals in the country. But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up by Labour Party activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation. The new version of the report rates the hospital as 'good' in 18 out of 33 criteria that were assessed including its outpatients departments and overall standard of end-of-life care. It also praises a number of the hospital's departments and individuals as 'outstanding' including its maternity ward, intensive care unit, specialist children's nurse in A&E and the chaplain. Crucially, the report \u2013 a draft of which has been leaked to the Mail \u2013 shows that the CQC ignored a second, far more positive spot check of the hospital when it published its initial report. In January \u2013 a week before the first report came out \u2013 inspectors returned to check up on two wards where they had raised concerns about standards of care during a visit in September. They found major improvements and praised nurses for treating patients with dignity and respect, responding promptly to call bells and ensuring patients were not in pain. Yet the watchdog ignored these findings when placing the hospital in special measures. Hinchingbrooke \u2013 which serves 160,000 patients in Huntingdon \u2013 was controlled by the private firm Circle from February 2012 until last month. NHS patients were treated there as usual but Circle \u2013 rather than NHS managers \u2013 was in charge of the day-to-day running of the hospital and its budget. The firm was praised for driving down waiting times, lowering the death rate, reducing infections and improving overall care. After January's report Circle announced it would be withdrawing from its contract. The hospital is now being run by the NHS Trust Development Authority. The rating of 'requires improvement' in the revised report moves the hospital from the bottom 13 per cent of hospital trusts in the country to an average score, which is achieved by 59 per cent of organisations. Today the watchdog will upgrade the 'inadequate' finding to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report . The Mail has repeatedly highlighted concerns by MPs and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation. One of the inspectors was a member of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. Another was a senior figure in the British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, who had previously spoken out about the dangers of private firms' involvement in the NHS. Neither took part in the spot checks a week before January's report. Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman said: 'This is an extraordinary procedure and raises serious questions about how the CQC goes about its inspections. 'It's an admission by the watchdog that its first inspection report was over the top and far too tough. It's all been heavily influenced by the public service unions. I will be writing to the Health Secretary to demand a full investigation into whether this was a stitch-up.' A spokesman for Circle said: 'This vindicates our view that the inspection of Hinchingbrooke was flawed. The evidence has always been that Hinchingbrooke was a good hospital, with low mortality rates, low waiting times, and positive reviews from other NHS regulators.'",

Bethany Farrell, 23, from Essex, died on February 17 while in Queensland's Whitsundays, a week into her dream gap-year when she went scuba diving for the first time. Two people who were on the boat when Ms Farrell died have taken to TripAdvisor to slam Wings Diving Adventures for the way they handled the tragic circumstances. While one of the reviews criticises the way people on the boat were treated amid the panic, a friend makes the shocking claim that photos of the backpacker shortly before she died were deleted. The backpacker's father is devastated that picture evidence, which may have been able to explain some of the mystery behind the drowning, was discarded before police could see it. British backpacker Bethany Farrell, 23, died on February 17 while scuba diving in Queensland's Whitsundays . 'There is no excuse,' Bethany's father Patrick Farrell, 47, told the Courier Mail. 'Grave mistakes have been made. Ultimately her life was in their hands. Now she\u2019s dead.' Ms Farrell drowned on her first ever scuba dive\u00a0after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year. She was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. A post mortem determined the cause of death was drowning. Last week a number of reviews from distressed fellow travellers - who were on the charter when Ms Farrell died - emerged, slamming the tour guides' handling of the situation and claiming photographs were deliberately deleted. 'What was supposed to be a dream trip turned into the worst possible nightmare,' one user wrote. The same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of Ms Farrell with others before the dive, but when they contacted Wings Diving Adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted. Scathing reviews have been posted to TripAdvisor slamming the\u00a0Wings Diving Adventures charter boat operators and claiming they deleted photographs of Ms Farrell . The young woman was just one week into gap year in Australia when she tragically drowned . Ms Farrell was on her first scuba diving trip when she tragically drowned near Blue Pearl Bay (pictured) 'We got in contact with wings solely because they had pictures their staff had taken of the three of us before the dive. Wings deleted these pictures to make way for pictures of their next trip.... despite the likelihood of the police wanting those pictures as evidence,' the review also read. 'Wings have made no effort in contacting our friend's family to express their condolences, we feel they are an absolute disgrace.' Another diver also on the same boat made similar claims, saying the people on the boat were left without any information for a number of hours after the incident which claimed Ms Farrell's life. 'The girl who had the accident was found dead, and what's worst is that I now know that they deleted all of the pictures that had been taken on the boat before they could give it to the girl's family or police,' another review claimed. 'This is destruction of evidence, and I want to make sure that Wings does not get away with this,' the traveller continued. This report was written by a distressed woman who was on the boat when Ms Farrell drowned. Wings refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia . Ms Farrell (not pictured)\u00a0was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay in the Whitsundays . When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Wings Diving Adventures declined to comment on the incident, or whether any photographs had been deleted. Queensland police said they could not comment on specific elements of the investigation. Ms Farrell's father said he was not going on a 'witch hunt' but was desperate to get the truth about his daughter's death and the photographs. 'I don\u2019t want to go on a witch hunt. But this will go to an inquest. We\u2019re heartbroken and will do anything to get to the truth,' he told the Courier Mail. The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death. Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell\u2019s mother Caron, said at the time: \u2018The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends. \u2018At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help. \u2018They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.\u2019 The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell\u2019s death are fully understood. Ms Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there. She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17. The case is still being investigated by Queensland Police, who will hand a report over to the coroner.",

Ballance's 122 was the mainstay of England's 333 for seven declared leaving West Indies needing an unlikely 438 to win the first Test. They finished the fourth day on 98 for two after another superb Chris Jordan slip catch made the breakthrough. Gary Ballance scored 122 as England took firm control of the first Test against the West Indies in Antigua . Ballance plays a sweep shot during his impressive innings at the\u00a0Sir Vivian Richards Stadium . Ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in Antigua . Ballance, who had a poor World Cup , said: 'It's been a tough winter but four bad innings don't make you a bad cricketer. I would like to think I was settled at number three after last summer. Scoring a hundred in a Test match is a great feeling. You have to enjoy doing well,' as his joyous century celebration indicated. Even with the ever-present Pietersen factor Ballance added: 'That's international sport, I haven't doubted my place. I knew I had done well before. I didn't come here thinking that I was going to get dropped. I was focused on scoring runs and to get a hundred is huge.' There needs to be an opening for KP to make a sensational England comeback. But there looks to be no room in the line-up for Pietersen. Ballance at number three followed by Ian Bell and Joe Root seems a rock solid middle order for the Ashes this summer, by when KP will be 35. Joe Root formed a solid partnership with Ballance and made big inroads against the home side . Root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day . Jordan's stunning one-handed catch off part-time bowler Joe Root to dismiss Darren Bravo was a critical moment . Ballance said: 'It was brilliant by CJ but he does it all the time. He's got unbelievable hands.' Ballance summed it up as\u00a0a 'very good day, pretty much perfect' adding: 'It would have been nice to get one or two more wickets but we're happy with that, to get two this evening puts a lot of pressure on them.' West Indies coach Phil Simmons said: 'We're still looking to win the game. The first hour is vital for both sides. We wanted to be around 100 for one at the close.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nSKYFARING . by Mark Vanhoenacker . (Chatto & Windus \u00a316.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker\u2019s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our \u2018historic relationship with aviation\u2019. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights \u2014 exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia\u2019s great blue heron as \u2018the 747 of the swamp\u2019 and notes how this would delight the aircraft\u2019s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more \u2018a place\u2019 than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the \u2018frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better \u2014 everything looks better \u2014 when your feet are warm\u2019. He writes elegantly about his pilot\u2019s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth\u2019s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And \u2018meet\u2019 really means \u2018meet\u2019: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, \u2018our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.\u2019 Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there\u2019s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as \u2018Klingons\u2019. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as \u2018the heavy\u2019, one acting as \u2018heavy out\u2019, the other as \u2018heavy home\u2019. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker\u2019s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region\u2019s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city\u2019s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker\u2019s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics\u2019 singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls.",

Philippe Coutinho eventually broke the deadlock after 161 goalless minutes across the two games but Blackburn came close to levelling matters when goalkeeper Simon Eastwood was denied in stoppage time. Sportsmail's Oliver Todd rated the player's performances at Ewood Park. BLACKBURN ROVERS: (4-4-2) Eastwood 7 . Could do nothing to stop Philippe Coutinho's winner but did well to deny Brazilian in the first half and even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time. Simon\u00a0even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time after performing well in goal . Henley 7 . Solid at right back, he kept Raheem Sterling quieter than most full backs in the Barclays Premier League would. Restricted in going forward as he kept an eye on England star. Baptiste 8 . So often found in the way of Liverpool's shots, even though he was suffering with a hamstring injury. Performed heroics at the back but couldn't quite hold out before being substituted. Kilgallon 8 . Another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge he faced from Daniel Sturridge and mainly restricted the England striker to potshots from range. Matt Kilgallon was another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge of Daniel Sturridge . Olsson 7 . Could have gone down when under pressure inside the Liverpool area but his honesty was his own enemy. Solid at the back. Conway 6.5 . Industrious down the right but often restricted as he looked to double up on dangerous Sterling. Corry Evans is no stranger to a challenge, and he put himself about in midfield, replacing Jay Spearing . Evans 6.5 . No stranger to a challenge, put himself about in midfield after replacing cup-tied Jay Spearing. Booked for desperate challenge on Sterling. Williamson 7 . Tracked back really well and did his best to neutralise the threat of Coutinho. Could have given away a penalty in stoppage time for challenge on Joe Allen but referee made right decision. Marshall 7 . Creative force. Provided the ammo for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they looked to take advantage of an unfamiliar back-line. Unlucky to be denied by Simon Mignolet. Ben Marshall was unlucky to be denied when his header was saved by Simon Mignolet in the second half . Cairney 6.5 . Anonymous at times but then tested Mignolet from range as Rovers grew into the game early in the second half. Rhodes 6.5 . Subdued upfront and looked a poor replacement for Gestede who had impressed at Anfield. Missed with key header in the first half. Subs . Gestede 6.5 (for\u00a0Conway 64) Came on to energise Blackburn as Liverpool took control but aside from one chance he showed a lack of match fitness, struggling with a hamstring problem. Spurr (for Baptiste\u00a079) No time to make an impact but kept things together well. Rudy Gestede came on to energise Blackburn but aside from one chance he showed a lack of match fitness . LIVERPOOL: (4-2-3-1) Mignolet 7.5 . Recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Save from Marshall on to the post in key moment. Simon Mignolet recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Saved from Marshall in key moment . Johnson 6 . Played on the right of a back four. Natural role for him and found chances to go forward but left gaps at times. Sakho 5.5 . Struggled from the start, looking uncomfortable on the ball and he picked up a hamstring problem. Substituted after losing out to Rhodes. Lovren 6.5 . Good return to the side, albeit against lower league opposition. Team selection on Saturday indicated he was fifth choice but Anfield career not necessarily over. Moreno 6 . Comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do. Alberto Moreno had a comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do . Lucas 6 . Provided a solid base in midfield and moved the ball around well but not much penetration as Liverpool toiled in first half. Allen 5.5 . Similar to Lucas, couldn't provide impetus where it was needed, though. May have handled in own area and later appeared to go down easily for late penalty shout. Coutinho 8 . The star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley. Clever move to find way to break Blackburn down. Philippe Coutinho was the star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley . Henderson 6.5 . His one-two with Coutinho set up the winner but his deliveries from dead-balls left much to be required at times. Sterling 6.5 . One of Liverpool's main threats as usual, playing down the left at Ewood Park. Impact blunted as Blackburn doubled up. Booked. Sturridge 5 . He's not back at his best yet and it showed. Seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times and was restricted to shots from distance. Daniel Sturridge is not back at his best yet and it showed. He seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times . Subs . Toure 7.5 (for Sakho 26) Solid in defence with Lovren, he ably deputised when Liverpool had to reshuffle early on and dealt with Gestede and Rhodes. Lambert (for Sturridge 85) No time. Headed first touch wide. REFEREE: . Kevin Friend 7 . Did all that could be expected of him. Missed Allen handball shout after Ben Marshall's header but that would have been harsh. Ignored penalty shout from same player in stoppage time. MAN OF THE MATCH: . Philippe Coutinho . A mercurial performance topped off with an excellent goal to decide the game. He knows how to make the difference in big moments for his club and Liverpool benefited from that again. Coutinho's shot finds the corner to decide the game at Ewood Park after a lack of clear-cut chances .",

The actress, who underwent a double mastectomy in 2013, was referring to a genetic test that currently costs more than $3,000 (\u00a32,000). Now a Silicon Valley-based start-up is offering an at-home DNA saliva test that detects the same gene mutations but is priced at only $249 (\u00a3167). A Silicon Valley-based start-up is offering an at-home DNA saliva test to detect the same gene mutations priced at just $249 (\u00a3167).\u00a0It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 . It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, along with 17 other markers, all of which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Women with a mutation in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of up to 80 percent for developing breast cancer and up to a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer. The company behind the test, Color Genomics, was founded by Elad Gil, a former cancer researcher at MIT and Otman Laraki, a former engineer at Twitter and Google. 'We founded Color because we want to give every person the opportunity to understand their genetic risk of cancer,' said Dr Gil. Angelina Jolie recently said that the cost of testing for breast cancer genes 'remains an obstacle for many women'. The actress, who is pictured here with her husband Brad Pitt, was referring to a genetic test that currently costs more than $3,000 (\u00a32,000) 'This important information gives people the opportunity to work with their physician to manage their risk and make key life choice.' To get hold of the test, a physician will need to order it online, with the patient receiving a kit at home. The kit has instructions on how to take a sample of saliva and send it back to a central lab for processing. 'We want to make sure that there is always a physician involved,' the founders told Quartz. Color Genomics is currently available in 45 states and is hoping to comply with regulations required in New York, Maryland, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Florida. However, the test has received mixed responses with some saying it might not be useful, and could even be harmful. 'I worry it will give women information that we really don't know what it means - and that women will make very difficult choices that turn out to be incorrect,' Frances Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition told NPR. 'If we have more women who believe they are at increased risk,' Visco says, 'we will have more women removing healthy body parts. 'We really do not have enough information to base this kind of expansion of this kind of testing.' Color Genomics did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com for comment. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen . Just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease, a study has found. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer. Most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow, and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells. This means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. As part of the study, Swedish and British researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients, in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago. They found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen, and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day, had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all.",

At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety. Win on Saturday and they will be out of the relegation zone. For Nigel Pearson and his men, their season starts now. When you\u2019re facing relegation you are supposed to be dispirited and lacking in confidence. So how on earth have Leicester won three on the bounce? Only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can better that as a winning streak. Leicester players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the Premier League . It has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for. Leicester were bottom on Christmas Day but win at Burnley and they will give themselves a real chance of staying up \u2014 something only two sides have managed after being bottom at Christmas. It\u2019s not just Leicester, though. The other promoted clubs \u2014 QPR and Burnley \u2014 have shown fantastic spirit. I have been in relegation battles and seen teams with less fight in them than these three. QPR earned a fantastic win at West Brom, were unlucky to draw at Aston Villa and battled manfully against Chelsea. Burnley might be on a poor run but you know Sean Dyche\u2019s side will battle until the bitter end. So how does a manager create a positive attitude when things look so bad? What you can\u2019t afford to do is let players sit and study the fixtures and start looking at how many points they need. If they are too busy working out the permutations, they\u2019re not concentrating on their game. Leicester face a crunch clash with fellow relegation battlers Burnley on Saturday . If a player is not being pushed it\u2019s easy for them to shift responsibility and hope somebody else gets them over the line. The best thing to do is keep them busy. If you\u2019re working hard on the training ground looking at team shape, developing players and preparing for games, you are making much better use of your time. I\u2019ve been in that situation as a player and the worst thing you can do is to wrap them in cotton wool. There is a tendency to try to protect people in case things go wrong. Training eases up because of injury fears and managers try to keep their players fresh. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has managed to create a positive attitude in his squad . But that leaves you sitting around with your thoughts and that can be dangerous. There needs to be mental stimulation \u2014 you can\u2019t sit around and wallow in self-pity. At this stage of the season a week can be a long time between games. Pearson and his players will be absolutely buzzing in training and it\u2019s important to take that energy and intensity into games. It annoys me when managers say it\u2019s all about results. The only way to win is to make sure that your performance is right and that comes from hard work during the week. Pearson has worked hard to make sure Leicester\u2019s destiny is in their own hands. Their form has struck fear into other teams. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring in the 2-0 victory against Swansea . The three promoted sides look brave enough to go out and play, but Sunderland and Hull look paralysed by fear. Steve Bruce thinks Hull\u2019s home form will keep them up but a look at the fixtures shows it won\u2019t be that easy. Leicester, QPR and Burnley have all given their home fans reason to cheer with their efforts and the thrill of the chase means everything is applauded. Contrast that with the toxic feeling at the Stadium of Light. Leicester have taken a long time to wake up but they have rekindled the atmosphere they had when they beat Manchester United. And with four of their last six games at home, they need to keep that up. If they can, and the level of their performance continues to harness the positivity of that home crowd, don\u2019t bet against them making the great escape. Fans still believe that Leicester can still avoid the drop from the Premier League .",

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled\u00a01,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits,\u00a0indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there\u2019s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia\u00a0there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you\u2019re allergic to dust mites you basically can\u2019t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings\u2019 or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body\u2019s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They\u2019re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a\u00a0humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It\u2019s because your dog\u2019s hair has allergens on it \u2013 left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too \u2013 forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.",

Nico Rosberg was brooding, his face stony, his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger. He was sitting next to Lewis Hamilton \u2014 as close as the German had got to his Mercedes team-mate all afternoon of the Chinese Grand Prix \u2014 at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations. Rosberg, whose usual coiffured, Euro-chic sheen had vanished, alleged that Hamilton had selfishly tried to spoil his race. The record states that Hamilton won, Rosberg was second and Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel third. But Rosberg feared he might be overtaken by Vettel before the second round of pit stops when Hamilton, then leading from pole position, slowed down a few fractions of a second \u2014 to conserve his tyres, he said.

Rosberg asked the team to get Hamilton to speed up, an instruction they issued and one with which the Briton complied. \u2018I wasn\u2019t controlling his race; I was controlling my own race,\u2019 said Hamilton, indignantly. \u2018I had no real threat from Nico.\u2019 But Rosberg said: \u2018It\u2019s interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace. That opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me.\u2019 Hamilton countered: \u2018My job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up.\u2019 Boys, boys. It took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public. We are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out. It was easy to sympathise with Rosberg but difficult to agree with him. Even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends, he must be reaching his wits\u2019 end, frustrated to distraction, wondering how on earth he can possibly beat Hamilton when he is on form. It seems, to this cod psychologist, that it was Rosberg\u2019s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race. \u2018We have first and second,\u2019 said the three-time world champion. Hamilton salutes the crowd as he makes his way on to the podium to collect his trophy for winning the Chinese Grand Prix . Daniel Ricciardo (left) and Daniil Kvyat battle for position on track - the latter was forced to retire after an engine failure . Hamilton is covered in champagne by Rosberg as the Mercedes pair celebrate a one-two finish . \u2018I don\u2019t care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel is only third. One thing is clear: Lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end. There\u2019s nothing more to say. True, Lewis will drive selfishly. These guys are egocentric b******s. It is the only way to win the championship, and Nico is the same if the s*** hits the fan. Lewis was better this weekend. \u2018There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that\u2019s it.\u2019 For Hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track, the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season, ending up in a gravel trap, his championship hopes devastated in 2007. He again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear Max Verstappen\u2019s crippled Toro Rosso. The safety car came out. Anti-climax though it was, a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for Hamilton. He was congratulated over the radio for having \u2018the full house\u2019: pole, fastest lap and race win. It was a flawless performance. The race posed many tantalising questions. The first was whether Ferrari could match Mercedes in the temperate Shanghai climate, as they managed in Malaysia a fortnight ago? They were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook Rosberg. They will keep Mercedes on their toes, and that is balm for the sport. Hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate Hamilton at the third consecutive race . Hamilton, who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year\u2019s title, made the perfect start. He inclined his car right on the grid, covering Rosberg next to him, before darting through the first, right-hand corner in front. Contest over before it started. An honourable mention for 17-year-old Verstappen, who drove his Toro Rosso with great elan. He put his car down the inside of Marcus Ericsson\u2019s Sauber, causing Max\u2019s father and former racer Jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage. He then applauded in admiration. Alas, Verstappen\u2019s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight. Red Bull\u2019s woes continued with Daniil Kvyat\u2019s Renault engine billowing grey smoke into the Shanghai air. Their other car, driven by Daniel Ricciardo, was ninth. McLaren were even less successful than Red Bull, again. Jenson Button was demoted a place to 14th, having collided with Pastor Maldonado\u2019s Lotus. Button\u2019s team-mate Fernando Alonso was 12th after being lapped by Vettel, his replacement at Ferrari. Vettel was smiling afterwards, but not as widely as Hamilton. Max Verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes, but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired . Jenson Button, who finished 13th, was involved in a collision with Pastor Maldonado towards the end of the race .",

These vintage posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience, passengers wore their best clothes and there was plenty of legroom. They\u2019re featured in a new coffee table book, Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975, which revisits a time when the skies were dominated by the likes of Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) and Continental. Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda\u2019s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in\u00a0Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist . British Overseas Airways Corp led to the creation of British Airways (left) while Continental merged with United Airlines' parent company . It was a time when it cost an incredible amount of money to purchase a ticket for a commercial flight, with many of the ads promoting transatlantic or transpacific travel. The adverts created for the biggest airlines of the day, including many which no longer exist, offer a glimpse at how air travel, advertising and society changed over the 30-year period covered in the book. From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart . The book hails the designers' creative genius and uses special techniques to replicate their work as accurately as possible . In addition to drawings the adverts include photos of natural beauty spots, including Sydney Harbour (left) and Bermuda's beaches (right) Mr Huhne\u2019s book hails their creative genius and uses 17 colours, five types of varnishes and two methods of foil printing and embossing to replicate their work as accurately as possible. Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 was published by Berlin-based Callisto Publishers, which offered this synopsis of the tome: \u2018It provides unique insight into the design and advertising methods of an era when airlines were considered the most glamorous business sector and quality was the main criterion for selecting a flight.\u2019 It retails from approximately \u00a3270 online in the UK and from $250 online in the US.",

Annegret Raunigk, 65, was plunged into a vortex of travel and trials thanks to the wish of daughter Leila, who turns ten this year, but says she is not bothered about what people say about her decision to have more children so late in life. Their scheduled births for the schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin,\u00a0is just weeks away - but there are major fears that the health risks for her unborn quads will spike massively if they are induced early. Babies on the way: Annegret Raunigk, 65, and her nine-year-old daughter Leila are seen during a recent ultrasound filmed for an upcoming documentary about how the teacher is preparing to welcome the quads . Annegret, meanwhile, is weathering the debate centred on the rights or wrongs of her decision to both become pregnant and raise the children with cool detachment. 'There will obviously be cliches bandied about,' she said, 'and I find that quite strenuous. But I have always been a person who says live and let live and it is not for the opinion of others but for me. 'I have enough experience of childbirth not to be afraid. I am not scared actually, I am just hoping to stay healthy and fit. If others are mega-prim about this I believe they have no interesting lives themselves and therefore it no longer bothers me. I think this is the right choice.' 'She is a very strong, very fit woman,' Her doctor, Kai Hertwig tells MailOnline. 'I hope she can come to full term, I think she can. She is very well placed to be a fit mother for these babies. The schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin, is set to become the world's oldest woman to give birth to quads . Ms Raunigk and her large brood are seen during an appearance on German television in 2005 . 'The pregnancy so far makes no distinction between the body of a younger or older person but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high burden. 'We of course are keeping a close watch on the cardiovascular system. We all have little or no experience with such a pregnant woman in this age group, but I can say that this is certainly going very well.' Thrombosis, her heart, her circulatory system - these are the areas causing concern for the unborns in the run-up to delivery day. 'But she is highly motivated and this positive psychological mood is optimally important, the rest is not in our hands,' added her gynaecologist. Both were speaking in a clip released by the RTL TV network which is airing her story on Monday night. One woman who had a child at 42 tells the programme: 'I met her and found her to be a very sympathetic and intelligent woman. 'As a 56-year-old woman who raised a just-pubescent son, it is hard to imagine why she would want to have quads. I also wonder how she can meet the needs of her growing children, especially as the children will have no father.' It was mentioned in the publicity clip released by RTL that her fertility treatment - including both donated eggs and donated sperm - would never have been greenlighted in Germany. Two countries where treatment for women of such an advanced age is allowed were stated as Ukraine and America. All her 13 children, ranging from Leila to a daughter of 44, were sired by five different fathers.",

But there is another form of the deadly gas, dubbed abiotic methane, that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor. Now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor . The reservoirs are secure, and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change. Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane, that can later be used as fuel. One reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge, in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'This ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the Arctic environment is ideal for this type of methane production,' said Joel Johnson associate professor at the University of New Hampshire. The Center for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Climate and Environment (Cage) estimates that up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of hydrates in the ocean floor. Scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\u00a0One such reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge (pictured), in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'But this estimate is not accounting for abiotic methane. So there is probably much more,' said Cage director J\u00fcrgen Mienert. Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. However, methane is also the principle component in natural gas.\u00a0It is a lucrative fuel source, which could contain more energy than all the world's oil, coal and gas put together. They believe the gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. 'Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor,' said Johnson. 'These only form in slow to ultraslow spreading seafloor crust. The optimal temperature range for serpentinisation of ocean crust is 200 \u2013 350 degrees Celsius.' Methane produced by serpentinisation can escape through cracks and faults, and end up at the ocean floor, causing a concern for future global warming. But in the Knipovich Ridge it is trapped as gas hydrate in the sediments. 'In other known settings the abiotic methane escapes into the ocean, where it potentially influences ocean chemistry,' says Johnson. 'But if the pressure is high enough, and the subsea floor temperature is cold enough, the gas gets trapped in a hydrate structure below the sea floor.' B\u00fcnz says that there are many places in the Arctic Ocean with a similar tectonic setting as the Knipovich ridge. Rather than causing a concern, the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long-term storage of methane carbon in deep-marine sediments. But other types of methane in the Arctic are causing a concern for scientists. Last year Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He tweeted: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane \u2013 which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Samples of the gas hydrates will provide more knowledge on abiotic methane. But they need to be drilled, as they are 140 metres under the ocean floor .",

Thanks to workplace discrimination, he claims, he has been forced to go it alone and is now planning to set up his own business. Mr Whelan, who officially changed his name to King of Inkland King Body Art The Extreme Ink-ite but goes by Body Art for short, has covered every inch of his body in elaborate inkings. Discrimination: Mr Body Art says prejudice against people with body modifications has affected his career . 'I've got my face covered in tattoos, I've got various animals and I've got a giant snake on top of my head,' he explains. 'My eyeballs are stained, it's also known as an eyeball tattoo. I've got pirates on me, aliens on me and I've got a blue penis. My penis is blue.' He also had his nipples cut off six months ago in a bid to provide himself with a smoother canvas and keeps the discarded body parts in his freezer 'next to my sprouts'. For all that though, Mr Body Art says employers should take him seriously and look beyond his personal appearance to what's inside. 'I personally find it really difficult to get my head around it because there are companies out there that employ people on merit,' he fumes. Legal: Mr Body Art shows off a passport emblazoned with his unusual self-chosen name . Official: Letters arrive addressed to\u00a0King of Inkland King Body Art The Extreme Ink-ite - Body Art for short . 'There are [body] modified friendly companies. But the majority are like: \"Look at these people! You look different from everyone in our office. You're different. You don't fit our criteria. We're not employing you.\" That's frustrating.' Now Mr Body Art is planning to solve the problem by striking out on his own and has begun making preparations for his new career by attending business seminars in his home city. His spare time is being spent helping the local branch of the Liberal Democrats campaign ahead of the election, although he admits that people often wish to talk about his body modifications rather than Lib Dem policies. 'Dealing with people shouldn't be a challenge,' he adds. 'Is that right? No, it's not. It's a blatant form of discrimination. Blank canvas: Mr Body Art shows off his nipples - they were removed to give him a smoother canvas . Covered: Mr Body Art's \u00a340,000 tattoo collection covers him, quite literally, from head to toe . Striking out: Mr Body Art, seen here at a business conference, plans to set up a company of his own . 'I'm not after sympathy of any kind. Most modified people aren't. I'd just like to be given a chance.' Mr Body Art, who appears on a Channel 5 documentary entitled 2,000 Tattoos, 40 Piercings and a Pickled Ear tonight, hasn't always had the acceptance he craves - even within his own family. His father Patrick has found his son's penchant for inking particularly hard to come to terms with and worries it might frustrate his plans for business success. 'I've never understood it and he knows I've never understood it,' he says. 'I can't come to terms with it. But I've accepted it. 'I'm not happy with it. I'd love him to be the son that I knew but he has chosen his own way of life.' Mr Whelan Sr says he finds his son's name change particularly hard to accept and wants to continue calling him Matthew as he always has. Mr Body Art, however, has different ideas. 'I legally changed [my name], I abandoned [the old one] and I've got a new name so call me by that,' he insists. 'We don't really talk about my tattoos but when it does crop up, it can get passionate,' adds Mr Body Art. 'But I believe in my tattoos. I am who I am.'",

One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette\u00a0reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher \u2013 you can\u2019t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.' It is not known at this time as to the nationality or the exact actions of the two passengers arrested . A spokesperson for Thomson Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by passengers on board flight TOM022 from London Gatwick Airport to Cancun, which diverted to Bermuda yesterday due to a customer incident on board. 'We operate a zero tolerance policy in relation to any disruptive behaviour. The passengers in question were removed from the aircraft and met by police. 'The flight departed within two hours to ensure the other customers could get away on their holiday as soon as possible. 'Customer safety is our priority at all times and we would like to reassure passengers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'",

Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with\u00a0a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series. FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21. On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment, there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years.",

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the deal Wednesday, saying the thermal-imaging company earned more than $7 million in profits from sales influenced by the gifts. The commission said two employees in FLIR's Dubai office gave luxury watches to five officials with the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Interior in 2009. The company also arranged travel for Saudi officials, including a 20-night trip with stops in Beirut, Casablanca, Dubai, New York and Paris. Investigation: FLIR Systems Inc. has agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle bribery charges filed by the SEC that involved expensive trips and gifts given to Middle Eastern government officials . 'FLIR's deficient financial controls failed to identify and stop the activities of employees who served as de facto travel agents for influential foreign officials to travel around the world on the company's dime,' said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit. The SEC said in a news release that FLIR reported the misconduct and cooperated with the investigation. Officials with the Wilsonville-based company echoed those remarks. 'The actions of the former employees involved do not reflect the values of FLIR or the high standards to which we hold ourselves accountable,' FLIR CEO Andy Teich said in a statement. The two former sales employees, Stephen Timms and Yasser Ramahi, agreed in November to settle SEC charges against them and pay financial penalties. The Securities and Exchange Commission (pictured) announced the deal Wednesday, saying the thermal-imaging company earned more than $7 million in profits from sales influenced by the gifts . FLIR got a multimillion-dollar contract to provide thermal binoculars to the Saudi government in November 2008.  Timms and Ramahi were responsible for the contract. They also negotiated sales of FLIR's security cameras to the same government officials. The SEC said Timms and Ramahi had Foreign Corrupt Practices Act training and were specifically told that luxury watches and vacations were prohibited gifts. The men falsified records in an attempt to conceal their behavior, the SEC found. Besides paying $9.5 million, FLIR must report to the SEC on its efforts to comply with the corrupt practices law for two years.",

But a survey of workers has also revealed working for government departments - long considered an easy ride - are among the jobs people would most like to have. The Department of Immigration ranked third in the survey, while the\u00a0Department of Defence and the Department of Health were also named in the top ten places Australians would like to work. Virgin, the second-largest airline in the country, was reportedly handed the accolade for its \u2018pleasant working atmosphere, a good work-life balance and strong management\u2019. Richard Branson's Virgin Airline is the place most Australians want to work for, according to a new survey . Desk jobs in government departments highly ranked in Australia\u2019s Most Attractive Employer awards . More than 50 per cent of participants in a study of 12,000 appeared to want to work for boss Richard Branson. Coming second in the survey of Australia\u2019s Most Attractive Employer is national public broadcaster the ABC \u2013 confirming a TV career is still high on the list of many people\u2019s dream jobs. And named in third place Thursday was the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, headed up by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Other Australians named the ABC as the place they would most like to work, alongside journalist Leigh Sales . Fourth and fifth place at the Randstad Awards were also airline and TV jobs, with the Seven Network and Qantas named respectively. People were asked which companies they had heard of, just how much they would like to work there and why they would like to work there. Frank Ribuot, CEO of Randstad Australia, said: \u2018The Virgin brand is widely recognised around the world and by people from all walks of life.

Our people get opportunities to be involved in our transformational projects and build their skills internally.\u2019 Qantas was beaten by Virgin Australia as the top place to work but it still came in fifth place in the survey . In sixth place was multinational food and beverage company Nestle who have headoffice in Rhodes in NSW . In seventh place, Aussies would like a job at Coles or Kmart owners Wesfarmers . In eleventh place was a career with the Australian Federal Police .",

They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system.

Trott, who looks sure to open with Alastair Cook in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday, fell for just two, top-edging an attempted pull against a St Kitts side bolstered by England bowlers Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood. It follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his England team-mate Jimmy Anderson but Trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in St Kitts ahead of the main business next week. Jonathan Trott failed twice with the bat during England's warm-up for the first Test in Basseterre . Trott is dismissed by his England team-mate James Anderson in St Kitts . Trott\u2019s only rival for the opener slot, Yorkshire\u2019s Adam Lyth, was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but Alastair Cook and Ian Bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match. England gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first Test as their low-key warm-up week meandered to a close. Their four days of cricket  have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action. Trott looks set to open the batting with Alastair Cook in Antigua in the first Test next week . England completed four days of low-key, uncompetitive warm-up action in Basseterre on Thursday . Alastair Cook . Jonathan Trott . Gary Ballance . Ian Bell . Joe Root . Ben Stokes . Jos Buttler . Chris Jordan . Stuart Broad . James Tredwell . Jimmy Anderson . The decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow Chris Jordan and James Tredwell to face some admittedly low-quality bowling, suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team. Barring a raging turner in Antigua next week there will be only one spinning place and Tredwell, already a likelier pick than Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit. His dismissal gave Rashid a chance of his own but Tredwell was given priority and can now start preparing for a second Test cap. Jordan, meanwhile, was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session, when England pressed for an extra half-hour's play following rain delays. That suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett, who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case. Captain Cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on Thursday . Ian Bell looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired . England will leave St Kitts and head to Antigua for the first Test against the West Indies on Monday . Those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill, with Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side, while Gary Ballance, Trott and Root featured for both teams at various points. Bell looked in best form, making a fluent 43 before retiring, while captain Cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session.",

Julie Robert, a cultural studies professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said it was 'problematic' that the Prime Minister, who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking, thought it acceptable to 'showcase his masculinity' by skolling a beer. \u2018It sets up a culture that drinking isn\u2019t about socialising with friends, it\u2019s about how quickly and how much you can drink,\u2019 she said. Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was cheered on by a crowd of about 50 as he skolled a schooner of beer . Mr Abbott came under fire after the incident as anti-drinking campaigners said he was glorifying binge drinking . \u2018It sets up a culture that drinking isn\u2019t about socialising with friends, it\u2019s about how quickly and how much you can drink.\u2019 On Saturday night Mr Abbott appeared happy to oblige  when he was asked to have a drink by University of Technology Sydney Bats coach Simon Carradous. It took the Prime Minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted 'skol' and 'Tony'. Dr Robert warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much, or how quickly, they can drink. 'It is the whole performance and the display and showing off which is the problematic part,' she told Daily Mail Australia. However, she said it was not just Mr Abbott's skol that was concerning, it was also the way media and other government officials have reacted to the event. In an interview on Sunday, opposition leader Bill Shorten quipped that he was 'just pleased that Tony Abbott\u2019s learning to drink beer without adding lemonade to it'. Mr Abbott was labelled 'un-Australian' for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign. Dr Robert said while drinking was a part of the Australian tradition, it was dangerous to make comments that would only  glorify irresponsible drinking practices and perpetuate the stereotype that drinking heavily makes you a true blue Aussie bloke. Critics said he should be setting an example that you don't have to drink heavily to be a 'true blue Aussie bloke' It appeared to take the Prime Minister about six seconds to down the schooner, as players cheered and chanted 'skol' and 'Tony' Health Minister Sussan Ley was quick to jump to Mr Abbott's defence saying there was 'nothing wrong' with the Prime Minister's antics. \u201cIf more people got up at 4.30 in the morning and went running and cycling and worked as hard as our Prime Minister to keep fit and demonstrate that there are many ways that you can do this, I think we\u2019d have a healthier country as a result,\u2019\u2019 Ms Ley said. During his night out, Mr Abbott gave a speech to the players, according to\u00a0Australian Women's Weekly. 'He grabs the microphone and gives a speech, which went along the lines of: 'well isn't this a real treat, I've been a rugby man all my life but now I finally get to hang out with some real footballers' to which of course the crowd went crazy,' coach Carradous said. 'Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt... He was proud as punch.' While Mr Abbott is not the first Australian Prime Minister to show off his skolling skills, with former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke a notable example, Dr Roberts said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking. 'I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s a partisan thing but I do think the climate has changed and we didn\u2019t [used to] have the concern over binge drinking that we do now,' she said. Mr Abbott was asked to have a drink by University of Technology Sydney Bats coach Simon Carradous, and the Prime Minister happily obliged . 'He drank the entire schooner, dribbling bits on his shirt... He was proud as punch,' a witness said .",

The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck \u2013 but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property \u2013 leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour\u2019s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over \u00a32million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a \u00a320million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for \u00a36.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for \u00a34.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents\u2019 in the hope of securing it for his family \u2013 his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: \u2018There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.\u2019 Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election. Eye for detail: The living room inside Campbell's \u00a36.75million Chelsea flat boasts lavish furnishings . Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a \u2018cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well\u2019. He told The Times: \u2018With a mansion tax, you\u2019re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I\u2019d leave. I\u2019d have to say, \u201cSorry, I want to ship out\u201d.\u2019 Campbell has also said: \u2018I\u2019m not earning what I was earning five years ago.\u2019 Experts have said that properties worth between \u00a35million and \u00a310million could incur an annual charge of up to \u00a325,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: \u2018Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.\u2019 Since 2009 Campbell has also owned Grade II-listed Hallington Hall, an 18th Century mansion in Northumberland. Fortune: Campbell accumulated a number of properties before and after his football career but has since said 'I don't earn what I used to' Campbell recently featured in a hard-hitting campaign to encourage ethnic minority Britons to vote .",

Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days after her initial report to police saying she was groped by Weinstein during a 'business meeting' at his office in Manhattan. It has been claimed the delay was because the Italian model and her manager were working behind the scenes to try and land her a film role. But once the 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to pursue the criminal case, sources told the New York Post. See below for video . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan last Friday night . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . After filing her police report on Friday, March 27, Battilana was eventually interviewed by Manhattan DA prosecutors on Wednesday, April 1, at the NYPD Special Victims Squad's office in East Harlem. Sources told the New York Post her former lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, withdrew from the case as he was concerned Battilana did not appear to be a 'serious victim'. The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and even tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat. But her new lawyer, David Godosky, refuted the claims, saying: 'She immediately went to the police, immediately cooperating with the Special Victims Squad.' Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse yesterday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Weinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall. The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night. She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported. Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'",

Kate, 33, is due to give birth to her second child in the coming days - providing a little brother or sister to Prince George. William's wife already has a nanny at her disposal as well as her mother Carole, who is moving into the Cambridges' Norfolk home Anmer Hall after the new baby arrives. Scroll down for video . Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George poses for photographers outside St. Mary's Hospital in London shortly after giving birth in 2013. She is currently preparing to give birth to her second child . So just how difficult is it to care for a newborn with a toddler running around? Very, as it turns out. Parenting blogger Emily-Jane Clark, who runs the popular site\u00a0How To Survive A Sleep Thief, which she describes as 'an antithesis to baby advice', has compiled a list of the ways that a mother can cope with caring for two kids under two. They including avoiding a double buggy, buying several blue bowls and never setting a specific time for meeting people. Read on to catch some of Emily's top tips... Having two children is significantly harder than having one, according to the experts (picture posed by models) 1. Do not bother trying to get anything done ever. While it is tricky to get stuff done with one baby, with two it is practically impossible. I have lost entire days trying to get things done and achieved nothing. You think, 'I know; I\u2019ll write a list, get organised, tick things off as I go along.' Easy, right? Wrong. Five days later you realise you haven\u2019t even managed to finish writing the bloody list. So I suggest doing what you can when you can. Better still just use this list: . Get up.\u00a0Look after the children. Anything achieved alongside this list is automatically a bonus. 2. Don\u2019t buy a double buggy. You will use it once, realise it is really heavy and annoying and sell it on Ebay. 3. Do not try to get anywhere on time. With two babies on the go, everything takes ages. \u2018Popping out\u2019 becomes a distant memory. I remember a time when nipping out for milk simply meant taking clothes out of the wardrobe, putting them on, grabbing my bag and leaving the house. Now it can take hours as I desperately attempt to scrub baby snot from my clothes with baby wipes, clean bums, clean teeth, change nappies, feed baby, break up fights, chase toddler, dress toddler, dress baby, leave house, forget bag, return to house, leave house, forget baby, return to house, get baby, leave house and then when I finally get to shop, I have forgotten what the hell I went for. As a mother of two young children, it is almost impossible to get anywhere on time (picture posed by models) 4. Someone always wants something from you. A banana, a biscuit, a drink, a dummy, a poo, a wee, a wipe, dinner, lunch, breakfast, a snack, toys, clothes. Take me outside, take me home, take me to the toilet, take me to the park? Story, piggyback, Play Doh, song. Your life becomes an endless cycle of getting stuff for small people. Some days you\u2019ll want to quit. Other days you\u2019ll want to scream. But you still get them the stuff. Because at the end of the day, it is far easier than being asked for the stuff, over and over again, ALL DAY LONG. 5. When you are expecting your second baby you will secretly worry whether you will love him or her as much as you love your first. Surely, it must be impossible to love another human being as much as you love your firstborn? There could never be a baby as cute, or as funny, or as beautiful. Then baby two arrives and they are just as cute, just as funny and just as beautiful. And before you know it, you can\u2019t imagine life without them. When children are young, they always want whatever toy the other is playing with (picture posed by models) 6. Get an extra pair of eyes to put in the back of your head because, at one point, your children will try to kill each other. Not intentionally, of course. But toddlers seem to be under the impression that \u2018dangerous\u2019 means fun. For example; 'It will be so funny to whack my sister over the head with a mug.' And 'I wonder what will happen if I stick this pencil right up my sister\u2019s nose.' 7. Buy two of everything. They always want what the other one has. Toddler could pick up a dead frog and Baby would still drop whatever she was doing and decide she desperately wants that dead frog more than anything in the world. You can tell them to share until you are blue in the face. But apparently \u2018share\u2019 is toddler speak for \u2018snatch\u2019. Prince William and Kate with their son Prince George, who will soon have a younger brother or sister . 8. I would also suggest that all the children\u2019s cups and bowls are the same colour. We have a single blue bowl that is currently making my life hell. 9. Having two children close in age can be exhausting and frustrating. It is rare that a day goes by where I haven\u2019t silently sworn about something. But mostly, it is pretty amazing. And there is a great comfort in knowing that no matter what, they will always have each other. When they are not trying to kill each other, they are best friends\u2026at least until they both want the blue bowl.",

Mandy Dunford, 54, was followed around her farm in the North Yorkshire Moors by 67-year-old Kenneth Ward, naked apart from socks and boots. The military historian even performed sex acts in front of her. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. Farmer Mandy Dunford, 54 (right), feels forced to leave her home after neighbour Kenneth Ward, 67 (left), who was jailed for exposing himself to her in 2011, was released from prison and allowed to return to his home . Police had discovered of a cache of weapons, including machine guns, in his home. A judge at Teesside Crown Court also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning the flasher from being within 200 metres of Miss Dunford. But while the former police officer believed her nine-year ordeal of harassment was over, Ward has now been released \u2013 and has successfully appealed to have the restraining order overturned. It means he will be able to return to his cottage next door to Miss Dunford\u2019s farm in Chop Gate, North Yorkshire. As a result, she said she feels forced to leave. \u2018I feel yet again that the offender has been given more rights than the victim,\u2019 the farmer said. \u2018My punishment for his crimes has been far worse than anything he has ever faced \u2013 I\u2019m losing my home so that he can return to his \u2026 I expected to live here for the rest of my life with my animals around me.\u2019 In a hearing held since Ward\u2019s sentencing, a new boundary was drawn up allowing him to approach Miss Dunford\u2019s farm from all sides. She added: \u2018It means he can follow me around with only the width of a wire fence between us. \u2018When I heard the order had been changed \u2026 I was horrified and I knew my only option was to pack up and leave. I will be forced to abandon my home and my life just so that he can return \u2026 I can\u2019t see the justice in that and I want to know why the rights of a man who tortured me for so long are more important than mine.\u2019 Miss Dunford\u2019s problems with Ward began when she put a gate across a lane shared by their properties. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. However, he has now been released and allowed to return home . She said: \u2018He first started exposing himself to me around 2002 and would peer in through my windows with his wild staring eyes. \u2018He\u2019d run around the house at night shouting and tapping on the windows \u2026 he\u2019d come right up to me and follow me around wearing nothing but boots and socks. \u2018Sometimes he\u2019d climb a ladder and expose himself over the wall of his cottage and once he confronted me on the lane and aimed a rifle at me. I turned and ran and heard five shots go off \u2026 I went to the police to report him but their response was hopeless.\u2019 Ward and his brother also left piles of maggot-infested animal carcasses outside her home. Police finally arrested him after Miss Dunford filmed the harassment and showed them hours of footage.",

Alongside the screengrab, Mings wrote: 'This is why I do it, this makes worth it [sic]' His apparent act of generosity drew over 2,000 'likes' and lots of praise from his followers, with many saying he was a role model that children should look up to.

Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly joined Michelle to surprise the crowd,and opened the broadcast with a gospel medley that included the song 'Alpha & Omega' and the hit single 'Say Yes' from Michelle's 'Journey To Freedom' CD. The group received a rousing standing ovation from the 9,000-plus crowd, but they weren't introduced as Destiny's child - they were introduced by their individual names. Scroll down for video . Nameless: Singers Michelle Williams, Kelly Rowland and Beyonce performing \"Say Yes\" during the 30th Annual Stellar Awards in Las Vegas last week. The singers did not refer to themselves as Destiny's Child . Touchdown: Destiny's Child perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show in 2013 . Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively that the threesome want to do another ten-year reunion tour and intend to cut a reunion album - but they won't use the group name for that either. And it's all by design. 'Alhough Destiny's Child is made up of the three ladies, Beyonc\u00e9's father and former manager Mathew Knowles owns one-fourth of the group as well. Anytime they do anything under the name Destiny's Child, he has involvement in it and money from it,' a source close to the group reveals to Daily Mail Online. None of the members of Destiny's Child want any involvement with Mathew, who once managed each of their individual careers as well as the group. Kelly was first to fire him in 2009, Michelle followed in 2010 and Beyonc\u00e9 finally nixed all dealings with her dad after accusations of stealing money from her in 2011. Mathew's marriage to Beyonc\u00e9's mother Tina Knowles ended after it surfaced he had gotten a woman named Alexsandra Wright pregnant. Once she gave birth to their son Nixon, Tina filed for divorce. In 2014, it was revealed that Mathew fathered a second child, a four-year-old daughter named Koi. 'That it was claimed Mathew stole money from Beyonc\u00e9 and then he sued to prove that he didn't was bad enough. But all of the extramarital affairs and children outside the marriage just made it so that Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't have anything to do with her dad at all,' the source explained. Before the split: Destiny's Child and Matthew Knowles pose for a portrait October 30, 2000 in Houston . In late 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary, 'Beyonc\u00e9: Life Is But a Dream.' But after \u00a0that, says the source, she stopped communicating with him again and his only access to her is via her assistant's work email address. The trio's unwillingness to deal with Mathew is why they keep putting off a Destiny's Child reunion album and tour. Their 2005 Destiny Fulfilled tour grossed approximately $70.8 million in the U.S. alone and according to Billboard it was the highest-grossing tour for either a pop or R&B band since TLC's FanMail Tour. Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly and Michelle wanted to record a 10-year follow-up CD and launch a tour. They know both the album and tour could a huge seller and break tour records. 'The problem is they can't figure out how to nix Mathew from the deal. They all want more than anything to give the fans one last run of the group, especially since they all have their own individual success, but don't want to deal with Mathew,' the source explained. It's unlikely that Mathew would allow the women to cut any deals without him. His financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month. Destiny's Child first album debuted in \u00a01998 . In late 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary. But after that, says the source, she stopped communicating . Last December photos emerged of a huge garage sale he was having in Houston, where selling both Beyonc\u00e9 and old Destiny's Child memorabilia to raise money. 'At best they maybe could offer him a flat rate or one-time settlement to buy out his portion of the group, but otherwise we may never get a Destiny's Child reunion because none of them want him to benefit financially,' the source concluded. Destiny's Child made their debut in 1998 with their self-titled release. The group then consisted of Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. In 1999, Mathew kicked out LaTavia and LeToya and replaced them with Michelle and a short-lived member Farrah Franklin (she barely lasted three months) before settling in as a trio. They would release four additional albums; win three Grammy Awards and go on to sell more than 60 million records worldwide. Mathew Knowles financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month .

Giant Beyonce posters sold \u00a0for $200 . T-shirts for sale: . After their breakup in 2005, Beyonc\u00e9 became an international pop star with five solo albums releases and 17 Grammy wins. In addition to starring in movies like Dreamgirls, Obsessed, The Pink Panther and Cadillac Records; Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband Jay-Z became friends of President Barack and Michelle Obama. Kelly first became a top-selling European music superstar before finding solo success in the U.S. with hit singles like 'When Love Takes Over' and 'Motivation.' With four solo albums under her belt, she's won a Grammy Award as a solo artist and became a judge for both Simon Cowell's The X Factor UK and The X Factor US editions. Michelle was has released three chart-topping Gospel CDs and dance album called 'Unexpected.' She's also starred in multiple Broadway productions including Aida, The Color Purple, Chicago, and Fela!.

Days later, the one-year-old bully breed mix showed up sickly and covered in dirt at a nearby farm. Now, the dog that defied death is recovering with the help of good Samaritans and veterinarians at Washington State University. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Ryann Simmons sits with the dog his girlfriend is fostering at their home in Moses Lake, Wash. The dog, Theia, survived being run over, beaten with a hammer and buried, and now needs surgery . Heroic: Theia, a 1-year-old bully breed mix was hit by a car and then struck in the head with a hammer and buried, but she managed to dig herself out . Hanging on: A driver hit the dog with a car -- and that person proceeded to strike the dog. The dog appeared to be hit with hammer in a mercy killing. The dog used to roam the streets getting scraps of food from people in Moses Lake, a farm town about 100 miles west of Spokane. About a month ago, she was struck by a car. Then things got worse: Someone cracked her in the head with a hammer and placed her in a box in a farm field. But the dog somehow survived and was discovered at a nearby farm with a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity. The wounds helped veterinarians piece together what happened, including the hammer blow. 'I'm assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery,' said Sara Mellado, who learned about the dog's plight on Facebook and took the animal into her Moses Lake home. She named the dog Theia. Recover: Theia is scheduled to go into surgery in a few weeks time after raising money through crowdfunding . New lease of life: Theia, who truly rose from the grave, rarely stops wagging her tail . Back on all fours! Theia's injuries include a dislocated jaw and multiple bone fractures around her nasal cavity, which makes it difficult for her to eat and breathe but it looks as though she is truly on the mend . 'Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,' Mellado told The Associated Press. 'She's a true miracle dog, and she deserves a good life.' Theia is receiving care at WSU's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Pullman. A CT scan of her skull revealed a condition that constricts the nasal passages, restricting air flow into the lungs, said veterinary resident Andrea Sundholm, who's assisting with Theia's treatment. It was caused by multiple nasal bone fractures. When Theia tries to draw air in through her nose, she's forced to open her mouth to breathe instead. But with a dislocated jaw, that is challenging as well. Theia's jaw is healing on its own, but the nasal-bone fractures have caused lasting problems, Sundholm said. Fixing that will require surgery to insert a stent, she said. Help out: Mellado has raised more than $12,000 towards the dog's surgery using the crowdfunding website GoFundMe. So far, contributions have come from Moses Lake, Washington State University and elsewhere . Ouch! X-rays of Theia's skull show the damage that was caused by everything she went through . The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund awarded $700 to help pay for Theia's early treatment. Mellado has raised another $10,000 for the surgery through a crowdfunding website, and is planning to call WSU to schedule the procedure. The university said despite her injuries, Theia is friendly and likes to kiss people's cheeks. Mellado said she has been deluged with calls from people seeking to help. Theia is staying with Mellado's family until they find her a permanent home. 'She's a puppy,' Mellado said. 'She's outgoing, lovable, up for meeting new people.'",

But many current systems fail to solve the problem of how energy is managed and used overnight when the sun sets. Traditionally, energy gathered during the day is sent back to the grid, but this can prove costly if you need to buy it back - unless you have a smart battery that stores the excess energy in your home. Sonnenspeicher (pictured) uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harnessed by solar panels. This energy can be used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity back to the grid, homeowners can then use their stored supply for power . With this in mind, German firm Automatic Storage Device (ASD) and designer Wolfram Walter have created the Sonnenspeicher. It uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store the energy harvested during the day by solar panels fitted to a roof. This energy is used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity to the grid, and potentially having to buy it back at a later date or time, homeowners can use this stored supply to power their home until the sun rises again.

For example, whenever there is energy in the battery available, the connection to the grid is locked. When this energy runs out, the Sonnenspeicher connects to the grid 'in a millisecond'. This switchover works the other way too. If a home is predominantly powered by the grid, the Sonnenspeicher will still store energy and instead act like a generator during a power cut. 'We wanted to create a storage system that makes you truly independent of the national power grid, that adequately supplies all of your household appliances at all times, and that remains efficient and trouble-free for at least 20 years, so that you can have the peace of mind that your investment really is worth every penny,' said the firm.

The firm said an average home can save around \u20ac1,200 a year (\u00a3876), so it would still take around seven years to recoup the costs, but the system will last for 20 years.",

Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 . 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video . The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 . Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National . Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding.\u00a0And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to \u00a310,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household. Waley-Cohen is a Celebrity Ambassador for The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) and was famously pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge at the Roller Disco he organised to raise money for a ward in memory of his brother.",

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com\u00a0said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .",

He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: \"Stop this Tim, don't do it\".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating.

He did so beaming from ear to ear, admitting that he had seen the tweets from his Manchester United team-mates congratulating him on scoring what he called \u2018one of the most important goals of my life\u2019. Not everyone had been as complimentary as Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney, with Sky pundit Thierry Henry criticizing him for not immediately running to Cristiano Ronaldo who played the ball to him for the goal. Javier Hernandez (left) scores to send Real Madrid into the Champions League semi-final . Hernandez struck in the 88th minute to send Madrid through and fierce rivals Atletico Madrid out . Marca (left) say Hernandez scored 'the goal of his life' while AS praises 'Chicharito' for winning the tie . To pick up on that and not on the out-pouring of elation is to not understand just how much the Mexican striker has toiled for the last two seasons desperate for a chance to do what he feels he does best \u2013 score big goals in big games. \u2018It was a great assist [from Ronaldo]\u2019 he said after the match once the adrenalin levels that sent him sprinting towards the Real Madrid supporters behind the stadium\u2019s south goal, had subsided. Despite starting only seven of the fifty games Real Madrid have played this season Hernandez has wriggled his way into the affections of the club\u2019s supporters much and on three occasions, he got himself into goalscoring positions on Wednesday night. With the first two opportunities he snatched at the chance \u2013 shooting woefully into the side netting in the first half with Ronaldo and Isco better placed, and pulling another shot across the face of the goal in the second period. But when he hit the target with the third opportunity the stadium responded. His name echoed around all four sides of the ground and that is not something afforded lightly to any player in their first campaign. There was nothing special about the finish but getting there, to apply it when for the previous 88 minutes he had run himself into the ground does deserve credit and he had around 80,000 spectators wanting to thank him personally at the end. Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) provided a splendid assist for Hernandez's goal in the Champions League . Hernandez celebrates Madrid's victory with team-mate Ronaldo after the final whistle . Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick led the tributes to Hernandez on Twitter after the game . The Spanish radio journalists who mobbed him as he emerged from some post-match physiotherapy, all wanted to ask him about the last great Mexican striker to wear the white shirt, Hugo Sanchez. With a goals-per-minutes ratio that is better than Karim Benzema\u2019s, there are even claims he should be starting more games. He replaced the Frenchman last night because of a knee injury that may yet sideline him for another couple of games. Once the euphoria of a last gasp winner subsides, Benzema\u2019s extra quality has to be recognized and \u2018El Chicharito\u2019s\u2019 place will eventually be back on the bench. In the longer-term he could satisfy himself in the knowledge that injuries will always present him with chances like last night. But he wants to be playing regularly and that will mean at the end of the season, when he returns to United, it will be to seek a new permanent deal elsewhere. \u2018He has suffered\u2019 said Carlo Ancelotti after the game. \u2018He deserved the goal because he has never given in. He always trains well and he always gives everything when he plays. It\u2019s a great reward for him.\u2019 Had the 88th minute strike not come and Atletico held on to win on penalties, Ancelotti would have been criticized for his faith in the Mexican and the \u2018Little Pea\u2019 might have played his last minutes for Madrid with only the league left to contest. Some believe Hernandez should start more often ahead of Karim Benzema, who currently has a knee injury . Hernandez missed a couple of chances before scoring, but his persistence eventually paid off for Madrid . Real's players celebrate after Hernandez's late goal secured progress to the Champions League semi-final . As it is Madrid still have nine games to play and he will play his part. He has already written himself a little piece of Madrid history and reminded everyone what he can do. No wonder he ran straight to supporters to wildly celebrate; no wonder he didn\u2019t want to leave the stadium last night.",

The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in.

The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",

'I was sorry for him, but also for the players who were on the bench or out of the squad. It is always difficult when you play a final and you have to choose the starting 11.' Pochettino has been impressed by Vorm's mentality, having left a regular starting place at Swansea to play back-up to Lloris. 'When I spoke with him about signing, he knew - I never lied to him. I told him our proposal and were very clear,' the Spurs boss said. Vorm (centre) played in all of the Capital One Cup games for Tottenham except the final . Pochettino (left) will again take on Burnley manager Sean Dyche at Turf Moor on Sunday . Tottenham head to Burnley in some positive form, having lost just once in the last four Barclays Premier League matches before the international break - and that at Manchester United. Pochettino, though, knows a solid collective defensive performance will be key against a side battling for their top-flight survival. 'We need to concede fewer chances and goals, but this is not about the keeper or the centre-back or the full-back or the holding midfielder - this is about the balance of the team,' he said.",

His wife Audrey spent part of last week in an induced coma owing to a serious infection. Leishman left Augusta taking with him the best wishes of his sport.

Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, was once dubbed \u2018Jabba the Hutt\u2019 by bullies and became so depressed over his size that he refused to leave his house for a year. He was just 18 when he took an overdose of 30 pills, but survived, ironically, because he hadn\u2019t taken enough to defeat his massive frame. Scroll down for video . From bulk to hulk: Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, pictured before (left) and after (right) his staggering weight loss, was once dubbed \u2018Jabba the Hutt\u2019 by bullies . Following his suicide attempt in September 2011, something snapped in Nathan and he made the decision to stop wallowing in self-pity and turn his life around. Within two years, he had shrunk to 14 stone. During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds. Nathan ran the streets in the dead of night when no-one was around and turned off the lights so he could use a treadmill at his local gym unseen. After a year, Nathan started using weights to tone his slimmed-down figure, and was so successful he landed himself a job as a personal trainer. Nathan, now a trim 13 stone, said: 'I was always overweight as a kid and as I grew up the bullying contributed to that because I tended to comfort eat. 'Others would throw sweets at me when I was on the bus and call me \"fatty\", \"fat mess\" and \"Jabba the Hutt\". Transformation: Nathan's former 26-stone bulk (left) drove him to a suicide attempt when he was only 18, but he has since lost more than half his bodyweight and is now a ripped gym instructor (right) Following his suicide attempt, something snapped in Nathan, pictured before his weight loss, and he made the decision to stop wallowing in self-pity and turn his life around . During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds . 'It was at that period in high school where I started to become really self-conscious about my weight. 'I didn\u2019t leave the house for a year and the only time I would leave my room would be to go downstairs to get food.' Nathan added: 'My parents were really worried about me and tried to tell me to go and see somebody for help. 'After the failed suicide I realised that I needed to turn my life around and I started to diet. 'It was scary going outside and I was too afraid to leave the house because I thought people would be judging me. Before his lifestyle overhaul, Nathan was a sugar addict who gorged on bacon and egg butties, chocolate bars and greasy takeaways. He then went cold turkey and cut out junk food, chocolate, crisps and alcohol, and said he was left suffering from flu-like symptoms as a result. Nathan snacked on cashew nuts and went on a strict low-carb diet which helped him lose a stone a month for eight months. In progress: Nathan said, 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence, so for the first month it was purely diet' He added,\u00a0'When I did eventually start going to the gym, I used to run in a darkened room which was there for people with low self-esteem' 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence so for the first month it was purely diet. 'Then I would get up at three or four in the morning to go for a jog because I didn\u2019t want anybody to see me. 'When I did eventually start going to the gym, I used to run in a darkened room which was there for people with low self-esteem.' By September 2013 - exactly two years after his suicide attempt - Nathan had dropped 14 stone, and has spent the last year dedicating his time to building the perfect body. Nathan now plans to enter body building competitions to showcase his transformation. Old ways: Before his lifestyle overhaul, Nathan was a sugar addict who gorged on bacon and egg butties, chocolate bars, alcohol and greasy takeaways, all of which he then quit cold turkey . 'I just want to show that it is possible to achieve what you want and it is never too late to get to where we want to be in life,' he said. 'I am so much happier now and my life at the moment has completely changed around from where it was three years ago.' He added: 'I am single but I do get attention from girls that I obviously wouldn't have got before. 'I want to show the people that bullied and harassed me that no matter how hard they beat me down, I will achieve more than them. 'If you\u2019re unhappy with yourself, nothing is impossible and you should follow your dreams to become the absolute best version of yourself.'

Hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber, putting children in danger of being radicalised, the country's most senior Muslim prosecutor has said. Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan:\u00a0'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said. Mr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation . The prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right) 'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.' Hundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain. His comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group. Waheed Ahmed, 21 \u2013 the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed \u2013 is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS. Ahmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by Turkish police at the border town of Reyhanli last week. He was one of a group of nine detained, all from Rochdale, including four children aged from one to 11. They could be flown back to the UK today. Nafir Afzal last month quit the CPS despite being cleared of allegations suggesting he texted a defendant in a case. In the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS. Mr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences. This included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions. He said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice. More recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall. He also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse. The prosecutor last year claimed that there would be a fresh wave of Operation Yewtree arrests concerning the abuse of children by celebrities. He said: 'This is a growing industry. There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some are very high-profile figures.' Mr Afzal began his CPS career in central London and went on to be awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.

The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey \u2013 including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family \u2013 including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children \u2013 are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 \u2013 who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago \u2013 served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul.

Waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in Hatay southern of Turkey last week . He is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group. Mr Danczuk said the number of Britons fleeing the country to join ISIS \u2013 now thought to number more than 600 \u2013 exposed the failure of the Government's anti-terror strategy. He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization. 'I do not think the Government's Prevent strategy is working and we need a much smarter approach from all the authorities to stop this cancer spreading.'

Oliveira has won 14 caps for his country and was once linked to a \u00a324million move to Manchester United, but his career has stalled at Benfica and Swansea is his third loan spell in as many seasons. The 23-year-old has found it tough to make an impression in south Wales but he is set to make his second Barclays Premier League start at bottom club Leicester on Saturday with Gomis sidelined by hamstring trouble. Nelson Oliveira is on-loan at Swansea from Portuguese giants Benfica but has struggled for first-team action . The striker (right) has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury and is expected to start against\u00a0Leicester . 'I've had to be patient waiting for my chance,' Oliveira told the official Swansea website. 'But that's understandable. It's normal that when you join a very good team who are doing well and are eighth in the table, then you have to wait for your chance.' Gomis has been ruled out for between three to four weeks after being injured in the early stages of last weekend's 1-1 home draw with Everton. The France international has scored four goals in seven games and Oliveira, who has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury in time to feature at the King Power Stadium, admits that Gomis' form has made life difficult for him. Oliveira is hoping to take his Swansea chance presented to him by the absence of the in-form Bafetimbi Gomis . 'Bafe has been doing very well and scoring goals,' said Oliveira, who has made seven of his eight Swansea appearances from the bench with his only start coming in the 5-0 home defeat to Chelsea in January. 'He's a good player and person and I feel for him because of the injury. 'He's been in a good moment and is important to the team. 'I'm not happy he is injured, but if it gives me a chance then I really want to take it; work hard, play well and help the team. 'It would be nice to score my first goal for the club and I'm always confident in my own ability. Manager Garry Monk is set to hand\u00a0Oliveira only the second Premier League start of his career at Swansea . 'And I know, the more I play the more confident I will get.' The injury to Gomis on the back of selling Wilfried Bony to Manchester City in January has highlighted the shortage of strikers at Swansea, and manager Garry Monk has made no secret of the fact that it is one department where the club need to strengthen this summer. 'It is an area where we need to help those who are here,' Monk said. 'We still need to look at Nelson and Marvin Emnes is not an out and out striker. 'Hopefully Nelson can have some more game time but we are looking to strengthen that area.'",

The research, carried out in Milan, backs up tests carried out by the charity Medical Detection Dogs. Its co-founder Dr Claire Guest said the charity's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer. She hailed the new study, describing the findings as 'spectacular'. Dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men's urine samples . The latest research, by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98.7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97.6 per cent . They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr Guest said: 'These results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. 'It is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a 'reluctance to embrace this tested, time-old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts. There is no single test for prostate cancer, but the most commonly used are blood tests, a physical examination or a biopsy.

Prostate cancer, pictured, is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year . 'Over the years, millions of pounds of NHS funding has been poured into the traditional test methods, and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability,' Dr Guest added. 'This has caused a huge waste of resources, not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals. 'Moreover, the detection dogs provide alternative solution that yields consistently accurate results. If our detection dogs were a machine, there would be huge demand for them.' Medical Detection Dogs, which is based in Milton Keynes, trains specialist canines to detect the odour of human disease. They also train Medical Alert Assistance dogs to help people with life-threatening health conditions go about their daily lives. The research is published in the Journal Of Urology.",

The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe. 'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said. China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build . 'It's a very difficult system to make operational.' A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher. Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University. The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write.

A group of Nevada sex workers, Hookers For Hillary, have come out in favor of the Democratic contender for president . According to their website, they\u2019re supporting the former secretary of state because of her work on health care reform, foreign relation experience, tax reform and responsible government oversight on public health issues. 'Hillary Clinton, as part of her husband's administration, envisioned health care reform in the 1990's, long before President Obama was able to sign it into law,' they write. 'The Affordable Health Care Act made health insurance available for the first time ever to the 500 independent contractors employed by Dennis Hof. With any Republican nominee likely to work for its' repeal, the Bunnies want to protect the quality health coverage that they now enjoy.' 'As Secretary Of State, Hillary Clinton gained invaluable experience negotiating with foreign leaders, and the Bunnies can definitely relate to negotiating through a language barrier,' they state. The group cite Clinton's work on health care reform, foreign experience, tax reform and responsible government oversight on public health issues as reasons to vote for her . The hookers all work at Dennis Hof's Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Carson City . 'The Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will.' 'Bill Clinton presided over the most prosperous time in Bunny Ranch history, which coincided with a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans such as brothel owner Dennis Hof,' the Bunny Ranch writes. 'The Bunnies recognize that thriving economies are built from the bottom up, where the vast majority of their clients originate. 'A return to relying on the disproven theory of trickle-down economics would only serve to exclude the vast majority of hard-working Bunny Ranch clients from having the discretionary income to enjoy with their favorite Bunny.' Citing Nevada's mandatory testing of legal prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases, the Bunny Ranch also applauded Mrs. Clinton for recognizing 'the fact that responsible government oversight is a key to protecting the public's health from widespread disease.'",

After next month's election, ministers could be asked to make sure Easter Day always falls between April 9 and 15, so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season. In 1928, the Easter act was passed in Parliament to make sure that the holiday weekend would be a fixed date in April. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and his wife Samantha attend an Easter Sunday service at St Nicholas Church in Oxfordshire. After next month's general election, minister could be asked to consider fixing the date of Easter . Both the House of Commons and House of Lords passed the Act but it was unable to get the agreement of churches and therefore has never been implemented. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church did not object to the plans although, they were never seriously discussed. But just before the dissolution of Parliament last week, Conservative Sir Greg Knight, who is defending his East Yorkshire seat at the general election, asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. This also prompted the National Secular Society to write to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding Easter be a set date in April. Pope Francis leads Easter Mass in St Peter's Square in the Vatican. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church do not object to the plans to fix a date for Easter . The letter by the society's executive director Keith Porteous Wood, said: 'The variation of the date of Easter by over a month causes significant and unnecessary inconvenience. This is particularly disruptive to the orderly planning of school terms and to business. 'As you will be aware, the law requires large shops, including supermarkets and even DIY stores, to close on Easter Sunday. 'The high proportion of the population that are not observant Christians, be they religiously unconcerned or of other faiths, are prevented from using them then, when many would want to do so. 'We support the rights of those who wish to observe Easter, but is is unreasonable and disrespectful to the remainder of the population for the operation of the law to prevent them from shopping then in such outlets.' Spectators gather to watch the The Passion of the Christ production on Good Friday in Trafalgar Square.\u00a0But just before the dissolution of Parliament, Conservative Sir Greg Knight asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday always falls on the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon . The Local Government Association and the Family and Childcare Trust have also backed the plan, saying that at least the two-week Easter school holidays should be the same every year to allow parents to plan childcare. However, according to the Independent Business Minister Jo Swinson said there was 'no indication' that Easter would become a fixed date. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday is always the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon. The Paschal full moon is the first full moon occurring on or after the spring equinox, meaning Easter weekend usually falls any time between March 22 and April 25. But since this shifts from year to year, most people follow the calendrical spring equinox, which is reckoned as March 21. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Easter is determined using the Julian calendar and is always celebrated after the Jewish festival of Passover. This year it will be celebrated on April 12, next Sunday.",

Arsenal came out on top globally with 5.68million followers ahead of Chelsea (5.49m) and Manchester United (4.87m). But one country was missing: China \u2013 where the government outlaws Twitter as they seek to keep control of information and the media. Manchester United have over eight million followers on Weibo, almost double that of Twitter . Manchester City also have over eight million Weibo followers compared to 2.4million on Twitter . Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao are third on the list of clubs in the world with most Weibo followers . In Twitter\u2019s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans \u2013 just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000. Barcelona have 5.4million followers on Weibo, the fourth most of any club in the world . Arsenal have 3.6million followers on Weibo compared to 5.6 million on Twitter . United\u2019s support in China is no surprise as they have solid support across Asia on Twitter, but City punch well above their weight in China compared with the rest of the continent. Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter \u2013 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton\u2019s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez\u2019s side.

Bayern Munich are 13th, Real Madrid are way down in 18th \u2013 with 81,303 less followers than Tottenham \u2013 and Paris Saint Germain in 20th. And such is the popularity of the Premier League, Michael Owen has a staggering 3,074,148 followers on the site - which would put him 10th in the top 20 clubs list. With the popularity of football rapidly increasingly in China \u2013 in December 2014 the China\u2019s President made football compulsory for children and added it to the national curriculum \u2013 expect Premier League clubs to intensify their effort to grab a slice of this lucrative market. SportQuake provided the data and their founder Matt House said: 'With its thrilling brand of football, the Premier League delivers mass engagement for fans in markets all over the world. We can say with confidence that more Premier League teams will be active on Weibo next season. 'As always, football and the Premier League is leading the way with new technologies, but we expect follower figures on both Twitter and Weibo to balance out to reflect fan bases as the platforms mature.'",

The strips, produced by sportswear giants Nike, have caused a bit of stir across the pond, because of the decision to go with a black and white colour scheme rather than the traditional red, white and blue. But striker\u00a0Alex Morgan hailed Nike's design as innovative. 'The black and white are different from anything we've ever had before,' she said, before adding, 'You know it's not a lot of red, white and blue in the white one because they wanted a clean look. I think it stands out in the fact that it is clean and just simple and I love that.' Scroll down for video . (Left to right:) Tobin Heath, Alex Morgan and Sydne Leroux of the USA women's soccer team pose . T he USA women's soccer team have unveiled their new kits for the World Cup hosted by Canada in June . There has been some controversy surrounding the decision to use a black and white colour scheme . Nike spokesperson and global creative director Martin Lotti explained,\u00a0'We always design home and away as one story, so the focus was on the blue with some of the red (for the away), and then the focus on the home was white. 'If you look at it traditionally, actually, all the home kits are always white. So we're actually not changing the history. In face we are being authentic to the history where it's always a white kit.' Nike have opted to put the focus of the new kit on the feet first and worked their way up. The neon yellow socks or 'volt' in Nike parlance are aimed to draw attention to the bright blue cleats. 'It's the first time as well that (the kit) is fully integrated, so going from the boot right to the sock, then it fades from the volt into the white kit,' Lotti said, 'It's a real head-to-toe look.' The USA women's team kick off their World Cup campaign against Australia on June 8 with a group match in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Some people have questioned the decision to abandon the USA's traditional red, white and blue colours .

Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch star in the new season, which premieres June 21. Here's the plot synopsis, according to Den of Geek: . \"A bizarre murder brings together three law-enforcement officers and a career criminal, each of whom must navigate a web of conspiracy and betrayal in the scorched landscapes of California. Colin Farrell is Ray Velcoro, a compromised detective in the all-industrial City of Vinci, LA County. Vince Vaughn plays Frank Semyon, a criminal and entrepreneur in danger of losing his life's work, while his wife and closest ally (Kelly Reilly), struggles with his choices and her own. Rachel McAdams is Ani Bezzerides, a Ventura County Sheriff's detective often at odds with the system she serves, while Taylor Kitsch plays Paul Woodrugh, a war veteran and motorcycle cop for the California Highway Patrol who discovers a crime scene which triggers an investigation involving three law enforcement groups, multiple criminal collusions, and billions of dollars.\" Yes, please. The first season starred Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as a pair of Louisiana State Police detectives investigating the death of a young woman.

A known child sex offender has been arrested on suspicion of stealing a school bus and driving it around to pick up youngsters. Patrick James Fredricksen, 30 - who has previous convictions for unlawful sexual activity with a minor and impersonating a firefighter - was stopped on his way to one child's home in eastern Utah, police say. He had already used the bus's on-board list of children's names and addresses to try and abduct a young girl, they added. Fredricksen has now been booked into Emery County Jail for investigation of theft of a vehicle and attempted child kidnapping. He is also expected to face a charge of damaging a prison after breaking a sprinkler pipe inside his cell and flooding the booking area, said sheriff spokeswoman Janalee Luke. Fredricksen's crime spree is alleged to have started while he was laying turf for a landscaping firm at a baseball complex in Huntington on Monday. An employee at the site phoned the local sheriff's office to report a worker 'was acting strange' and had left on foot with a set of master keys to the complex. Shortly afterwards, a nearby funeral-parlor worker reported that his car had been stolen from the company car park. Audacious: Fredricksen is said to have taken an American school bus and driven it to youngsters' homes . He told police he had noticed a 'suspicious' person around the building' but was talking to a bereaved family at the time so 'wasn't too concerned', according to the sheriff's office. They claim Fredricksen was the thief and that he drove the car to an empty school bus, which had its keys inside. 'After stealing the bus and using a list he found in the bus containing names and directions [to children's houses], Fredricksen attempted to pick one child up at her home and was asking directions to a second child's home,' said the sheriff's office. He had been foiled in his first attempt to a child after parking the bus on the family's driveway, according to KSL News.\u00a0The girl's father got to the vehicle first and would not let her board after quizzing the driver. Fredricksen was eventually stopped by a sheriff's lieutenant following a report of a suspicious person driving a school bus in the Cleveland area of Emery County.\u00a0The lieutenant said he halted the slow-moving vehicle by pulling in front of it. The empty school bus, thought to be identical to the ones seen here in Utah, reportedly had its keys inside . Fredricksen, who has also used the names Pat Shelton and Patrick Fredrickson, is on Utah's Sex Offender Registry after pleading guilty in 2004 to unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Court records show he was separately charged in 2005 with sexual exploitation of a minor and dealing in material harmful to a minor but the case was dismissed as part of an apparent plea bargain that resolved another case against him. The following year, Fredricksen was living in Salt Lake County when he pleaded guilty to impersonating a fireman. He had previously worked as a volunteer firefighter for the Huntington Fire Department but was dismissed in 2003 for stealing clothing and equipment. After his dismissal, he pinned on a stolen badge and lent a hand at emergencies, the court was told. He discovered where the real firefighters were working by listening to a police scanner. He also stole firefighting equipment and used his fake status to rent an apartment and get credit, according to newspaper reports from the time. He was sentenced to 36 months of probation and ordered to have counselling.",

The 61-year-old Democrat has pleaded not guilty to eight bribery counts related to his close personal friendship with eye surgeon Dr Salomon Melgen, 60, according to a 68-page federal indictment unsealed this month and detailed in the New York Post. Perhaps the most embarrassing of the accusations is that Menendez used his influence to get visas for married Melgen's multiple young lovers abroad - including a Brazilian model who posed on the cover of 'Sexy' magazine and a Ukrainian actress who moved to Florida to live in one of Melgen's homes. Scroll down for videos . Corrupt? U.S. Senator Robert Menendez faces the possibility of 15 years in prison if convicted of eight counts of bribery for using his political influence to help a wealthy donor in exchange for nearly $1million in campaign contributions and gifts . Melgen's ladies: According to an indictment unsealed this month, Menendez helped donor Dr Salomon Melgen bring at least three mistresses to the U.S. on visas - including Brazilian actress Juliana Lopes Leite (left) and Ukrainian model Svitlana Buchyk (right) Menendez and Melgen met at a fundraiser in 1993, shortly after Menendez was voted into the Senate. The two quickly became close, with Menendez being invited to fly on Melgen's private jet and visit his villa in the Dominican Republic on several occasions. According to the details in the indictment, Menendez began helping out his rich friend in 1998, when Melgen wanted to fly a 22-year-old girlfriend - identified as 'girlfriend 2 in court documents - and her 18-year-old sister from the Dominican Republic to spend Christmas with him in the States. Claiming innocence: Melgen has also been charged in the indictment, in addition to other Medicaid fraud charges, pleading not guilty to both. He is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami . Despite Melgen writing a letter to the embassy in Santo Domingo, the sisters' applications were initially denied due to the fact that they were unemployed and therefore more likely to overstay their visas. When Melgen found got the bad news, he reached out to his friend Menendez for help. Menendez then told his senior policy adviser Mark Lopes that he planned to personally call the ambassador and, if that didn't work, a contact at the State Department. An unidentified high-ranking member in the State Department allegedly responded by telling Menendez that he agreed with the visa decision. Nevertheless, a few weeks later the sisters were re-interviewed and this time their visas were approved. Lopes emailed a colleague after and wrote that it was 'ONLY DUE to the fact that RM intervened.' Menendez next helped Melgen in 2007, when the doctor was trying to get another young woman to visit him in the U.S. The woman identified as 'girlfriend 3' in court documents is described as a Ukrainian actress and model who was 20 years old and living in Spain around the time at Menendez intervened in her immigration process. According to the indictment, a Menendez staffer reached out to the U.S. consul general in Madrid on behalf of a 'famous person in Spain' who was a 'good friend' of Melgen and needed a visa to 'undergo medical evaluation for plastic surgery in the U.S'. 'Dr Melgen is a person of the highest caliber,' Menendez wrote . 'He is a fine citizen and held in high esteem by his peers.' It's believed that 'girlfriend 3' is model Svitlana Buchyk, now 28, a woman who has been tied to Melgen and who lived in Spain before moving to Florida. Svitlana made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car that was registered in Melgen's wife's name. At the time, Buchyk gave police Melgen's address in North Palm Beach as her own. When contacted the the Miami Herald at the time, she told the paper that she worked for Melgen in the past but would not describe what that work involved. 'He treated me well,' she said. 'He had money. He was very generous.' She now allegedly goes by the name Lana Moyzuk and lives in Los Angeles. Employee? Melgen's alleged mistress Svitlana Buchyk (pictured) made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car belonging to Melgen's wife. She told the Miami Herald at the time that she used to work for Melgen, but would not saw in what capacity . It appears Melgen may have been juggling women in 2007, when he brought Buchyk to the U.S., since he also reportedly started dating a famous Brazilian actress that same year. Menendez is also accused of intervening to help this woman to the U.S. a few years later, when she wanted to study law at the University of Miami. The Post has identified \u00a0'girlfriend 1' as 34-year-old Juliana Lopes Leite, who once appeared on Brazil's version of Big Brother and posed nude in several magazines before her move to the U.S. to become a lawyer. The indictment says Menendez knew Leite was one of Melgen's paramours when he agreed to help with her visa application, ordering his adviser Lopes to write a letter in the woman's favor to the State Department. In the letter, lopes wrote that Leite '(no relation to me) \u00a0has her visa application appointment in Brasilia, Brazil, tomorrow . . . Sen. Menendez would like to advocate unconditionally for Dr. Melgen and encourage careful consideration of [Girlfriend 1]\u2019s visa application.' The State Department got back to Menendez's office in just a few hours later and the following day Leite's visa was approved. She graduated from the University of Miami in 2011, and still resides in the city as a lawyer. Melgen is also facing charges in the indictment unsealed this month, in addition to separate 76-count indictment for Medicaid fraud. He remains behind bars at the Federal Detention Center in Miami after being deemed a flight risk. Meanwhile, Menendez continues his role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has raised $1.3million for his legal defense fund.",

Nick Clegg made a desperate bid to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith yesterday by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician'. He claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the Liberal Democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys. In fact Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib Dem grandee in the years before he died. Mr Clegg was accused on a radio phone-in of having 'washed his hands' of the issue by refusing to order a party investigation into Smith. He insisted there would be no inquiry despite revelations in Saturday's Daily Mail that the Liberal party \u2013 a forerunner to the Lib Dems \u2013 offered hush money equivalent to a month's wages to an activist after she complained about Smith molesting a teenage boy in 1979. Mr Clegg was confronted over the Smith scandal during a phone-in show on LBC radio yesterday. He was asked by 'John from Bexleyheath' why the Lib Dems had not investigated despite new details of Smith's prolific paedophilia exposed in this paper's serialisation of Labour politician Simon Danczuk's book about the late Rochdale MP. Mr Clegg attempted to distance the Lib Dems from Smith and said 'any political party' should co-operate with the police inquiry. He said: 'As it happens, Cyril Smith, as you may know, the allegations surrounding him, actually go right back to the time when he was a Labour politician, back, well before I was even born, I think.' Mr Clegg accused Mr Danczuk of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. He added: 'Cyril Smith was active in politics, by the way, in a party which no longer exists \u2013 the Liberal party. 'So he was a Labour politician, and then he was a politician for most of his career, for a Liberal party, which no longer exists. All this happened well before the Liberal Democrats were even formed.' Mr Clegg said the only way to get justice was for the police to investigate and blamed them for not having done so. Mr Danczuk, the Labour candidate for Rochdale, said his book made it clear that Smith had started out as a member of the Labour party. Nick Clegg made a desperate attempt to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith today by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician' He added: 'Nobody will be surprised to hear that Nick Clegg is being disingenuous in his comments. Mr Clegg accused Labour's Simon Danczuk (pictured) of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that actually Cyril Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. 'I urge him to face up to the fact that one of his colleagues \u2013 somebody who he and other members of his party celebrated for very many years \u2013 was a paedophile. 'I think it is a disgrace to try to avoid tackling this issue and to try to politicise this issue in the way that he is doing.' Smith was elected as a Liberal MP in 1972, but after the Lib Dems were formed in 1988 took the whip of the new party until his retirement from Parliament in 1992. He remained a Liberal Democrat grandee up to his death in 2010 at the age of 82. A gushing video tribute from Mr Clegg was played at Smith's 80th birthday party at Rochdale town hall in 2008. The Lib Dem leader told him: 'I'm a great admirer of you personally, but also owe you a great debt of gratitude politically too.' The Daily Mail's serialisation of Mr Danczuk's book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, revealed that senior Liberals were made aware of the paedophile MP's abuse. Lord Steel, who as David Steel was Liberal leader from 1976 until 1988 and nominated Smith for a knighthood, was alerted in 1979 to claims that Smith had subjected boys to humiliating spankings but Smith denied any wrongdoing. Senior Lib Dems including the Business Secretary Vince Cable and the former leader Charles Kennedy have insisted they heard nothing. The party has been accused of 'squirming' over the issue.",

Ride Like The Wind won just one of his four starts last season but he has run twice this term, posting a career best on his most recent start when landing the Group Three Prix Djebel by a head. French trainer Freddy Head likens his 2,000 Guineas hope Ride Like The Wind to Charm Spirit . Both the runner-up that day, Make Believe, and the fifth home, Sinfonietta, could reoppose in the Guineas to make it a three-pronged French assault on the 2,000 Guineas. Head said: \u2018Ride Like The Wind will run in the 2,000 Guineas. He has done very well since his last race, his work has been good, and I think that he has improved a bit. \u2018He is on the same sort of level as Charm Spirit was at this time last year. They are similar horses in that they tend to be a bit keen and if Ride Like The Wind settles better than Charm Spirit did last year I think that he has a good chance. Head says Ride Like The Wind is 'on the same sort of level' as Charm Spirit was at this time last year . \u2018That is why I have given him two runs already this season, to get the freshness out of him before the Guineas. 'I was very happy with his Prix Djebel victory. He settled then quickened well and it was to his credit that he won despite being held up at the back of the field when the pace was slow. 'The undulations at Newmarket won\u2019t be a problem for him and although seven furlongs is a good trip for him at the moment I think that he will stay a mile as long as he relaxes.\u2019 The Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained pair of Gleneagles and Highland Reel head the 2,000 Guineas entries. Also still in contention are the three winners of last week\u2019s Classic trials \u2013 Kool Kompany (Craven Stakes), Home Of The Brave (Free Handicap) and Muhaarar (Greenham Stakes). Gleneagles and Highland Reel, both trained by Aidan O\u2019Brien, lead the entries for the 2,000 Guineas . Roger Varian\u2019s impressive Newbury winner Intilaaq could still be supplemented to the Guineas. Connections would have to pay \u00a330,000 on Monday to add him to the line-up. One colt who is looking likely to be supplemented to the 2,000 Guineas field is Godolphin's Territories, who has pleased Andre Fabre since winning a Group Three at Longchamp. A statement on Godolphin\u2019s website quoted Fabre as saying: \u2018Territories has come out of his trial very well and has come on for the run. At this stage, a supplementary entry in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket is under serious consideration and we are 90% certain to take that route, subject to the horse continuing to please me.\u2019",

Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws, The Courier-Mail reports. Mr Morris says he wasn't driving when his Volvo was photographed doing 57km/h in a 50km/h zone last year. But he won't say who was behind the wheel. He has invoked a spousal privilege case from 1817, arguing it's unconstitutional for a Queensland court to fine him when there's evidence he was not the driver. Scroll down for video . Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws . He says he was in a meeting with top judges when the Volvo was snapped, and they are willing to testify that he was with them. He argues the spousal privilege principle, established in England 200 years ago, means a husband can't be compelled to provide information that incriminates his wife. 'I decline to identify the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the relevant time,' Mr Morris reportedly wrote in a letter to the Department of Transport. Earlier this year, Mr Morris wrote to federal, state and territory attorneys-general saying he planned to challenge parts of Queensland's speed-camera laws.

In a photograph revealed by the Sunday\u00a0Mirror, the 20-year-old is seen taking a drag from the large orange pipe \u2013 containing fruit-scented tobacco and smoked through hot coals via a tube \u2013 in a picture published in the Sunday Mirror. Sterling recently snubbed a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract at Anfield amid fears he could leave the club this summer. Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe . The 20-year-old (second right) recently snubbed a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer from the Merseyside club . The England international (right) played in the Red's FA Cup quarter final win over Blackburn on Wednesday . Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was snapped on a social media site with the picture captioned \u20181 down 3 to go\u2019, suggesting there was more puffing in store for the youngster that night. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes. Having already irked certain Reds fans for refusing to dedicate his immediate future to Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team after being offered the improved contract offer, he could again cut an unpopular figure for putting his health at risk during the Merseysiders\u2019 run in to fight for a top four place in the Premier League. Sterling (second right) attended the launch of the 2015-16 Liverpool kit at Anfield on Friday afternoon . There was a large turnout for the launch of the new kit,\u00a0which will be worn throughout the 2015-16 season . On the The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: \u2018Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' However Sterling is not the first England international to be caught indulging himself in the increasingly popular fad. Jack Wilshere became embroiled in his third smoking controversy in 15 months after a picture emerged of the Arsenal midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub in February. The 23-year-old was recovering from ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during a defeat by Manchester United in November last year. Choosing to keep his disciplinary plans private at the time of Wilshere's misdemeanour, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger was clear about his views on players that choose inhale potentially harmful substances. England and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) was involved in a smoking controversy back in February . 'I disagree completely with that behaviour,' the Frenchman said. 'When you're a football player you are an example and as well you don't do what damages your health. 'When you go out socially [and smoke] you as well damage your reputation as an example.' Depending on the result in the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon, Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates could close the gap between themselves and fourth placed Manchester City to four points if the Blues fall to their local rivals and if they defeat Newcastle on Monday.",

Jamie Jewitt, 24,\u00a0and Henry Rogers, 22, both admit that when they were in their teens, their self-esteem was at rock bottom. Henry, from Ealing, reached eighteen stone at his heaviest.\u00a0Before he made his foray into modelling, Henry, 22, was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. Scroll down for video . Henry Rogers, 22, hit 18st at his heaviest, left, but went on an intense two-year diet, including going vegan for a year, and now he's a sought-after model, right . At this point, he was keen to pursue a career in rugby, which was his passion. However, after reaching 18st, he decided to embark on a strict diet and after shedding the pounds and slimming down to 12st, he landed a job at Abercrombie & Fitch, where he was scouted by top agency, Models 1. His best friend Jamie Jewitt, 24, from Essex,\u00a0weighed 15st before his 15th birthday. Jamie was so self-conscious with his looks, he barely posed for any photographs and has hardly any snaps from his teen years. Before he made his foray into modelling, left, Henry was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. After shedding the weight, he landed a job in Abercrombie & Fitch and his career sky-rocketed from there, right . The men are using their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the 'shame' around body image and insecurity amongst men . After two years of intense and solid training - which included following a strict vegan diet for a year - he shed the excess weight and now weighs 12st. After he shed the weight, his family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked. The first casting was unsuccessful and he focused on his education. But fearing that he'd feel defeated, his parents encouraged him to go to a second casting. He was successful and moved out to New York alone to pursue his career in modelling. Despite initial setbacks, the pair  have since fronted campaigns for Tom Ford, Armani, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana.

The duo have even ventured into the world of reality TV, starring on New York's answer to Made In Chelsea, Taking New York. The boys have, however, left the show to focus on their modelling careers. And now, they say they want to use their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the \u2019shame\u2019 around \u2018body image\u2019 and \u2018insecurity\u2019 amongst men. So why do some men struggle to talk about body insecurities? Jamie and Henry think it is a 'masculine thing'. Discussing the topic, Jamie said: 'This year we have seen women leading the way. The likes of the Spice Girls encouraged the \"feel good\" movement. They encouraged women coming together and celebrating \"body beautiful\". 'But, for men, we are all too cowardly to talk about body image and insecurities. Even though we are all feeling it, we are not having those discussions down the gym. You don\u2019t want to be that guy that gets a tough time from your mates for talking out. It is silly really.' After he shed the weight, Jamie's family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked - and he managed to get spotted and now stars in the biggest designer's campaigns . The pair want to use their newfound platform for the better and are getting set to promote healthy male body image in a photoshoot with Attitude/Ateen coming out in June . Henry added: 'For some reason men don\u2019t feel like they can admit that they are insecure about their looks, that they don\u2019t feel the same pressures that women do. But with all the women paving the way for us and speaking out so confidently about their insecurities, we thought, why not admit to the world that we\u2019re not always comfortable in our skin either. 'Where are the male celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? There aren\u2019t any. Where are the female celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? Everywhere. 'From Pink to Kelly Clarkson. Women are out there talking loud and proud. We are letting the side down.'

The legendary guitarist and vocalist released a statement thanking those who have expressed their concerns. \"I'm feeling much better and am leaving the hospital today,\" King said in a message Tuesday.

But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video . Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant . Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom . The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail . An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna . Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations . This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in . Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations . 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at \u00a33.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'",

The 24-year-old Belgian has scored 18 goals across all competitions for his club this season, helping the Blues win the Capital One Cup and putting them on the brink of a first Premier League title since 2010. He was rewarded for his sterling performances with the top individual award of the night at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. Victory in their next two games - at Leicester and at home to Crystal Palace - would see Chelsea wrap up the championship. Eden Hazard poses with the PFA trophy after winning the award with a superb season in a Chelsea shirt . The 24-year-old Belgian poses with the trophy after collecting the gong at a glittering award ceremony at London's Grosvenor Hotel . Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille in 2012 and put pen to paper on a new five-and-a-half-year deal with the club in February . Didier Drogba posted this picture on Instagram  of Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Hazard, John Terry and Cesc Fabregas . John Terry posted this photograph with Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and Gary Cahill at the PFA Awards ceremony . Hazard has remarkably won Player of the Year or Young Player of the Year every season since 2009 with Lille or Chelsea. Hazard said of his award success: 'I'm very happy. One day I want to be the best and what I did this season is play very well, Chelsea played very well. 'I don't know if I deserve to win but it is good for me. 'It is good, it is better to be voted by the players - they know everything about football. This is good. I'm very happy.' He took the Young Player of the Year prize 12 months ago, and has rapidly progressed to the top award. 'We are almost champions, maybe this is the key,' said Hazard. 'Last season we finished third and this season we have an opportunity to win the league. This has changed from last season. 'I continue like I did last season - I try to be the same. I try to score more goals than last season. Personally I have played a good season, I have been there in the big games and I scored a lot of important goals, this is why I'm better this season.'

He picked out that moment as one of his best of the campaign. Asked to describe his season in a single word, Hazard struggled. 'I don't want to say 'amazing' because it is not finished yet - maybe amazing!' he said. 'I started the season not to be the PFA player of the year but it was in my head - I want to be the best and I hope one day I can win a lot of trophies. 'I just want to say thank you to the players who voted for me - it is always good to have an individual trophy but the most important thing is to win the league. 'I hope I can win a lot of trophies again - the most important is to win the league, without my team-mates I would not be here.

Hazard is embraced by team-mates after giving Chelsea the lead against Arsenal in October . Hazard has already won silverware this season, with the brilliant Belgian clutching the Capital One Cup with countryman Thibaut Courtois . Hazard (front) skips past the challenge of Manchester United's Wayne Rooney as the Chelsea man launches another attack . Mourinho has long sung the praises of the 24-year-old, believing he is rivalled by only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the global order. 'I had lots of stars, but he is the humble star,' the Portuguese said last weekend. 'He knows that he is one of the three best players in the world, the responsibility that comes (with that) and he is coping with that responsibility. 'He understands that his talent is fundamental for the team.' Hazard was earlier on Sunday named in the PFA Premier League team of the year - for the third time in his three seasons in England. He was one of six Blues players in the XI, along with captain John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa. The PFA Premier League Team of the Year for the 2014-15 season was announced ahead of Hazard being named Player of the Year . Hazard has benefited from working with Mourinho, with the Portuguese coach adding grit to his naturally flamboyant game . Ivanovic, though, was in no doubt as to the team's most influential cog. The Serbia defender, speaking about Hazard last week, said: 'He has been our most important player since day one. 'He is the guy who you just have to give the ball and he will do everything. 'Sometimes he looks so impressive, like he is not from this world.' Hazard arrived at Stamford Bridge in June 2012 - having been crowned Ligue 1 player of the year in each of his final two campaigns with Lille - for a fee reportedly around \u00a332million. Tottenham's Harry Kane - the only English attacking player in the team of the season - took the 2014/15 Young Player of the Year award. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a remarkable rise to stardom, scoring 30 goals for Spurs in all competitions this term despite not being given a regular starting slot until November. He helped Mauricio Pochettino's men to the Capital One Cup final, and also scored 79 seconds into his senior England debut as a substitute in the 4-0 European Championship qualifying victory over Lithuania at Wembley last month. Elsewhere, Ji So-yun of Chelsea Ladies won the\u00a0PFA Women's Player of the Year, while\u00a0Leah Williamson of Arsenal Ladies won the PFA Women's Young Player of the Year. Harry Kane capped a tremendous breakout season by walking away with the Young Player of the Year award . Kane's fairytale season featured a goal at Wembley on his England debut, just seconds after coming on against Lithuania .

Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 . The high point of Burnley's season, so far, is the 1-0 defeat of defending champions Manchester City .",

Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry has been banned from driving after he was caught drunk at the wheel of his Ford Focus. Hendry, 49, rowed with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder before embarking on a drinking session which led to him driving through Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, where he was seen speeding, a court heard. Police followed his 10-year-old car as it crossed double white lines while the father-of-four attempted to drive home. Now the former Premier League player who had spells with Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City, must travel around on his bike, a court heard. Hendry of  Lytham St Annes, admitted drink driving on the town's Church Road on February 21. He was almost twice over the legal limit after drinking in a Lytham cocktail bar. His lawyer Gwyn Lewis told Blackpool Magistrates' Court that Hendry's current income was 'meagre' and he asked for extra time for his client to pay fines and costs until he can start taking his offshore pension in mid May. Mr Lewis said Hendry, who is out of work, no longer wished to pursue a defence of 'special reasons' as a forensic report revealed he would have been over the limit at the time he was breath tested and there was no evidence that his drinks had been spiked. Peter Bardsley, prosecuting, said that a police officer in an unmarked car saw Hendry at 1am pulling away from a junction at speed. He followed Hendry who drove above a 20mph limit and then a 30mph limit sometimes going as fast as 50mph. The officer ordered Hendry's car to stop and smelled alcohol on him. He was arrested and a breath test revealed 63 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath. The legal limit is 35. The court heard Hendy, who played for Blackburn Rover and Manchester City, was seen driving at up to 50mph while drunk after a row with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder . Argument: Hendry said he had rowed with Sarah Kinder, pictured. He has subsequently been arrested for allegedly breaking a restraining order . Mr Lewis said: 'Mr Hendry is a fit man and regularly cycles. He has not drunk for seven weeks before he was arrested. Playing career: Hendry captained Scotland and played for Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, and Rangers . 'He started what some people call a dry January following the death of his wife in 2009.' 'However he was in an emotional state that day-and he decided to take a drink. However he knows what he drank and still cannot accept the reading from the breath test.' 'His finances are to say the least complicated. He was made bankrupt some years ago. His income is meagre until he can start taking his pension in mid-May.' Chair of the Bench Marilyn Padgett banned Hendry for 17 months. He was also offered a drink drivers' rehabilitation scheme which will reduce his ban by one third if he completes it. He was fined \u00a3110 and the magistrate said: 'We have based this on the lowest level and it will be deferred for six weeks to allow you to start your pension.' He was ordered to pay \u00a3200 court costs and \u00a320 victims' surcharge. In 2010, Hendry was made bankrupt owing \u00a32.2m to friends, family and the taxman. Last weekend he was arrested after allegedly breaking a restraining order which forbids him from contacting his beauty technician former girlfriend Ms Kinder.

The veteran host was attempting to warm up the studio audience ahead of his show on Monday when he made the off-colour gag. Letterman had just opened up questions to the floor, and fielded the first query of the night from a college employee, reported the\u00a0New York Post. They asked what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates. Letterman, who was in 2009 forced to admit to string of affairs, said:\u00a0'Treat a lady like a wh\u2013e, and a wh\u2013e like a lady.' But the joke received a frosty\u00a0reception from the shocked crowd. After being met with stunned silence, the host attempted to recover by offering further advice to graduates to 'eat salad' and 'always be nice'. However, several audience members at the Ed Sullivan Theater were furious over the sexist joke. Retired Jerry Stockton, from Virginia, called it 'disrespectful to women' while another, who would not be named, said it had been an 'odd choice' for the first joke of the evening. The gag is thought to have been a reference to a saying by 1930s screenwriter Wilson Mizner. Scroll down for video . Joe Logan, 41, from Pennsylvania, told the New York Post:\u00a0'Younger people watch his show. We already live in a culture that objectifies women, it's not right to make a joke like that.' A Letterman spokesman said he could not 'confirm the accuracy' of Monday's failed joke and would not comment further. But a source close to the show insisted 'It got a big laugh.' Letterman carried on with the show which had guests including John Travolta and Amy Schumer, star of her eponymous Comedy Central show, 'Inside Amy Schumer.' Old friends: David thanked John for being his friend over the decades during Monday's show. It was during a Monday warm up that he made the gag . The Grease actor, 61, had tried to bring his son Ben on to meet his 'old friend' Letterman but the nervous youngster had fled the stage into his mother's arms. The host later offered some advice to Schumer and instructed her to 'do something now that you'll regret.' So the comedienne immediately lifted her dress and flashed... her surfing scar to a relieved-looking Letterman. In October 2009, the veteran host of the Late Show had been forced to admit to a string of affairs live on air  by a blackmailing producer. The host made the shocking revelation on his show that he had cheated on his wife, Regina Lasko, whom he had only married that March. He made the confession after becoming the victim of an extortion plot concocted by a then-CBS producer, Robert Halderman, who demanded $2 million in exchange for his silence over the affairs. Letterman is now planning to retire from the show after more than 20 years of hosting on May 20. Good times: David rubbed his forehead while Amy cracked up after he told her to do something she'd regret .",

'Unfortunately her condition will not allow her to play for the national team. Maria did everything she could to try and play in Sochi. However, at the moment, she just isn't ready.

But for one New York-based writer, the urge to stand in front of a mirror and poke at and squeeze her pores for hours on end became so bad that it actually started 'sabotaging' her life. In an inspiring essay for\u00a0Marie Claire,\u00a0Jenna Marotta, 27, tells of her experience with dermatillomania - a\u00a0compulsive\u00a0skin-picking disorder that left her face bleeding - and how she managed to overcome it. 'I'd descend \"into the mirror\" for up to four hours a day,' Jenna writes in the essay, explaining how her actions horrified her parents. 'I would nick and squeeze and yank at every clogged pore on my face.' Scroll down for video . Obsessive behavior: Jenna Marotta, 27, of New York, says her habit of picking at the pores on her face was so all-consuming that it became 'self-sabotaging' At first, Jenna was just looking for a way to break out of her binge-eating routine. As a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch, then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home. Her binge-eating cycle continued through college and after graduation, when she moved back home to her parents' house in Illinois. 'I knew I was bingeing while I was bingeing,' she writes, adding that part of the problem was that she would head to the kitchen whenever she felt bored. 'So I decided to find a new place to spend my ample downtime.' That place became her parents' bathroom, where her mom kept a stainless steel 10x magnifying mirror and an array of Tweezerman tweezers. Jenna's use of the tweezers started off innocently enough, with her plucking out stray hairs along her eyebrows. Then she started to become obsessive, revisiting her brows several times a day and moving on to other areas of her face, where she would use those same tweezers to clear out pores and remove ingrown hairs. 'At one point, I became convinced that there was a lone dark hair trapped under my chin,' she says. 'I could think of nothing more vital than removing this growth from my face. In the process of freeing the (probably imagined) hair, I dug an eighth-inch deep hole.' Getting better: After accidentally going ten days without touching her pores when she forgot to pack her tweezers for a trip, Jenna managed to move away from her bad skin habit. She still sees a psychiatrist . Jenna was aware that her skin-picking was growing out of control and visited a 'battalion' of dermatologists, who told her that her problem was psychosomatic. So she enrolled in an an outpatient program for mental health. But once the three-week program ended, she insisted she had her problem under enough control to move on her own to New York City. The problem was not under control, however. Though the dreaded magnifying mirror was back at her parents' house in Illinois, Jenna would still lean in close to her own bathroom mirror to pick at her pores. 'I would tweeze and squeeze, filling my garbage can with tissues dotted with blood,' she writes, adding that she would hide out in her bedroom to avoid seeing her roommate, who might question her about the bloody tissues she threw out in the bathroom. And she didn't stop at using tweezers. Jenna admitted that she's also 'attacked' her face with an extruder, an earring post, an unspooled paperclip, a pushpin, a toothbrush handle, the rough side of a nail file, lotion caps, and nail clippers. One of Jenna's most agonizing memories was when the writer had to interview Steve Carrell after picking at a cyst on her chin until it bled. She worried the blood wouldn't dry in time to apply makeup before the interview. 'The urge to self-injure just always pulses through my head and hands,' she says. 'And it's my go-to method of procrastination when I have a deadline.' Luckily, while travelling to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this January, Jenna forgot her tweezers at home, resulting in ten whole days during which she didn't pick at her face. Now, the 27-year-old says she has overcome her condition - and is working on being 'nice' to herself. 'I continue to work with a psychiatrist to stay on track since I first put the tweezers down,' she says. Dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterized by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one's skin. Some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged. Sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body. The condition is often categorized as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). It can lead to bleeding, bruising and infections. CSP will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour. The skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels. However, once the damage has been done, those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness. Although the damage that is caused can be very severe, the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out CSP again and again. Treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. Source: Anxiety UK .",

Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now. Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come. It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a \"revolution\") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe. They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape. We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided. The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed. And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official. That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden. \"If something serious isn't done,\" he warns, \"dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand.\" Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program. Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants. \"Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated,\" she recalled. \"Let's keep that in mind.\" Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home. That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort. And while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.",

Officers can be seen extinguishing the flames and administering first aid as they wait for paramedics to transport the injured victims to hospital, according to 9 News. Police rescue victims from a flipped Holden Commodore after a dramatic police chase over the weekend that ended in a serious crash . One woman claiming to be a passenger in the car desperately pleads with police to save her boyfriend, who is trapped inside. \u2018Get my boyfriend out!\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve got the ambulance coming ok?' the officer says. \u2018Just stay with us.' But rather than gratitude, some friends of the injured can later be heard threatening police. 'Take off your badge, let's go, come on' says a shirtless man who appears to be in in his 20s as his friends struggle to hold him back. A 19-year-old was hospitalised with a broken neck, along with the driver, 20, and another 17-year-old passenger, both of whom suffered bruising and shock. The vision was captured at a known hoon-hotspot in Yatala on the Gold Coast, where police were alerted after spotting a driver doing burnouts .

Mexican federal authorities arrested Juarez Cartel boss Jesus Salas Aguayo on Friday, bringing an end to the career of a criminal who was famed for dispatching his enemies with the use of dynamite. Earning the nickname 'The Liquidator' for the brutal and ruthless methods that earned him a place on the DEA's Most Wanted list, Aguayo is charged with multiple felonies including the distribution of narcotics, homicide and arms trafficking. Scroll down for video . Fearsome: Jesus Salas Aguayo, a former gun for hire and Jarez Cartel boss known for his brutal murders of rivals, was arrested on Friday by Mexican police . Mexican authorities link over twenty deaths directly to The Liquidator, including the 2009 murder of a state witness in El Paso, a 2010 car-bombing which claimed the lives of two federal police officers and a 2012 massacre of fifteen people in a Juarez City bar. In 2008 the Sinaloa Cartel declared war on the Juarez Cartel as it sought to take control of Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million people that sits on the border with El Paso, Texas. That year alone saw 1,600 homicides in the city, and Ciudad Juarez City achieved the title of the most dangerous city in the world for three consecutive years. Jesus Aguayo, also known as 'El Chuy\u00edn', led the assault on the invading Sinaloa forces, causing the bloodshed of narcos, Mexican authorities and civilians alike. A respected 'sicario' or hired gun, The Liquidator was known to have spoken of his ambitions to one day run his own drug cartel. In 2008 he was hired by the Juarez Cartel bosses, who sent him to Ciudad Juarez to take over command of La L\u00ednea (The Line), the cartel's street-level army of assassins, who were notorious for mutilating the bodies of their enemies and civilians alike. The Jaurez Cartel was formerly one of the most feared in Mexico, but is now all but extinct following a war with the Sinoala cartel, and high profile arrests (pictured, boss Ricardo Gracia Urquiza is arrested in 2005) The Juarez Cartel eventually lost the conflict after three murderous years, and today its agents are spread widely across Chihuahua state. Today Juarez City, once a lively and popular border town, shows the scars of a drug war that cost nearly ten thousand lives over the space of four years. Entire districts of the city are deserted, rare are the buildings not marked with bullet holes and there are sections where even the police dare not enter given the narcos' stranglehold on the territory. The arrest of The Liquidator occurred on Friday in his hometown of Villa Ahumada, some 80 miles south of Ciudad Juarez. A gunfight occurred as the task-force moved in to detain Aguayo and his two bodyguards, one of whom was killed in an exchange of fire. Following The Liquidator's detention, federal agents seized a number of items that were in his possession, including 2 SUVs, 4 quad-bikes, a large bag of marijuana, a heavy-duty assault rifle, US$20,000 in cash and some 17 mobile telephones. Danger: Soldiers stand guard atop vehicles along a road where Aguayo was detained last week . Aguayo had been cartel boss for six months before he was captured after taking over from\u00a0Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, arrested in October last year . Following his arrest, The Liquidators criminal associates fled northwards to the town of Buenaventura and the surrounding region, threatening local people with death if they did not help them in their plight. A number of complaints were made to the police from residents of the town. The Liquidator had only been in the top spot for six months, following the arrest of former Juarez Cartel boss Vicente Carrillo in October of last year. The arrest is expected to put an end to what is an already significantly weakened criminal organisation following its defeat at the hands of Sinaloa. Following a difficult 2014 for the Mexican government \u2013 a scandal-filled year topped by the disappearance of 43 students at the hands of local police in Guerrero state - the country's authorities have made a number of drug kingpin arrests. 'This government has neutralised 93 of the total 122 targets that it set out when it came to power', National Security Commissioner Alejandro Rubido told reporters following The Liquidator's arrest. Saturday saw the arrest of another cartel boss, Jos\u00e9 Tiburcio Hernandez, supposed leader of the Gulf Cartel that operates on the eastern end of the US-Mexico border. His arrest in Reynosa, a town which borders McAllen in Texas saw the sustained attack by over 60 armed criminals in 15 vehicles on the District Attorney's office in the town centre. The criminals laid siege to the building for over three hours without success in an attempt to prevent their leader's extraction to Mexico City, where he and Jesus Aguayo will both be formally charged with drug trafficking, homicide and multiple other felonies this week. The Juarez Cartel, which was founded in 1970, claims to be the first drug cartel to have moved cocaine into the United States by aircraft. The Barrio Azteca gang, which operates in a number of Texas cities including El Paso and Houston is aligned with the Juarez Cartel .",

The episode of An Hour with Ruta, which aired on independent TV channel LNK last week,\u00a0claimed that foreign children were being seized and fostered with Norwegian parents to strengthen the Nordic country's 'genetic material.' An introduction to the chat show argued that\u00a0Norway's Child Protection Service (Barnevernet) argued that it was deliberately targeting Lithuanian children which were seen as a 'sought-after commodity'. Lithuanian talk show An Hour with Ruta (pictured) has accused Norway of stealing their children in an attempt to tackle 'the highest rate of inbreeding in the world' It stated that 'In Norway, Lithuanian children are taken away from their parents.' An 'expert' on the controversial service told show host R\u016bta Mikelkevi\u010di\u016bte that the country needed fresh blood to combat its rates of inbreeding which she said had led to high rates of babies being born with birth defects. Neringa Ozolina, a Lithuanian based in \u00c5lesund, said:\u00a0'The birth rate is the lowest in Norway,' according to a report by\u00a0The Local. Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gra\u017eina Le\u0161\u010dinskiene (pictured) hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service . 'Inbreeding in Norway is the greatest in the world, and the same is true of the percentage of children born with Down syndrome and other birth defects.' Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gra\u017eina Le\u0161\u010dinskiene hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service. She claimed he had been taken from her after displaying what was deemed to be 'sexualised behaviour', which included frequent visits to the toilet and sniffing his hands. Dag Malmer Halvorsen, Norwegian Ambassador to Lithuania was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations form to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime . She is still fighting to have her son returned to her. Norway's Ambassador to Lithuania Dag Halvorsen admitted the issue of children being taken into care from foreign parents living in the Nordic country was a major concern in Lithuania. The problem is so widespread that Mr Halvorsen was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations firm to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime. 'It is said that there is a history of inbreeding in Norway and that there is a high incidence of Down syndrome among Norwegian children,' he told Norway's NRK channel. 'They argue therefore that it is important for Norwegian authorities to obtain fresh, foreign children, such as Lithuanian ones, to strengthen the genetic material.' Earlier this year Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman accused the services of acting 'like the Nazis' by not allowing a Czech mother of the two seized boys to talk to them in Czech. Russian authorities have also attacked Norway over its seizure of children from their Russian-speaking families.",

Analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the Home Counties. The potential goldmine in the Weald Basin, across Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, could meet up to a third of Britain\u2019s oil demand within 15 years, according to the consortium exploring the area. Scroll down for video . UK Oil & Gas Investments say they have discovered 100billion barrels worth of oil reserves in the Weald Basin, near Gatwick airport (pictured, the well head at Horse Hill) A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . This could reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia and could be a major boost for British industry at a time when the North Sea supply is dwindling. But industry experts remained sceptical of the claims, with one describing them as \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. Since 1975, of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the UK North Sea, only 45billion have been pumped out. It is believed another 20billion barrels can be recovered before extraction becomes too difficult. Experts warned last night that only a fraction of the Weald Basin oil may be accessible for extraction. They also claimed fracking could be required to retrieve significant volumes. Stephen Sanderson, the chief executive of UKOG, said the site at Horse Hill was 'world class' and had the potential for 'significant daily oil production' at this proposed drilling site . Horse Hill Developments consortium made the discovery during test drilling in a well five miles from Gatwick Airport. UK Oil & Gas Investments, which has a 30 per cent stake, said \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile \u2013 equating to 100billion barrels across the basin. At current crude prices, this could be worth \u00a33.7trillion. Stephen Sanderson of UKOG, which insisted it would not use fracking, said: \u2018By 2030, we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the UK\u2019s oil demand from within the Weald area.\u2019 Neil Ritson, of fellow consortium firm Solo Oil, said it was of \u2018major economic significance\u2019. If flow tests showed oil could be extracted, the production process could begin within 18 months, he added. US firm Nutech, which conducted the tests, estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted \u2013 up to 15billion barrels. UKOG chairman David Lenigas said drilling in the Weald could create \u2018many thousands\u2019 of jobs. Although the exploration site covered 55 square miles out of 1,100, he said the consortium was confident the entire region was oil-rich. Works: The well is situated in this container on the proposed drilling site . Exploration: Experts are now trying to work out how much of the oil will be properly recoverable . Mr Lenigas dismissed suggestions it would be hard to extract from the site, saying the ground was limestone which acted \u2018like a big sponge\u2019 and that \u2018you can effectively suck the oil out\u2019. The Australian entrepreneur, who lives in Monaco, is a director of 16 British companies \u2013 and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices. UKOG shares soared after the firm claimed to have discovered a \u2018world-class potential resource\u2019. However, Professor Alastair Fraser, of Imperial College London, said the claims were \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. A study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region, while the British Geological Survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil. Discovery: The Horse Hill site near Gatwick in Sussex, where a large amount of oil has apparently been found . Drilling: Exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile . Development: The site is owned by a number of companies including UK Oil & Gas Investments . The professor added: \u2018The question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so.\u2019 Malcolm Graham-Wood, of oil consultants HydroCarbon Capital, suggested residents might object to rows of onshore oil wells, adding: \u2018The question is can it produce oil? It is extremely difficult with a very low recovery rate. This is potentially interesting but I wouldn\u2019t attribute any value yet.\u2019 But Mr Lenigas said: \u2018To all those people who say I am hiking up the share price, I am not. I am just saying what the Nutech report says \u2026 I feel passionate that this is globally significant for Britain.\u2019 A Department of Energy & Climate Change spokesman said: \u2018The Government welcomes any new information which expands our understanding of the potential of the Weald Basin.\u2019 There might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the Home Counties \u2013 but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits. The Government owns the land under your house \u2013 meaning homeowners have no right to any oil found beneath them. Once oil has been found, oil companies pay the Government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits. The Government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted. The only way an oil company would pay the surface landowner is if it wanted to base its drilling site on their land. However, firms that undertake fracking, which is seen as a more intrusive and controversial method of extracting oil than simply drilling, must sometimes agree to provide \u2018community benefits\u2019. This could include building a playground or school nearby the fracking site, and is seen as compensation for residents. Oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area, as well as gaining planning permission from the local council. Oil rush: The Weald Basin, of which Horse Hill is part, could contain a total of 100billion barrels . Mystery: It is not yet known how much of the area's oil will be easily recoverable . Boom: The Sussex countryside could soon be dotted with oil wells (file photo)",

The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday overwhelmingly passed the latest version of a bill known as the USA Freedom Act by a bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. The measure seeks to codify President Barack Obama's proposal to end the NSA's collection of domestic calling records.  It would allow the agency to request certain records held by the telephone companies under a court order in terrorism investigations. The authority to collect those records and other related surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act will expire June 1 unless Congress passes a law reauthorizing it.\u00a0The House bill would do that, with changes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . UNHOLY TRIUMVIRATE? CIA Director John Brennan (center), National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers (right) and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (left) will soon be handed new rules of the road for mass-surveillance efforts . REMEMBER ME? NSA leaker Edward Snowden is still taking refuge outside the US, nearly two years after exposing the depth of the agency's eavesdropping program . Republican Representatives Bob Goodlatte and Jim . Sensenbrenner, and Democrats John Conyers and Jerry Nadler . introduced the 'USA Freedom Act.' It would result in phone companies, not the NSA, collecting so-called 'metadata' on trillions of phone calls. Government agencies could get access to it by applying to a judge empowered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by . Democrat Patrick Leahy and Republican Mike Lee. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch . McConnell is seemingly out of phase, sponsoring his own bill to extend the PATRIOT Act \u2013 unchanged \u2013 until the end of 2020. McConnell said he intended his bill to be a starting point for legislative debate, not a complete solution. A similar bill to the one that cleared the Judiciary Committee passed the full House last year by a bipartisan vote of 303 to 121 but narrowly failed a procedural vote in the Senate. The Judiciary Committee chairman, Virginia Republican Rep.  Bob Goodlatte, said the bill's provisions had been carefully negotiated with both the intelligence committee and intelligence agencies. During the hearing, lawmakers said a deal had been reached to bring the USA Freedom Act to the floor without going through the intelligence committee, where many Republicans support continuing the NSA bulk collection. The NSA's collection and storage of U.S. 'to and from' landline calling records \u2013 times, dates and numbers, but not content of the calls \u2013 was the most controversial program among many disclosed by former NSA systems administrator Edward Snowden. CONTRARIAN: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is trying to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act without changes . Some NSA officials opposed the program, and independent evaluations have found it of limited value as a counterterrorism tool. Goodlatte said the House bill would create a 'narrower, targeted program,' that will still allow the NSA to hunt for connections between foreign terrorists and U.S. residents. 'We must act decisively to end bulk collection in the United States,' said Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat, in an Associated Press interview. 'For years, the NSA has collected our phone records, yet it cannot point to a single attack that the collection has stopped,' added Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who was one of the Patriot Act's original authors. Some lawmakers offered amendments they said would toughen the bill's civil liberties provisions, but those were voted down, with other lawmakers saying they would kill the deal and empower those who want to continue NSA phone records collection. A civil liberties group praised the bill. 'The USA Freedom Act of 2015 offers an effective path forward in reforming overbroad domestic surveillance and putting an end to the bulk collection of Americans' communications,' said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, in a statement.",

The 65-year-old told Diane Sawyer he embarked on hormone therapy and electrolysis, and had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine, shortly after winning the Olympic gold. However, he says, he stopped out of 'fear' of publicity and shame, and kept his secret to himself until he couldn't bear it any longer. Scroll down for video . Early signs?  Bruce Jenner has revealed he started having hormone therapy and plastic surgery in the mid to late 1980s to make himself look more feminine. He's shown here in September 1987 . Before the changes: Bruce, seen here on set, still had his athletic physique and heavy set masculine features when he appeared in the 1980 film Can't Stop The Music. These were noticeably gone by the end of the decade . Bruce said he was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. On Friday night, he publicly addressed about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. As the romance between Bruce and Kris blossomed in late 1990 and early 1991, the former star athlete  halted hormone therapy and underwent breast reduction surgery. The couple married months after meeting on April 21, 1991, and went on to have two children together - Kendall, now 19, and Kylie, 17, - before divorcing in December last year. Change of heart: Bruce halted his gender transition after meeting Kris Kardashian in late 1990. He stopped hormone injections and even underwent breast reduction surgery before the couple married. \u00a0He's seen here with Kris in February 1993 . Family man: \u00a0Bruce and Kris tied the knot in April 1991 just months after meeting. Seen here in 2000 with their daughters Kendall and Kylie, the couple were married for 22 years. Bruce found fame again with a whole new generation thanks to the reality series about their blended family Keeping Up With The Kardashians . A source quoted by Entertainment Tonight says that Bruce was greatly influenced by the life story of transgender tennis player Renee Richards. Richards, born a boy Richard Raskind in 1934, underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1975. In 1976, she launched a legal challenge after the US Tennis Association denied her permission to compete as a woman in the U.S. Open because she had not been born a woman and in 1977 the New York Supreme Court ruled in her favor in a landmark decision for transsexual rights. It's believed that her autobiography Second Serve, published in 1983, had a significant influence on Bruce. In 1986, the book was made into a TV movie starring Vanessa Redgrave who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Inspiration: Transgender tennis player Renee Richards won the right to complete as a woman in the 1977 U.S. Open after winning a landmark legal battle. Richards was born a boy in 1934 . Textbook transition: It's suggested that Bruce was greatly influenced by Richards' life story as outlined in her 1983 autobiography Second Serve. The Kardashian-Jenner patriarch and reality TV star addressed his gender journey during the two-hour prime time special airing tonight on ABC. He says: 'I wanna know how this story ends, you know? How does my story end?' In a message of support, TV's Dr. Phil told ET on Thursday that he's happy for the Olympian. 'This is his body and his life, and he needs to do what he wants to do,' said Dr. Phil. 'It drains your spirit if you can't be yourself. He is freeing himself.' The interview was conducted before Jenner was involved in an auto accident in which another motorist was killed. Nervous: Bruce Jenner is seen greeting Diane Sawyer at his home in the latest promo video released Thursday ahead of the airing of his sit-down interview in which he is expected to address his gender transition . Resolute: The former decathlete tells the journalist that it is 'going to be an emotional rollercoaster but somehow I'm gonna get through it' Looking to the future: The clip released Thursday concluded with Bruce asking, 'how does my story end?' Tight lid: ABC has only released snippets with non-specific quotes from Bruce, paving the way for his story to air in full tonight . Moral support: The 65-year-old father-of-six appears alongside his four oldest children  Burt, 36, Casey, 34, Brandon, 33, and Brody, 31; the latest clip reused this previously aired footage from another promo . Not appearing in the interview: Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Kourtney Kardashian, 36, as well as Kendall, 19, and Kylie Jenner, 17, are not scheduled to talk during the interview .",

On Wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no-one down. And that\u2019s the thing about Ramos. He very rarely lets anyone down. He is Real Madrid\u2019s Carles Puyol \u2013 the all-action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the Champions League final and heads in a corner that equalises Atletico Madrid\u2019s 1-0 lead in injury time, allowing Real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy. Ramos heads away from his own penalty area, but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield . The makeshift midfielder holds off Atletico Madrid's Koke during a superb display in the middle of the park . And when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against Bayern Munich in 2010 in the Champions League semi-final when he sent his kick \u2013 at least as far as Twitter was concerned \u2013 into outer space, he has the guts to take another one in the European Championship final a couple of months later, and not only score but dink it Panenka style over the keeper\u2019s dive. He has been mocked in the past for his Colemanballs comments that usually amount to declaring himself \u2018happy with the three points\u2019 after a cup game or \u2018looking forward to the second leg\u2019 after a league game, but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him. It always seemed that even Jose Mourinho during his fall-out with Iker Casillas could never really properly fall out with Casillas' ally Ramos because there was too much about him that he admired. Ramos too, while ultimately siding with Spain team-mate Casillas, always saw the worth of a bold and proactive manager. The Spanish centre-back celebrates his crucial, last-minute goal in last year's Champions League final . Ramos has shown character to bounce back from his errors, as his penalty for Spain in 2012 showed . His supporters believe he stands for a dignity that many feel is disappearing from the game. \u2018I like managers to be nice guys but I also like them to have balls\u2019 he said of Ancelotti\u2019s decision to play him out of his usual position against Atletico. \u2018We would both have never heard the end of it had we been knocked out\u2019 he said after that 1-0 win with him deployed to win aerial duels with Mario Mandzukic who Ancelotti had noted dropped back into midfield to get on the end of Atletico keeper Jan Oblak\u2019s drop kicks. Real now have nine games left if they reach the Champions League final. Ramos will play in all of them no doubt. He may even cover for Modric again with the midfielder not back for another five weeks; he will play as an auxiliary striker if Real Madrid need a late goal, and he\u2019ll go in goal if the emergency presents itself. Someone really should teach Real Madrid supporters that song: \u2018We all dream of a team of Sergios\u2019",

It\u2019s good to see, we haven\u2019t come back from being behind much this season. \u2018Jones is a presence, but he\u2019s more than that he\u2019s got good feet, he was excellent when he came on. He\u2019s very important in terms of scores like this and the situation the game was in. That\u2019s when he\u2019s probably going to play his biggest part. It\u2019s his job to turn those into points for us. He could be invaluable.\u2019 All it took was a split second lapse in concentration from Bournemouth\u2019s defence and they were behind in only the sixth minute. The first half was still taking shape when Daryl Murphy was afforded time and space on the right inside the box to bring a cross under control with a lovely touch and pass into Sears to fire in first-time. The striker, formerly of West Ham, was so free he looked over to the linesman, fearing he was offside, but the flag stayed down and he notched up his 19th goal of the campaign. Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski was diving left, right and centre for the remainder of the game to keep his side ahead. Twice he denied Ryan Fraser and again a powerful effort from Matt Ritchie. But Jones was thrown on in the 79th minute and rose to meet Ritchie\u2019s left-hand side corner to finally beat the Polish keeper. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy said: \u2019They put a very, very, very expensive acquisition on. He is pretty good in the air. I\u2019ve just watched it and Tommy Smith is head-to-head with him, it\u2019s one of those you get your head on it sometimes it flies in sometimes it doesn\u2019t.

Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, but no-one is able to get a grip at the top of the Championship table. \u2018I\u2019ve not known a league change hands so much,\u2019 Howe added. \u2018I\u2019ve not known it so tight. It\u2019s crazy. I said a few weeks ago there could be plenty more twists and turns. \u2018I think everyone is hoping they can be the team which breaks away. With so few games to go now it looks unlikely. It all goes down to the team who can hold their nerve the most and who can continue to avoid the pressure of what\u2019s at stake.\u2019",

Nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on May 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s. Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservatives, narrowly topped the polls assessing who 'won' the two-hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for Britain. Crucially, 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed Cameron as 'the most impressive' on the subject of the economy, which lies at the heart of each party's campaign. But pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be Cameron or the Labour Party's Ed Miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast. Scroll down for video . The build-up: Prime Minister David Cameron went head-to-head with six other party leaders in a TV debate on Thursday night in an unusual format for Britain. It comes six weeks ahead of the general election on May 7 . Neck-and-neck: Cameron was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out Miliband (right) Nicola Sturgeon, of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate, which also featured the environment-focused Green Party, led by Natalie Bennett, and Wales' Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party completed the line-up. Analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a 'killer line' that would set them apart from the other participants. 'There was clearly no knock-out blow,' said Peter Kellner of pollster YouGov. Jonny Tudor, 17, who asked one of the questions on the night, said afterwards: 'Some performed well in answer to certain questions, other performed well on different subjects, but there was no definitive winner.' A rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted Cameron to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets. Too close to call? Pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the Labour Party's Ed Miliband (left) or David Cameron (right) in the top job after votes are cast. But polls named Cameron as last night's debate 'winner' Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . Rare moment of drama: A woman stood up during the debate to heckle Cameron about homelessness . But in a result that will calm Conservative nerves, a Comres/ITV poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged Cameron was the most capable of leading Britain, compared to 28 per cent who named Miliband. The event was the first and only full TV debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters, many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy. It is the only time Cameron and Miliband will go head-to-head on issues of policy before votes are cast. In one of Cameron's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance, he pointed to his rivals, one-by-one, and said: 'What I'm hearing is more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes, some more debt and more taxes, and definitely more debt and more taxes.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was forced to reference mistakes he made in the last five years in coalition .

They reveal the country's rapid progress in constructing the runway on the contested Fiery Cross Reef which the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim. China's building activity in the Spratly Islands has infuriated neighbouring countries and the United States whose leadership accused the country of bullying others with its 'military muscle'. Images reveal Fiery Cross Reef virtually untouched by man-made structures in March 2014 but by March this year, it had been transformed into an artificial island which could be used for military operations. They follow equally disturbing photographs released earlier this month showing a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built island on the nearby Mischief Reef. Construction: Newly released satellite images reveal that China has built a runway (pictured) - which could be used for military operations - in a dispute region in the South China Sea . Disputed: China has built the airstrip (pictured) on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands without consulting the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan who all claim the region . Territory: The area near the Spratly Islands (pictured) where China is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region . Serene: Satellite images from August 2014 (pictured) show Fiery Cross Reef as a virtually untouched and beautiful natural sea-structure . Controversial: Whereas just seven months later in March this year, dredging ships can clearly be seen around the artificial island which has virtually destroyed the reef . The worrying photographs were revealed by security analysts Jane's Defense Weekly who claim building work in the nearby Subu Reef could create space for yet another 3,000m airstrip. And the same report suggested China was also working to extend a runway of that length in the Paracel Islands further north which is seen as a vital shipping route. More than \u00a33.3trillion worth of trade passes through the potentially energy-rich section of the South China Sea every year. The United States' military commander for Asia has said China could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the outposts it is building in the region, which would give it the power to enforce an exclusion zone. The images showed a paved section of runway 505m by 53m on the northeastern side of the reef which China began turning into an island with extensive dredging last year. China's ambassador to the United States has said it was 'natural' that his country's reclamation work would include military defence facilities. Cui Tiankai said there 'should be no illusion that anyone could... repeatedly violate China's sovereignty without consequences'. Its actions in the South China Sea have been described as 'aggressive' by Senator John McCain, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. Show of strength: Other satellite images released earlier this month showed a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built islands on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands (pictured) Force: Following their release, U.S. President Barack Obama accused China of using its military might to reclaim the contested territory in the South China Sea . He urged President Obama's administration  to move more military resources into the economically important Asian region - and boost cooperation with Asian countries worried by China. McCain claims Washington has a lot of work ahead to maintain its military advantage in the Asia-Pacific. He added: 'When any nation fills in 600 acres of land and builds runways and most likely is putting in other kinds of military capabilities in what is international waters, it is clearly a threat to where the world's economy is going, has gone, and will remain for the foreseeable future.' A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation and construction is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts. They said: 'We do not believe that large-scale land reclamation with the intent to militarize outposts on disputed land features is consistent with the region's desire for peace and stability.' Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki said China had a duty to address regional concerns And his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yong stressed the importance of stability in the South China Sea for trading nations like his. China's leadership has hit back at U.S. President Barack Obama who last week condemned the country for constructing an artificial island on Mischief Reef in another section the disputed South China Sea. Obama claimed Beijing was 'using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions' amid reports of controversial land reclamation efforts in the Spratly Islands. Worrying: A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation in the South China Sea (pictured) is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts . Territory: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands (pictured) and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty' Ownership: China claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea . But a furious Chinese leadership hit back by claiming that Washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle. Only hours before Obama's comments, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying added that it has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty', according to the BBC. She said the construction was to serve troops protecting the area, civilian activity such as search and rescue operations, scientific research and commercial fishing. Before-and-after images from the area show aircraft runways appearing from jungle, solid masses where there was once coral and man-made harbours replacing natural reefs. The country claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea. But the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have overlapping claims to the region. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The\u00a0Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake.",

The bat went flying and struck a fan sitting several rows behind the Cubs' on-deck circle in the face. Scroll down for video... Addison Russell was batting for the Chicago Cubs in the seventh inning during his first game at Wrigley Field . Russell, a rookie, swung at a first-pitch fastball and accidentally let the bat slip out of his fingers . The bat went flying and it ended up striking a fan who was sitting several rows behind the Cubs' on-deck circle . Cubs officials rushed to assist the spectator and towels from the home team's dugout were brought to the injured fan. Russell, who was ranked the No. 5 prospect in baseball earlier this month, said the bat 'just slipped', according to MLB. He said: 'I saw it connect with his face. 'I saw the dude's glasses fly, and it just wasn't pretty. I feel really bad. 'Words can't describe how bad I feel.'

A dog breeder and exhibitor who dragged her pet behind her car at a speed of 30mph and failed to get painful wounds to its paws and chest treated, has been banned from keeping animals and had her dogs confiscated. Deborah Fuller, 56, dragged her dog Tango for 400 metres behind her car as she drove along\u00a0the B1066 near Long Melford, Essex. The Rhodesian ridgeback was left with injuries to all four paws as well as grazing to his chest and a deep wound on his elbow. He is believed to have somehow escaped from the boot of her car and was dragged along the single carriageway because his lead was attached to the vehicle's tailgate. Fuller, of\u00a0Lawford, Essex, denied causing unnecessary suffering to an animal\u00a0by not taking it to the vets and failing to take steps to safely secure a dog within a vehicle, but was convicted following a hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. Fuller has also been banned from keeping animals for five years and had her 27 other dogs confiscated. Chairman of the bench Anthony Ealden said if Tango had been taken to the vet earlier 'unnecessary suffering' could have been avoided. He said: 'We believe for whatever reason, known only to yourself, you had no intention of getting veterinary treatment as a matter of urgency. 'We do not accept your reason for delaying treatment as reasonable.' The incident took place on June 11, 2014, when the dog was seen being dragged along the B1006 behind the car. Tree surgeons working nearby spotted what had happened and tried to get Fuller, who is a Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder and exhibitor, to stop her car. She didn't stop until she reached the end of the carriageway and they took her registration number and reported her to police who called the RSPCA, the court heard. Tango was later found by inspectors  in an outbuilding at Fuller's home with bandages on his paws. He was taken to a vet and given treatment for his injuries, which took eight weeks. Tango was left with considerable injuries to his paws and stomach, as well as a deep elbow wound . Tango, a Rhodesian ridgeback, pictured before being injured by being dragged along the road . Fuller claimed she had not been aware the rear hatch of her car had opened and claimed she had given the one-year-old dog first aid, and had already arranged for him to go to the vet when police turned up. Mike Fullerton, defending Fuller, said: \u00a0'When Deborah Fuller was being restrained she asked why she was not allowed to take the dog to the vet.' RSPCA inspector Sam Garvey said after the sentencing: 'Eyewitnesses report they saw the dog being dragged about 400 metres at a speed of 30mph. 'This must have been horrific for poor Tango. So painful, and so distressing. 'It is hard to say what caused Tango to be dragged behind a moving car in this way, but by the time we found him, seven hours later, he was urgently in need of vet treatment. The animal was taken to the vets and treated for the burns, suffered when he was dragged along the road . Judges ruled that the dog's suffering could have been avoided if Fuller had taken him to the vets earlier . 'He had injuries to the pads of all four feet, causing the black layer of skin to be removed. He also had grazing to his chest area and a nasty deep wound to his elbow and leg area. 'It took a period of eight weeks to heal the wounds and for his skin to grow back over his pads so he could walk without discomfort.' Fuller was also ordered to\u00a0pay \u00a33,000 costs, given a 12 month community order and a two month curfew from 7pm to 7am.\u00a0Tango was taken to a vet for treatment after being found and has made a full recovery in foster care. The court also allowed confiscation of all the animals owned by Fuller, which are currently in RSPCA care. Tango was removed from Fuller, along with more than 40 other dogs that were at her Essex home . Fuller and her partner Phil Sheldrake, 59, previously pleaded guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the dogs' needs at Colchester Magistrates Court in June. Earlier this month the case was thrown out after the High Court ruled that inspectors did have the correct warrant to seize 44 dogs from their Essex home. Tendring District Council had been granted a warrant to investigate 'nuisance' at the house, following complaints about noise and dog faeces. The council joined forces with the RSPCA and seized 44 dogs from the house, with the animal welfare charity claiming several of the animals were emaciated. However the trial was halted when district judge Kenneth Sheraton\u00a0said evidence gathered by inspectors was inadmissible because they did not have the correct warrant.",

Sheila Secker, 78, had been given the pay-as-you-go phone by her son, but as she had not used the phone for some time it had been cut off. When the grandmother collapsed in her home in December, she could not contact her family and died in hospital a few days later, the Sunday Times reports. Cancelled: As Sheila Secker had not used her pay-as-you-go phone for any chargeable services, Vodafone retired her number without warning . Mrs Secker's son Steve told the newspaper how his mother had owned the mobile phone for 14 years, and recently topped up the credit, but had not made any calls. Shortly before her fall, Mrs Secker moved into a new home, near York, and had yet to have a landline installed, so relied on her mobile. Mr Secker told the Sunday Times' Money section how the family raised the alarm the next day after not hearing from his mother, and emergency services were called. Mrs Secker died in hospital on New Year's Day. When Mr Secker contacted Vodafone he was told his mother's number had been retired, and that a 'glitch' in the system had allowed the elderly woman to continue to 'top up' her credit. Take heed: Most major mobile phone operators regularly 'recycle' numbers when they have been out of use for a three to six months . 'What I cannot fathom is, if Vodafone has retired a number, how can it permit money to be taken as a top-up,' Mr Secker, 46, told the Sunday Times. 'This is nothing more than a rip-off to add insult to injury'. Most major phone operators regularly 'recycle' phone numbers when they have been out of use for a certain time. A Vodafone pay-as-you-go mobile is put into 'semi-quarantine' if no chargeable calls or texts are made for 90 days. After a\u00a0further\u00a090 days the number is disconnected, and 270 days later the number is recycled and given to another customer, with any credit on the phone lost. EE retires a pay-as-you-go number after 180 days of inactivity and O2 disconnects a pay-as-you-go phone after six months of no chargeable services. Tesco Mobile allows six months of inactivity before sending the customer a text to remind them to use their phone again, or their number will be lost.",

Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, is facing extradition and is wanted by American prosecutors after allegedly causing the 2010 Wall Street 'flash crash' and making more than \u00a326 million using a fraudulent trading technique. Sarao, of Hounslow, west London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday and was bailed with a surety of \u00a35 million. Suspected rogue trader Navinder Sarao (circled) lived in his parents' modest home because it gave him a split-second advantage worth millions of pounds . Sarao (pictured in court) spent a third night in custody last night after failing to pay the \u00a35million surety demanded by the courts to grant him bail . However, he has remained behind bars since his brief appearance, and will remain there over the weekend after an official from the magistrates' court today said it had not received the money. The spokeswoman said: 'It hasn't been paid and it can't be paid over the weekend. He will therefore remain in custody until at least Monday when he is able to pay the money.' The former Brunel University student allegedly made \u00a3550,000 in five minutes on the day of the 'Flash Crash', the biggest one-day collapse in Wall Street history. He is accused of using computer programs to create 'spoof' transactions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and faces charges which could carry a 380-year prison sentence. It's claimed he did all this from his parents' semi-detached home in Hounslow, west London, where he ran his one man trading company. He was arrested at the address on Tuesday afternoon at the request of American prosecutors. Under bail conditions he will be tagged and he has surrendered his passport and must live at the family home - keeping to a curfew of between 11pm and 4am at that address. His parents have also agreed to surrender their passports as part of the bail conditions. A full extradition hearing for Sarao has been set for August 18th and 19th, with a preliminary hearing on May 26th. Sarao's family's semi-detached house in suburban west London (pictured), from where he traded . After his arrest earlier this week made headlines across the world, details of his life have been revealed by former colleagues. One of which told MailOnline today: 'He was a super human trader - we were in awe of his ability to make money. When he left Futex he took \u00a32.5million from his account with him. That was unheard of. 'We were all encouraged to set up offshore accounts. If he has as much money as people think then that's where it'll be.' He is said to have 'loved making money, not spending it', and friend told MailOnline he would make \u00a3250,000 a day trading. Despite his alleged wealth he would travel to work late so he could buy off-peak tickets, only have lunch if he could find cut price sandwiches and shunned drinking in pubs for pints of milk at his desk.

According to Ms Bartholomew, she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection. However the butcher who was working at the shop on Monday has hit back saying Ms Bartholomew is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night when she was buying a chicken for her and her Roosters star boyfriend Aidan Guerra to have for dinner . The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up. There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said. Ms Bartholomew claims the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi swore at her and told her to leave, but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude . The chicken (pictured in front of Aidan Guerra) was cooked by Ms Bartholomew as part of a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast . 'Another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash, and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own.' However, the butcher vehemently denies he called Ms Bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine. 'She's just a troublemaker,' the butcher told Daily Mail Australia.\u00a0'I was very slow and she started having a go at me.' Ms Bartholomew (pictured with Mr Guerra) said the butcher told her to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' But the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman (pictured) He told Daily Mail Australia that he's trying to fit into Australian life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in Bondi. Ms Bartholomew\u00a0claims the butcher then asked her 'Why don't you just go to a f***ing Aussie butcher'. 'She said I'm half Italian don't speak to me like that,' the butcher said.\u00a0'I said if you're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go.' 'It's a free country there's about eight butcher shops in Bondi,' he added. Ms Bartholomew (left) and the butcher both said she didn't end up paying for the chicken she and Mr Guerra (right) later ate . Ms Bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her. 'I said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to \"take it and f*** off\",' she claims. 'I think I was just the victim of racial abuse,' the young Bondi woman wrote in a heated Facebook post shortly afterwards. However the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage. 'She didn't even end up paying for the chicken, she got a free chicken,' he said. Ms Bartholomew told Daily Mail Australia 'I have never been to this particular butcher before.' 'I'm going to assume it wasn't me who he was really angry at, however I just happened to be in there at the time.'",

Video of the incident, recorded February 19 by the dashboard cameras of two Marana police cars, shows one of the cars running into a suspect with who had a rifle in the city about a half hour from Tucson. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. The footage has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" The video has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used to detain the man. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force, Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several incidents there the day he was struck. At 6:45 a.m. on February 19, Valencia allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in Tucson with a metal object in his hand. Authorities said he was dressed only in his underwear. He was charged with theft. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure. Just after that he entered a home and stole a car, police said. Authorities said he drove to a Walmart in Marana, where he allegedly stole a .30-30 rifle and ammunition. He fled the store with Walmart employees in pursuit. Police encountered him in a business park walking down the road. An officer told him several times to drop the rifle, Lt. Tim Brunenkant with Marana police said in an email containing a timeline of events. Valencia, police said, walked away from the officer, turned a corner and stopped. Valencia pointed the rifle at the officer then walked away again toward a Coca-Cola bottling plant and another business. \"As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created,\" Brunenkant wrote. Brunenkant also said by phone that before Rapiejko's encounter with Valencia, the suspect had pointed the rifle at his head multiple times and threatened suicide before fleeing. Rozema said that Valencia's firing of the weapon, his refusal to obey the first officer's commands to drop the gun and the pointing of the gun at the officer were key. \"And so you have another officer who sees and seizes an opportunity to end the threat and put an end to the situation,\" the chief said. Cohen-Metzger criticized the fact that Rapiejko hit Valencia from behind. \"My client's back was turned and the officer drove right into him,\" she said. \"It isn't that dissimilar to a police officer shooting a fleeing suspect in the back.\" CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer.

The Tangerines' demotion into the third tier was finally confirmed on Easter Monday and that triggered pre-match public displays of fury from fans at the Oyston family's handling of the club on Tuesday. Dozens of supporters gathered outside the West Stand 45 minutes before kick-off and hurled eggs at the back of the directors' boxes before a flare, smoke bomb and firework were tossed into the cordoned-off area in front of the main reception area. Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead against Reading on Tuesday night . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Blackpool: Lewis (Parish 73); Hall (Maher 50), Clarke, O'Dea, Dunne; Cubero, O'Hara, Perkins, Orlandi (Osavi-Samuel 78), Jacobs; Madine . Goal: O'Hara (pen, 6) Booked: O'Hara . Reading: Federici; Gunter, Pearce, Knight, Obita; McCleary (Mackie 45), Ake, Norwood, Robson-Kanu; Yakubu (Cox 78), Appiah (Pogrebnyak 45) Goal: Hall \u00a0(OG, 46) Ref: G. Eltringham . Att: 9,614 . With stewards and police present, the scenes did not descend into violence but the message delivered from those in attendance was clear - they want Oyston to depart a team that this week became the first in the Football League to be relegated. On the pitch, Jamie O'Hara's early penalty was cancelled out by Grant Hall's unfortunate own goal just 20 seconds after the restart as the basement-dwelling Seasiders' winless run was extended to 13 games. Some of the supporters who congregated in front of the West Stand did not even walk into a half-empty stadium for the game and they missed their side taking a sixth-minute lead. Zat Knight got the wrong side of Sheffield Wednesday loanee Gary Madine and tripped him from behind, allowing O'Hara to step up and stroke the resulting penalty into the corner as Adam Federici guessed the wrong way. Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . The cut-up pitch arguably denied the hosts a second as the ball bobbled away from David Perkins, who had orchestrated a three-on-two break, on the edge of the Royals' penalty area. Winger Michael Jacobs then blasted into the side-netting from 25 yards as Blackpool entered the interval with a one-goal lead. That disappeared 20 seconds after the restart, though, when the Royals made a lightning start to the second period. Pavel Pogrebnyak made inroads down the left flank and he squared for Yakubu, whose shot back across goal smashed against the unfortunate Hall before going over the line. Hall stayed on the turf and after woozily returning to his feet, he was replaced by Niall Maher. Perkins bent an effort narrowly past a post but Joe Lewis and Federici remained largely untroubled, as did Blackpool substitute Elliot Parish when he replaced an injured Lewis, with Pogrebnyak's header off target the closest either side came to a winner. The result leaves Lee Clark's side on 25 points, still one point shy of the lowest points tally ever accumulated by a team in the second tier when there have been 24 teams competing.",

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr\u00a0Prasanna . \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,\u2019 he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: \u2018Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c . \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O\u2019Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll and\u00a0Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr\u00a0Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.",

The shadow business secretary said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters. Mr Umunna's remarks come after Mr Farage dragged into a fresh racism storm after National Front members turned up to campaign for him in his South Thanet constituency. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters . The row started after a group of far-Right supporters calling themselves the East Kent English Patriots supported Mr Farage at an event in Broadstairs on Friday evening. They were led by Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League, and enjoyed the protection of Ukip's security teams, which encircled the Broadstairs Pavilion. Mr Field, who has a criminal record for assault, drank beers behind the cordon with fellow members of his group and gestured to onlookers as a crowd waited for Mr Farage's arrival. The Ukip leader moved to disown the far-right campaigners, saying: 'Members of an extremist group today arrived at a Ukip public meeting at the same time as a Mail on Sunday camera arrives.' But Labour's Mr Umunna, whose father was born in Nigeria, accused Ukip of whipping up 'anti-immigration sentiment'. Mr Umunna said: 'The likes of Ukip don't like what modern Britain is. They claim to love Britain, but they hate modern Britain. If I'm wrong about that why do we see a stream of invective directed at different groups in society from their candidates and their members? 'There is a virus of racism which runs through that party which they've failed to deal with, and I'm not surprised given their leader doesn't see the need for equalities legislation that we have in Britain today and that we're very proud of.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage, stopping for a pint in Ramsgate, Kent, was accused of having a 'problem with race' Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League (pictured in the white hat)\u00a0turned up to campaign for Ukip in South Thanet constituency last week . Last week, Mr Farage defended Ukip's manifesto, which featured only one ethnic-minority person, saying the party had one spokesman who was 'fully black' and another who was 'half black'. Responding to these remarks, Mr Umunna said: 'I just think the guy's got a problem with race. I'm just saying what I think. 'As a party they've got a problem with race. And I don't think you can kick out racism from their party unless you have got a leadership which understands it and understands race in modern Britain. 'I have no truck with this notion that immigrants are to blame for all of the country's problems. We saw people do that to black and Asian people like my father in the Sixties and Seventies, and now the group they're trying to blame for all their problems are Eastern Europeans.'",

Richard Curry, from Loveclough in Lancashire, was told he had malignant melanoma in his septum, the thin strip which separates the nostrils. He was warned that he would have to have his nose removed to stop the cancer from spreading but could be fitted with a prosthetic. Pensioner Richard Curry, who wears a prosthetic nose attached to his face using magnets, after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with cancer . But in order to make sure that the new nose stayed in place, the 71-year-old then had to have magnetic implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity during a procedure at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. And now Mr Curry has spoken of his shock at how successful the operation has been of keeping his new nose in place. He said: 'Losing my nose was something of a shock but I didn't have much choice because this kind of cancer is one of the most dangerous you can get. The 71-yer-old had a procedure to have metal implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity in order to hold his prosthetic in place . 'I ws just grateful it was caught in time and removed, and when they mentioned they could attach a new one with magnets, I just thought it was amazing.' Mr Curry's nose was removed in 2013, after he spotted traces of blood in a tissue, and the implants were gradually inserted of the course of the next 12 months. He added: 'In the early days I wasn't quite sure how much adhesive to put on, and my stick-on nose would sometimes fall off in hot weater, for example. 'And there was an incident in Asda which gave the girl on the till a bit of a shock. 'The implants were all ready last September and I was so pleased with the results. 'It's comfortable and it looks good, and I've even still got my sense of smell. 'I just need to get it touched up for colour every now and then, like before going on holiday so it matches my skin.' Mr Curry, a retired civil servant, who lives with his partner James Rogerson now wears his new nose all day but removes it at night when he goes to bed. A check-up last month found no signs of the cancer returning when he met with prosthetist Tony Simpson, maxillofacial surgeon Gary Cousin and ear, nose and throat specialist Paddy Morar. Mr Morar said: 'Cancers of the nose are not that common at all, you probably only get one every three years or so, so this was a very unusual procedure. Mr Curry's prosthetic nose, which is held on by magnets. Specialist Paddy Morar says it is fairly common to use magnets to attach prosthetic ears, but was the first time they had used them to attach a nose . 'Magnets are used quite commonly with prosthetic ears, but this was the first time we had used them to attach a nose. 'Richard couldn't have radiotherapy so it had to be surgery and we were extremely impressed by his attitude throughout, he's a very strong character and a model patient.

The New York Post reported in addition to being stripped of his badge, Detective Patrick Cherry will be placed on modified duty before being transferred out of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. 'No good cop should watch that video without a wince,' NYPD Police Chief Bill Bratton said at a press conference announcing Cherry was being placed on modified duty. Scroll down for video . Screaming and raging: Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . 'Because all good cops know that officer just made their jobs a little bit harder,' Bratton added. 'In that kind of encounter, anger like that is unacceptable. In any encounter, discourtesy and obscene language like that is unacceptable.' The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau launched an investigation into the incident, which occurred in the West Village, after footage captured by a passenger was posted online. The officer was named by the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Shell shocked: The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . Detective Cherry was in plainclothes and trying to park his unmarked Hyundai without signalling when the Uber driver known only as\u00a0Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his driving ability. Cherry's case was transferred to the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said Cherry was returning from a visit with his colleague Detective Harry Hill. Hill had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and Cherry was reportedly very stressed. 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health,' Palladino said. 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts at the driver, screaming, 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that.' 'That's not the way it works,' he continued. 'How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai . 'Our Uber driver, Humayun, was abused by a police officer today in New York,' Sanjay Seth, who took the video, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. 'The unending rage, door slamming, throwing items into the car, threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer's remarks at the end really took it to another level.' 'The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident,' Uber said in a statement. 'We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs.'",

Britain's biggest banks have racked up a \u00a339billion bill in just three years to pay for their financial scandals. \u2018Remediation costs\u2019 wiped out 61 per cent of their profits between 2011 and 2014, according to accountants KPMG. The bill has been driven by the payment protection insurance scandal, with banks setting aside \u00a34.7billion last year to compensate customers. Another \u00a32.3billion was earmarked by banks including Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC to pay fines for rigging foreign exchange markets. The total charge for wrongdoing last year \u2013 \u00a39.9billion \u2013 was only 8 per cent less than the previous year. Describing it as a \u2018problem that won\u2019t go away\u2019, KPMG said banks also face mounting costs from employing an army of compliance staff to keep them out of trouble. RBS is thought to be facing a multibillion-pound settlement in the US for mis-selling toxic bundles of mortgage debt \u2013 known as mortgage-backed securities \u2013 in the run up to the financial crisis. Barclays is also braced for a huge fine for rigging foreign exchange rates, having put aside \u00a31.25billion so far to cover the bill. But the UK\u2019s strengthening economy has driven a 72 per cent drop in losses from bad loans, with write-offs falling to \u00a35.2billion last year. RBS was boosted by \u00a31.4billion after not as many loans went sour as it had feared. This compares with an \u00a38.1billion charge in 2013. So-called \u2018impairment charges\u2019 at Lloyds fell \u00a32billion to \u00a3752million as the improving economy meant fewer retail customers and businesses defaulted on their repayments. Scroll down for video . This translated into a surge in the bottom line, with Lloyds posting a \u00a31.8billion profit, up from \u00a3415million in 2013. RBS\u2019s losses narrowed to \u00a33.5billion last year from \u00a38.2billion in 2013.\u00a0Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered all saw profits fall. KPMG said banks must \u2018urgently tackle\u2019 their low return on equity \u2013 a key measure of shareholder value \u2013 and need to invest in technology to increase their profits. Tougher regulations forcing them to hold more capital have made it more expensive for them to do business, especially in higher-risk areas. Banks including RBS and Barclays have responded by shrinking their investment banking arms. KPMG\u2019s Bill Michael said: \u2018Banks are undergoing a once in a lifetime change, as they face evolving regulation, technology and society\u2019s expectations \u2026 If further regulation creates too many strictures on non-retail banking, the industry risks losing its global relevance.\u2019 KPMG said banks must \u2018urgently tackle\u2019 their low return on equity and need to invest in technology to increase their profits.",

But not everyone was smiling after Sir Paul McCartney married Heather Mills. Take a closer look at Macca's wedding party picture and you'll spot his daughters Stella and Mary looking decidedly glum. Scroll down for video . The pair \u2013 daughters of Sir Paul's first wife Linda, who died of cancer four years previously \u2013 were said to have been less than overjoyed by their father's choice of partner. The remarkable picture is a portent of the bitterness that would follow the wedding in 2002 \u2013 as Sir Paul and Ms Mills separated in 2006 and went through a bitter and messy divorce in 2008. Astonishingly, the image is the first to emerge of the former Beatle and Ms Mills from their wedding reception. In another never-before-seen picture, Sir Paul acts out a mock striptease in front of his delighted bride during the reception, which was attended by 300 guests. Sir Paul, then 59, and Ms Mills had ordered a media blackout of the event in Ireland. These pictures belong to the family of Sir Paul's late housekeeper Rose Martin, who was among those invited to the event at the 17th Century Castle Leslie in County Monaghan. The ceremony was shrouded in such secrecy that on the invitations guests were told only to arrive at a hotel at Heathrow Airport at an appointed time from where they would be flown to an unnamed destination. Other guests included the only other surviving Beatle, Ringo Starr, the band's legendary producer Sir George Martin, Pretenders singer Chrissy Hynde, and model Twiggy. Sir Paul and Ms Mills are pictured (left) in 2003\u00a0at a screening for the film 'Concert For George' and (right) in\u00a0Hollywood in 2007 . The pair posed with photographer Dennis Stone (left) as they arrived back in London after a trip abroad . Sir Paul (left) and Ms Mills (right) went through a bitter and messy divorce in 2008 and are pictured leaving the High Court after one of their hearings . Mary (left) and Stella (right) McCartney join Sir Paul at the launch of Meet Free Monday seven years after his 2002 wedding . The couple turned down a \u00a31.5 million offer from Hello! magazine for exclusive photos of the event. One official portrait \u2013 of the couple outside the church \u2013 was published, for charity. These photos and other memorabilia, including the invitation \u2013 featuring Sir Paul giving Ms Mills a piggy-back \u2013 are being sold at Omega Auctions in Stockport, Cheshire, next month. Mrs Martin's family decided to sell them after her death aged 92 in 2013. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: 'They decided the best thing was to pass them on to fans.'",

Jim Ratcliffe, founder and chairman of chemical company Ineos, has applied to planning officials in the New Forest to seek to demolish an existing beach hut and replace it with a 'carbon neutral' mansion. The 62-year-old businessman who is based in Switzerland claims that the new house, if built, will be his only UK residence. The proposed beach house in this computer generated image would only be visible from yachts on the Solent . The high-tech planned mansion will be virtually 'carbon-zero' and uses renewable energy such as solar power . Billionaire tycoon Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a futuristic beach house on a site he owns overlooking the Solent . The planning application claims the building will be 'climate-change proof due to its jacking system. The building has been designed by Charles Morris, who was the architect responsible for the Orchard Room at Prince Charles's Highgrove Estate. According the document: 'The development proposals incorporate domestic-scale micro renewable energy systems, including an array of photovoltaic cells, solar hot water and an air source heat pump. 'The solar thermal hot water system provides hot water powered directly from the sun; the photovoltaic cells will provide electrictiy to power immersion heaters to ensure that there is hot water in all weather conditions. 'The air source heat pump will draw latent heat from the air even when air temperature is as low as -25C to heat the house via underfloor heating. 'The dwelling would be so thermally efficient and would harness so much renewable energy that it will not need a boiler. 'The dwelling has been designed to be lifted by 73 piston jacks, with with a capacity to lift 25 tonnes; this will allow the development to respond to rising sea levels over the next 100 years, this is truly innovative and truly unique.' Mr Ratcliffe is seeking to demolish the existing house on the site and replace it with the new mansion . The house has a revolutionary jacking system which can lift the property up in the case of flooding . The \u00a34million luxury mansion will have stunning views of the Isle of Wight and is at the edge of the New Forest . Mr Ratcliffe bought the site in 2005 and has had several previous planning applications rejected. According to the plans, the house would only be visible from yachts on the Solent. His neighbours include Dire Straits lead singer Mark Knopfler and the band's bass guitarist John Illsley who live either side of the planned development. Graham Baker of the New Forest Association told the Times: 'Mr Ratcliffe bough a beach house, a small cheaply built occasional dwelling. He wants to erect a mansion in its place.' Mr Baker claimed the planned jacking system is not sufficiently unique to allow planners to grant the house permission. However, neighbour Frank Woodward, 89, who lives 100 metres away from the beach house said: 'This area was flooded a few years ago so I think it's a good idea. There used to be a much bigger house on that site. 'Mr Ratcliffe has got the money. He has to have a big house. People who are objecting have only been living here for five minutes.'",

Mohammed Dahbi discriminated against actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer after ordering them to 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He warned that if they ignored his request during the trip on September 18, 2011, he would throw them out. Outraged: Mohammed Dahbi was accused of discrimination after ordering actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer to stop kissing and 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He was ordered to pay the couple $10,000 in fines . When they got out, Dahbi also called the pair 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away. He claimed during the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings\u00a0they were 'touching each other all over' and 'kissing heavily' . But according to DNAinfo New York, Judge John Spooner disagreed and ordered him to pay the fine. He also made him attend anti-discrimination training and pay a $5,000 civil penalty to the city. Ms Spitzer told the news website: 'We felt that what happened to us was wrong and he needed to take responsibility for his actions. The trip began at Columbus Circle when Ms Spizter climbed into the yellow cab with her dog and headed to pick Ms Thronton up in Chelsea, before heading to Sunset Park in Brooklyn. However, when they hit the Meatpacking District, Dahbi turned around and barked the orders at them. Verbal abuse: When the pair (pictured) got out, Dahbi also called them 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away . They said he was discriminating against them because they were gay, to which he replied: 'Don't make me out to be an a**hole.' They insist it was just a peck on the lips. Spizter told DNAinfo she knew this because she had just been to the dentist. She said: 'That\u2019s why I\u2019m so aware of what my behavior was in the taxi.' Dahbi's lawyer, Ali Najmi said he had never mentioned anything about the pair's sexuality and has a 'standard of decency'. They are now planning to appeal the decision. In a statement on his firm's website, he said: 'We will be pursuing an appeal of this decision. The Administrative Judge acted unreasonably and made conclusions of fact that cannot be substantiated based on the record. The fine amount is completely unfair given that there was no real injury here.'",

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

Madison County prosecutors filed paperwork in Circuit Court charging Geraldine Jones, 36, with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement\u00a0in the death of  Samantha Fleming, 23, of Anderson. Police Sgt Chad Boynton said Monday afternoon police had not yet been in contact with Jones, of Gary, who police say is being treated in Texas for depression. Scroll down for video . Geraldine Jones, 36, of Gary, Indiana, was charged with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement . Samantha Fleming and her three-week old baby went missing from her home in Anderson, Indiana, on April 5 . Police believe Fleming, 23, was lured from her home by Jones and the new mother brought Serenity with her . Authorities in Texas have taken precautions to make sure Jones can't leave the hospital and Indiana police are hoping to begin extradition proceedings, Fox 59 reported. Sgt Boynton said:\u00a0'We are making preparations to initiate conversation just as soon as possible.' Fleming was living with her boyfriend, but disappeared with her three-week-old baby Serenity on April 5. Police investigating Fleming's disappearance on Friday found her body in Jones' home in Gary, about 165 miles northwest of Anderson. She had been stabbed, wrapped in plastic and soaked with bleach. When police arrived, Fleming's daughter was being held by Jones' sister, who told police she had been caring for her sister's child while her sister was in Texas. Police determined the child was Fleming's and the baby was returned to relatives in Indianapolis. Authorities say they believe Jones got Fleming to travel to northwest Indiana by telling her she worked for the Indiana Department of Child Services and she needed to attend a hearing. Serenity was being held by Jones' sister, who told police she had been caring for her sister's young child . A woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared saying she was with DCS and wanted information . Indiana State Personnel Department spokeswoman Ashley Emsweller Hungate said no one named Geraldine Jones or with the name of her sister has ever worked for DCS. Police believe Jones may have faked being pregnant, telling family she was expecting twins. Boynton said police don't know how the woman was able to convince Fleming she worked for DCS, but he said Fleming did have previous contact with DCS. He said: 'So therefore the ploy that the suspect used to get her to leave Anderson and head to Lake County may have been more believable in her mind.' Police say a woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared and said she was with DCS and was seeking information about Fleming and her daughter. The body of Fleming was found stabbed, doused in bleach and wrapped in plastic inside this home in Gary . Authorities said the woman provided legitimate names of DCS employees and implied she was familiar with Fleming's case history. DCS spokesman James Wide said he couldn't comment on whether Fleming had a DCS case because of privacy laws. Wide said DCS is leaving the investigation into how the woman may have tricked Fleming into thinking she worked for DCS up to police. 'There's nothing internally being initiated from it, but we definitely will comply with law enforcement and help them where we can,' he said.",

Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley . Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track . For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track . Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''",

The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to \u00a330,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as\u00a0The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down.

High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 . St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now . Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was\u00a0destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940.\u00a0Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed . Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol.\u00a0The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s . Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again . Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone . Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol. It is believed the set of pictures could fetch up to \u00a330,000 when they go up for auction tomorrow . This photo shows Host Street in Bristol.

Thor Dalhaug died an hour after birth following a difficult delivery during which he suffered fatal brain damage due to a doctor\u2019s errors, ruled Stuart Fisher, senior coroner for Central Lincolnshire. In a damning report, he said an unsupervised junior surgeon tried to deliver the baby using forceps in an \u2018unorthodox and unacceptable\u2019 way. The coroner also concluded that senior managers at Lincoln County Hospital had tried to remove the fact that forceps had been used from an account of the birth. Doctors at the Lincoln County Hospital covered up a series of horrendous mistakes that led to the death of a twin baby boy (pictured above with his mother Michelle), a coroner has ruled . The report will come as a blow to the hospital, which has just been taken out of \u2018special measures\u2019. United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust was put on a turnaround regime almost two years ago because of concerns over high death rates. It is meant to have made a host of improvements. But Thor\u2019s parents said the report revealed that staff had behaved \u2018appallingly\u2019 over their son\u2019s death in September 2013. Rolf and Michelle Dalhaug were delighted when they found out they were expecting twins after seven years of trying for a baby. She was taken for a caesarean as doctors found Thor was distressed. But after the baby\u2019s head became stuck, junior surgeon Dr Deniz Al-Hirmizy tried to free him with her hands, before resorting to forceps. The baby was born alive but limp. Doctors resuscitated him but he died an hour later. Mr Fisher ruled that Thor died of brain damage as a result of attempts to free the baby\u2019s head. He also wrote that the \u2018use of forceps in these circumstances was unorthodox and unacceptable\u2019. While Dr Al-Hirmizy stated she had \u2018experience of caesareans\u2019, she claimed she had been \u2018unsupervised\u2019, wrote Mr Fisher. Surgeons \u2018neglected to make a full note of the circumstances\u2019, he found. \u2018In particular\u2019, he wrote, a doctor \u2018was advised to amend the caesarean pro forma, to include the fact that forceps were used\u2019. But this doctor was \u2018dissuaded from doing so by senior management as a result of concerns as to how this would be perceived\u2019. Mr Fisher ruled that Thor died of brain damage as a result of attempts to free the baby\u2019s head during delivery at the hospital (above) Mr Dalhaug, 39, said: \u2018The Trust have acted appallingly, causing our family great hardship. We accept that accidents can, do and will happen. What we do not accept is their failure to be honest, their failure to learn and their failure to act.\u2019 Dr Suneil Kapadia, the Trust\u2019s medical director, apologised to the Dalhaug family and said it would pay them compensation. He went on to say that the Care Quality Commission had recently rated the hospital\u2019s maternity services as good. But Suzanne White, a partner at law firm Leigh Day, said the family was looking at bringing a private prosecution. She added: \u2018Despite representing families at inquests for over 15 years, I am astonished by the circumstances surrounding baby Thor\u2019s tragic death.\u2019",

Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat\u2019s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning \u2018strange wing\u2019, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Su\u00e1rez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world\u2019s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning \"strange wing\" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don\u2019t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how \u00a0the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: \u2018As for gliding, if Yi qi\u2019s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. \u2018But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body \u2014 if the bulk of the animal\u2019s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. \u2018That is clearly the case in the authors\u2019 reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. \u2018Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. \u2018And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.\u2019",

But they do leave their trash. Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. \"Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,\" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. \"We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,\" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. \"There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip.\" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing \"in an eco-sensitive manner,\" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.",

When Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on TV today to insist none of the country\u2019s troops are positioned in the Ukraine, he looked decidedly fresh-faced for a man accused of war-mongering. The wrinkles on the 62-year-old's forehead, clearly visibly in previous pictures, have disappeared, while his skin look smooth, taut, tanned and younger than ever. Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has had cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes, wrinkles and make his face more chiseled . His appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 (left) and 2010 (right). In both photographs the skin of Putin's face is more saggy, and he has visible dark circles under his eyes . And as this series of pictures show, the Russian president's face has changed dramatically over the years \u2013 amid persistent rumours he has undergone cosmetic surgery to give himself a more youthful look. A black and white picture taken in 1991 when he was 37 years old shows him looking gaunt, and black bags under his eyes are clearly visible. Putin, pictured in 1985 (left) with his wife Lyudmila and daughter Katya, and in 1991 (right) when he was chairman of the External Relations Committee of Saint Petersburg, aged 37. His hair was already receding . Pictures taken in 2000 (left) and 2001 (right), when Putin was in his forties, also show 'crow's-feet' on his eyes . During his first term at President in 2007 Putin, then aged 55, looked his age while still healthy . In a photo dated 2000, Putin\u2019s hair still has tones of blonde but the signs of ageing are becoming more apparent on his features. Fast-forward to 2010, and the 'action man', now 57, looks tired and haggared after taking part in a judo session . Questions over whether Putin had gone under the knife came to the fore in 2011, when the then-Prime Minister was photographed with a yellow bruise on his face. Russian media began to question whether Putin had had plastic surgery in 2011. Pictured here announcing his intentions to run to become the President of Russia, journalists wondered if that bid sparked the surgery . Putin's face was puffy but relatively wrinkle-free in December 2013 when he attended a conference in Moscow . Plastic surgeons at the time told MailOnline that Botox injections, a facelift, cheek-fillers, a brow lift and removal of the bags under his eyes would have helped improve his ageing features \u2013 although his spokesman denied at the time he had had any work done. But In the same year he announced he wanted to become the next President of Russia, leading commentators to ask if that was the reason behind his new look. In December 2013, after around two years in office as President, he looked vastly different again, his face puffy but wrinkle-free. And in March this year, the Kremlin was forced to deny rumours that he was unwell \u2013 or had undergone surgery \u2013 when the President disappeared for 10 days, cancelling a string of appointments and public appearances. Questions were raised about Putin's health when he met with the President of Kyrgystan last month after a 10 day disappearance. He refused to explain where he had been saying 'it would be boring without gossip' Putin, pictured on April 16 2014 - looking relaxed and youthful as he give a television interview about Ukraine . When he emerged to meet with the President of Kyrgystan\u00a0his face was puffy and shiny, and eyes only able to partially open, leading journalists to wonder about the cause of his new look. However Putin has remained tight-lipped about his absence, laughing off the suggestions of poor health - or rumours that he had been attending the birth of a love child - saying; 'It would be boring without gossip.' His latest appearance is unlikely to quell suggestions that Putin has been knocking on the doors of plastic surgeons. Putin was recently reported as saying he won't be in office past the year 2024, when he will turns 71 years old - although these pictures suggest there is a good chance he won't look it.",

And the current owner, businesswoman Sharon Constancon, is related to the Leon family who once owned Bletchley Park. 'I only discovered this when I went on a visit to Bletchley Park with my uncle,' says Sharon. 'The Leon family donated the building to the Government in 1937 for use as a code-breaking centre.' While both are in Buckinghamshire, Cournswood House is in the south of the county \u2013 in ten acres of secluded woodlands in the picturesque village of North Dean \u2013 while Bletchley Park is in the town of Bletchley in the north, 20 miles away. During the Second World War at Bletchley Park, Dillwyn Knox led the team that made the first breaks into the code Germany was using, and he encouraged Alan Turing \u2013 the subject of The Imitation Game \u2013 in his work there. Although Knox does not feature in the new movie, he was portrayed by actor Richard Johnson in the 1996 television film Breaking The Code, which starred Derek Jacobi as Turing and Prunella Scales as his wife Sara. The pool is in a glasshouse, where vines thrive in the heated environment.\u00a0A separate glasshouse houses the Jacuzzi and a herb garden . Cracking mysteries seems to be something Knox enjoyed in his private life too, as novelist Agatha Christie was a good friend and often visited Cournswood. 'I fell in love with Cournswood House the moment I saw it,' says Sharon, who bought it in 2003. 'It's an outstanding property with lots of potential.' Apart from the main house, there are two cottages, offices, a swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym, and woodland with lakes, Japanese-style bridges, waterfalls and fountains. The pool is in a glasshouse, where vines thrive in the heated environment. 'The grapes are perfect for making chutney,' says Sharon. A separate glasshouse houses the Jacuzzi and a herb garden. Price: \u00a34million . Location: North Dean, Buckinghamshire . Bedrooms: 5 . Unique features: Office suite, indoor swimming pool, two cottages, Jacuzzi, gym, grass tennis court, former home of wartime codebreaker Dillwyn Knox . There are five bedrooms, four bathrooms (two en suite) and five reception rooms. The large drawing room has high ceilings, ornate cornicing and a fireplace with carved wooden mantel and surround. Double doors open on to a triple-tiered terrace, with an open barbecue, that overlooks the lakes and woodlands. In the dining room, solid parquet flooring continues through to the serving room, reached through a pair of oak double doors. The modern kitchen is a chef's delight, with Gaggenau and Miele ovens. In the centre is an island incorporating a breakfast bar and storage units. 'I love entertaining and the kitchen offers everything you could possibly want,' says Sharon. The reception hall features a sweeping staircase to the first floor, where there are the bedrooms and bathrooms as well as two dressing rooms and a TV/cinema room. The master bedroom opens on to a circular balcony with stunning views over the gardens, lakes and woods. In the library, still concealed behind one of the wall panels, is Knox's private safe. One of the property's cottages overlooks the lakes, while the other is on the edge of the woods. 'Both cottages are ideal for short- or long-term lets or for staff, friends or family visits,' says Sharon. At the entrance to the property there are electric gates with majestic stone golden eagles perched on top of pillars. 'I'm moving to downsize,' says Sharon. 'I'll miss the privacy, security and tranquillity, not to mention the wildlife, such as deer, red kites and ducks.' hamptons-int.com, 01494 611313 .",

A married father-of-two is set to leave his home in Devon to fight against ISIS in Iraq because jihadis 'need to be put down like rabid dogs'. Steven Christopher Costa, 31, plans to head out to the Middle East next month to join the war against the terrorists, leaving his wife and young children behind. Mr Costa, who spent six years in the Navy, will make the 4,000-mile trip after raising the cash to pay for flights. He said: 'When you have a rabid dog, you take it to the vet and put it down. 'Lots of people have said it's an admirable thing I am doing. I think it's a necessary thing.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists. The former seaman was recruited through the Foreign Fighters Against ISIS Facebook group, who help ex-military personnel make the journey to ISIS-controlled territory. He has applied for a visa and plans to fly to northern Iraq via Jordan. Mr Costa said he will take his own life if he is ever captured by the terrorists because he does not want his children to see him being executed in a Jihadi John-style video. 'I will be saving a bullet or keeping a grenade strapped to my chest,' he said. 'If I get captured, I will pull the pin and take my life so there will be nothing for them to parade in any propaganda videos. 'I won't be burnt alive and I certainly won't be beheaded. I don't want my kids to see that in 10 years' time on the internet, because it will still be there. 'I am not going to lie, I am frightened. And anyone who says they are not is lying.' When he arrives in Iraq, Mr Costa will join up with Kurdish fighters and other foreign ex-servicemen who have joined the battle against the barbaric Islamists (file picture) Previous attempts by people to go out to fight ISIS have led to them being arrested for terror offences, but Mr Costa says this will not happen to him. He said: 'I'm going to join the Kurdish Peshmerga - not a terror group - who some European countries are funding and sending weapons to. 'There are a few groups of former soldiers out there so I'll be fine. I'm going as a volunteer, not a mercenary, so I don't think I'll be stopped. I'm not being paid.' The former military man added:\u00a0'Not seeing my kids is my biggest fear before death. 'People are going to have to give their lives to stop ISIS and if one of them has to be me, then so be it. Mr Costa (pictured) will leave his wife and children behind to fight against ISIS for three months . 'I am not doing it for any monetary gain and I am not doing it for fame. 'My wife was not impressed when I told her, but she understands. 'The war that's happening over there will happen over here. It's just a matter of how long it will be before it comes here.' Steven said he aims to fight against the extremists for three months before returning to his family. 'If I have committed to something, I have to see it through,' he said. Otherwise it would bug me for the rest of my life.' Terror police warned Mr Costa against the trip but do not have the power to stop him leaving unless they suspect of him of carrying out an offence. Detective Sergeant Martin Lakey from the South West Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit, said: 'Whilst it is not illegal to travel to countries such as Syria and Iraq, if your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on return to the UK. 'Where there is a creditable likelihood of any British national travelling to high-risk area including Syria and Iraq, we will try to work with that person to ensure that they are fully aware of the risks, including highlighting the threat of kidnapping, and the effect of their travelling to fight could have on friends and family back in the UK. 'Our security advice is always in line with guidance given out by the Home Office in relation to foreign travel advice to high-risk areas.' Sir Edward Garnier QC, the former Solicitor General, warned last year that Britons who fight against terrorists in the Middle East would be interviewed by the police on their return. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are in a terrible grey area, not least because we don\u2019t know enough about what they are doing. 'The United Kingdom is trying to defeat Isil. But freelancers are not acting on behalf of the United Kingdom. They may well be guilty of murder, or other sorts of crimes, or they might not be guilty of anything. 'It goes to the general story who go abroad to fight in other people\u2019s wars place themselves not only in physical danger, but in that legal limbo land where they could, if they get on the wrong side of this almost invisible line, into trouble when they get home.'",

Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I\u2019ve ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette \u2013 silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys \u2013 it\u2019s what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour',\u00a0come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don\u2019t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot\u2019s Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room \u2013 say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to\u00a0communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you\u2019ll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You\u2019ll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo \u2013 all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery \u2013 you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don\u2019t neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you\u2019ve made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

Messi, the top scorer in La Liga, did not feature in either of Argentina's friendlies during the international break after sustaining a blow to his right foot in last month's 'Clasico' against Real Madrid. 'I am optimistic about Messi, I have spoken to him,' Pique told reporters at a promotional event. Lionel Messi (right) should be available for Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo, according to Gerard Pique . 'I think that he can play at Balaidos (Celta's stadium),' added the Spain international, who came through Barca's youth academy with Messi. 'In the end it is up to how he feels during the rest of the week. The medical staff are those who should decide. My feeling is that he will play.' Barca's 2-1 win at home to Real stretched their lead over their arch rivals at the top of La Liga to four points with 10 games left. Second-placed Real, who host Granada on Sunday, have stuttered in recent weeks and the 2-1 defeat at the Nou Camp was their third loss in their last four outings in all competitions. Messi (left) is slightly doubtful after suffering a foot injury in Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Madrid last month . Barca, by contrast, are on a seven-match winning run and in with a chance of repeating 2009's unprecedented treble of Champions League and Spanish league and Cup after failing to secure major silverware last term for the first time in six years. They play Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition and are through to May's King's Cup final against Athletic Bilbao. 'We know it is going to be very hard and we will have to be at a high level if we want to win the titles,' Pique said. 'We have the team and we have demonstrated an improvement over the past year, the level has been rising and has given us a lot of confidence.'

Grown-up children who are still in their family home are living the \u2018life of Riley\u2019 while unknowingly pushing their parents into debt, research shows. The so-called \u2018boomerang generation\u2019 are placing their parents under serious financial pressure by living at home even in their twenties and thirties. Now, debt organisations have warned that parents should not be afraid to ask their children for rent and money towards household bills amid fears the British \u2018stiff upper lip\u2019 makes them reluctant to admit when they need help. Experts claim grown-up children still living at home are often completely unaware that they are forcing their parents further into debt. Research revealed that as many as three-quarters of parents whose children are over 18 still have at least one child living with them. But only 42 per cent charge their children rent \u2013 with many admitting they feel too guilty and uncomfortable to ask. And even if they manage to ask their offspring to contribute, most charge them just \u00a3150 a month, compared with a typical UK rent of \u00a3750. On top of this, 80 per cent still buy their adult child\u2019s groceries, and 60 per cent cook dinner for them each night, according to the study by website TopCashBack. Parents expressed concern that their children could not afford to move out or were struggling to save for a house deposit. But the survey found the average salary of a grown-up child living at home is \u00a326,000, giving them a comfortable \u00a31,000 in disposable income each month. Half of parents who did charge rent admitted they relied on that money to cover living expenses such as groceries and utility bills. Food for thought: Eight out of ten parents survey said they still bought their children's groceries for them . In fact, a second study released today revealed that many debt-ridden parents are falling into deeper financial trouble because of their stay-at-home children. According to debt management specialist PayPlan, a third of parents in debt who have grown-up children living at home have been forced to take out a loan to meet the costs of housing and feeding them. Young adults brought up on the internet are beset by loneliness because they make friends online rather than face to face, a survey reveals. It found many of the so-called Facebook generation of internet-obsessed people in their late teens, twenties and early thirties say they feel lonely. One in seven of those who find it hard to make friends are too scared to talk to strangers. Their fear of relationships appears linked to how they usually communicate \u2013 by text, Facebook and email. But unlike older generations they seem to have no time or inclination to talk to their neighbours. The survey of nearly 2,500 people by The Big Lunch community campaign undermines the idea that loneliness mostly affects the elderly. Dr Rebecca Harris of the University of Bolton, who worked on the poll, said: \u2018Our brains treat loneliness the same as physical pain. We\u2019re spending less time having social interaction, we have fewer friends than we\u2019d like and we\u2019re finding it harder to make new friends.\u2019 But half of these parents say they still refuse to ask their kids to contribute to the household pot. Jane Clack, of PayPlan, said: \u2018In this country we are renowned for a stiff upper lip, but the truth is that many parents are under emotional strain as a result of their debts.\u2019",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe Hunger Games film franchise has grossed over $2 billion after three movies - and the final chapter is due out at the end of the year. Before that, the Twilight saga managed $3.3 billion over five films from 2008. The Avengers garnered $1.5 billion with just one film in 2012, and there are three other sequels to come, with the follow-up hitting cinemas May 1. When it comes to Hollywood's primary concern - banking a major box office - a series or superhero adaptation is largely seen as a surefire success, in a benchmark set in the early 2000's by Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings, and followed by The Pirates Of The Caribbean and Spiderman. However, while original screenplays and independent projects are being edged out and overlooked as a result, there is still a small group of stars considered capable of pulling people into theaters in droves. According to a new survey in\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter - which called upon producers, agents and executives to list those who can command a major opening based on their fan base - \u00a0there are six superstars around that can keep the studios swelling, without having to resort to turning a best-selling book or beloved comic into a picture. In return, they can ask for $20 million per film. 1. Sandra Bullock . The acting favorite, who won an Oscar in 2010 for The Blind Side, topped Forbes' list of the highest-earning actresses in 2014. The Miss Congeniality star took the headline spot thanks to her gripping turn in Gravity, which became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2013, with a global box office of $716 million. And while her buddy cop comedy The Heat with Melissa McCarthy managed similarly impressive numbers, with about $229.9 million worldwide, the powerful pull that Bullock has today is a career-long achievement. Thrillers like Speed, A Time To Kill ,Murder By Numbers and Crash served her well, but Bullock's legion of loyal fans have really followed her quality comedies and dramas - from While You Were Sleeping to Hope Floats, Practical Magic, 28 Days, Two Weeks Notice and The Proposal. Theater favorite: Sandra Bullock has built up an impressive and loyal following over a career spanning almost 30 years. Here she is pictured in 2013's Gravity (left) and Speed in in 1994 (right) Old faithful: Bullock made her name - and continues to - by appearing in feel-good romantic comedies, such as Hope Floats with Harry Connick Jr. in 1998. In it Bullock plays a housewife who moves back to the small town she is from following the collapse of her marriage . 2. Leonardo DiCaprio . For a young guy who started out doing TV ads for Bubble Yum chewing gum in the 1990s, DiCaprio is now 40 and a bona fide movie star. While 1997's Titanic is still ranked as the second highest-grossing film of all time (after Avatar), taking $2.18 billion, he has appeared in some of the largest films of the last 15 years, including Inception, Django Unchained, The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, The Aviator and, most recently, The Wolf Of Wall St. According to The Richest, his films have grossed an astounding $2.3 billion. Mr blockbuster: Leonardo DiCaprio asked for $25 million up front to appear as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf Of Wall Street (left), according to reports. His is pictured out and about in New York in September 2014 (right) 3. Matt Damon . He is perhaps best-known for the Bourne spy series, which spawned three films from 2002. And, despite a shaky return once the series wrapped up, with the disappointing performances of The Adjustment Bureau, Margaret, Invictus, Green Zone, We Bought a Zoo and Promised Land, Damon showed once more he is a leading man when not playing Jason Bourne. End-of-the-world blockbuster Elysium became a big movie for Sony in 2013, not just for its global takings of $286 million, but for being an original screenplay - a follow-up to Neill Blomkamp's sleeper hit District 9 - and not an adaptation. However the big money will come in 2016, when he reprises his role as Bourne. Leading man: Matt Damon - pictured left with his wife Luciana Barroso - made a big comeback in 2013 with sci-fi hit Elysium (right) 4. Robert Downey Jr. This comeback king put a shocking bout of arrests, rehab and prison behind him when he played unconventional superhero Tony Stark in 2008's Iron Man. He followed it up in 2009 by appearing as the title role in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, and then its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows, in 2011. Iron Man 2 proved another major hit in 2010, and then the character appeared in The Avengers in 2012, before Iron Man 3 broke office records in 2013, collecting $1.2 billion. Downey Jr. now has an estimated net worth of $190 million, and is said to be on the best pay packet of all the actors who are signed on to The Avenger's. Comeback king: Robert Downey Jr. has played Iron Man in three installments, plus The Avengers franchise, all of which has a big pay pack . 5. Angelina Jolie . She won an Oscar for playing a disturbingly violent inmate of a female mental institution in 1999's Girl, Interrupted, before going to refashion herself as a leading action star, with roles in Gone In 60 Seconds, Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith, The Wanted and Salt. While her most recent film, Unbroken, featured her as director, the Disney live-action flick Maleficent became the fourth highest-grossing film of 2014, taking $758 million. The actress was paid a reported $15 million for the Sleeping Beauty remake, and is set to make $20 million for the Salt sequel. Regardless of the film, if Jolie is in it, audiences will go see it. Action star: While last year's Maleficent was a big box office hit, Jolie is expected to collect $20 for the Salt sequel . 6. Denzel Washington . Two-time Academy Award nominee Denzel Washington has a career that is as diverse as it is spread out. From Muslim minister and human rights activist Malcolm X in 1992, to boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter The Hurricane and football coach Herman Boone in Remember the Titans, he moved into a series of action roles, including Training Day, Man On Fire and American Gangster. But his portrayed of an alcoholic but brilliant commerical pilot who prevents a catastrophic plane crash in Flight is the most memorable of late. Washington is believed to have been paid $20 million - $10 million more than co-star Mark Wahlberg - for the 2013 film 2 Guns. According to The Hollywood Reporter survey, however, there is a separate list of actors who are not far behind this list. The second group are said to be able to command $15 million each per picture. In order, that list goes\u00a0Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence, Melissa McCarthy and Channing Tatum. The $15 million club: The recent survey said these six are Hollywood's next-in-line for huge pay packets.\u00a0In order, that list goes Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence, Melissa McCarthy and Channing Tatum .",

A team led by Imperial College London has already applied to patent the therapy, which they say could be ready for human trials within three years. The scientists discovered a protein which helps boost the body\u2019s immune system ten-fold, an astonishing effect which could help patients fight off cancers and viruses. The protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic T-cells, which have the ability to detect cancerous cells, hunt them down, and destroy them . The protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic T-cells, which have the ability to detect cancerous cells, hunt them down, and destroy them. In a chance discovery in mice, it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or LEM - dramatically boosted the body\u2019s number of T-cells. They are now developing a gene therapy that would boost the production of LEM proteins, in turn increasing the number of T-cells available to attack cancer cells. The therapy, revealed in the international journal Science last night, would use the existing T-cells taken from individual patients. The patient\u2019s cells would be removed, modified with the insertion of LEM-producing genes, and then infused back into the patients via a drip, probably on four occasions over two months. It might also be used to treat other viruses, they said. The development, which also involved researchers from Queen Mary University of London, ETH Zurich in Switzerland and Harvard Medical School in the US, has already been six years in the making. Cytotoxic T-cells are an important component of the immune system, but when faced with serious infections or advanced cancer, they are usually unable to mobilise in large enough quantities to fight the disease. In a chance discovery in mice, it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or LEM - dramatically boosted the body\u2019s number of T-cells . By screening mice with genetic mutations, the Imperial team discovered a strain of mice that produced ten times as many cytotoxic T-cells when infected with a virus, compared with normal mice. The discovery was unexpected because the new protein had no known function and resembles no other protein known to science. But the mice suppressed infections more effectively and were far more resistant to cancer. They also produced more of a second type of T-cells, memory cells, enabling them to recognise infections they have encountered previously and launch a rapid response. In further experiments the scientists went on to show that the LEM molecule had a similar impact on the human immune system. A team led by Imperial College London (pictured) has already applied to patent the therapy, which they say could be ready for human trials within three years . Study leader Professor Philip Ashton-Rickardt of Imperial College, said: \u2018Cancer cells have ways to suppress T-cell activity, helping them to escape the immune system. \u2018Genetically engineering T cells to augment their ability to fight cancer has been a goal for some time and techniques for modifying them already exist. \u2018By introducing an active version of the LEM gene into the T-cells of cancer patients, we hope we can provide a robust treatment for patients. \u2018Next we will test the therapy in mice, make sure it is safe and see if it can be combined with other therapies. The treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time, relying on an extraction of the patient\u2019s own cells . \u2018If all goes well, we hope to be ready to carry out human trials in about three years.\u2019 He said gene therapy would initially be used to treat patients with advanced cancer. The treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time, relying on an extraction of the patient\u2019s own cells. But he insisted the cost would be manageable, given the significant benefits it could bring. Imperial College has already filed two patents for the technology, and a spin-off company called ImmunarT has been formed with the aim of commercialising the therapy. Dr Mike Turner of the Wellcome Trust, which helped fund the research, said: \u2018The discovery of a protein that could boost the immune response to not only cancer, but also to viruses, is a fascinating one. \u2018Further investigation in animal models is needed before human trials can commence, but there is potential for a new type of treatment that capitalises on the immune system\u2019s innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells.\u2019",

But ahead of Wednesday night's quarter-final replay with Blackburn, Fowler has warned Gerrard's team-mates not to concentrate on providing the 34-year-old with a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (right) trains alongside Rickie Lambert at Melwood on Monday . Gerrard will miss Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final replay with Blackburn because of suspension . Reds legend Robbie Fowler, pictured with Kenny Dalglish, says Liverpool's players must not focus on Gerrard . Fowler told goal.com: 'Everyone would absolutely love Steven to win it, what with this being his last season and possibly last game, and hopefully that will be the case. 'But Liverpool have got to get themselves into the position where they can't do this just for Steven Gerrard. They've got to do it for every individual involved with the club. That's the way it should be.' Gerrard will miss the trip to Ewood Park as he serves the second match of a three-game suspension and Fowler hopes that Jordan Henderson and Co put their missing captain to the back of their minds . 'If you put too much effort in for one man, maybe you can get a little bit too excited or overboard,' added Fowler. 'As much as it would be Steven's last game, they've got to get past that and just do it for themselves. 'In an ideal world, they'll do it, and no-one would love it more than me. Steven deserves to go out on a high but they've got to do it for themselves. It's not all about Steven.' Fowler has also urged Raheem Sterling to end his contract wrangle and commit his future to the club after he rejected a new deal worth \u00a3100,000-a-week. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has rejected a new \u00a3100,000-a-week deal to stay at Anfield . Fowler believes Sterling, pictured training on Monday, should stay at Liverpool to develop his game . Writing in his column for the Daily Mirror, Fowler said: 'I think it\u2019s nonsense to suggest Sterling will have to go elsewhere to win trophies and fulfil all these dreams he\u2019s apparently got. 'In the space of two seasons, with a very, very young team that will only get better, they should have won the league, should have beaten Chelsea in a semi to get to Wembley... and should play in an FA Cup Final there in May. 'I was brought up at Anfield and still work there, so what else am I going to think?, but he\u2019d be crazy to go at this stage in his development, especially because he\u2019s being guided by a special manager who has already turned Luis Suarez into one of the best players in the world... and earned Luis the money to go with that status.'",

Ahead of the blockbuster clash at Stamford Bridge, the United squad were pictured travelling down to London on Friday afternoon. Led by captain Wayne Rooney the Red Devils' contingent commuted via Stockport Railway Station to the English capital. Wayne Rooney (left) and Ashley Young were among the Manchester United stars who made the trip to London via train on Friday ahead of this weekend's Premier League clash at Chelsea . Radamel Falcao (left) or Robin van Persie (right) could start up front for United vs Chelsea on Saturday . United boss Louis van Gaal  faces a number of selection dilemmas ahead of their clash against the Blues . It was earlier revealed that the 29-year-old striker may have to revert to a midfield role against the Blues after Michael Carrick and Daley Blind were two of four  United players ruled out of the clash due to injury. However, Van Gaal is able to call upon the services of in-form midfielder Juan Mata who is returning to the home of his former club for the first time on Saturday. Mata, who won three trophies in two-and-a-half successful seasons at the Bridge, posted a picture via his Instagram account as the United players boarded the train on Friday afternoon. Accompanied with the caption: 'I got back to London a few times, but this one it's different... Big game, lots of memories, great day of football!... #CFC vs #MUFC' United's No 8 was all smiles as he gears up for what promises to be emotional return to west London. Alongside the injuries of Carrick and Blind, United duo Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were also absent from the train ride - with the quartet all suffering injuries following United's 4-2 win over bitter rivals Manchester City on April 12. The club's injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho\u2019s side. And the latter was all smiles alongside Victor Valdes as they travelled down to London on Friday. Falcao is one of several selection dilemmas that Van Gaal and assistant boss Ryan Giggs have to make for the trip against Chelsea; in what the Dutchman described  as \u2018the worst scenario\u2019. Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after .

Rooney (right) has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back into midfield . Van Gaal (left) puts his arm round Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney during training this week . Van Gaal (left) has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . \u2018I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that\u2019s not so good for us,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it\u2019s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones,' the 63-year-old said at United's pre-match press conference on Friday. \u2018That\u2019s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don\u2019t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don\u2019t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. \u2018Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s not special in the life of a manager or a team. \u2018You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. \u2018It\u2019s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. \u2018Other players can take profit of the moment now. It\u2019s always like that. It\u2019s not special in the life of a manager or a team.\u2019 Van Gaal addresses the media ahead of Man United's crucial Premier League clash with Chelsea on Saturday .

Fellaini (centre right) is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Manchester City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: \u2018Maybe you shall see tomorrow [Saturday]. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don\u2019t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.\u2019 With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. \u2018It\u2019s still possible, I\u2019ve said that before,\u2019 he added. \u2018It is not logical but it is possible. It\u2019s more when and if, and I don\u2019t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. \u2018But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea\u2019s shoulders. You never know, you\u2019ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. \u2018They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . \u2018We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That\u2019s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. \u2018To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I\u2019m still a manager because I don\u2019t have to work anymore \u2013 you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.\u2019 Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend\u2019s work ethic. He said: \u2018It\u2019s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that\u2019s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. \u2018But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he\u2019s learning quickly.\u2019 Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford .",

Caught on camera: On viewing the CCTV security cameras, the store manager said he saw one of the detectives finding the rent money box under the counter, and Detective Ian Cyrus grabbing a handful of it . Mr Abdullah said Detective Ian Cyrus then bends down and when he stands up, he appears to put the money in his coat pocket . Five New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives went to the Brooklyn store on Friday April 3 and arrested two employees accused of selling untaxed cigarettes, according to\u00a0ABC7 Eyewitness News. Officers reportedly took money from the cash register and packs of cigarettes as evidence. Manager Ali Abdullah, who was not in the shop at the time, was given a receipt from the police the following day saying $593 had been seized, but he realised $2,650 in store rent money was missing. On viewing the CCTV security cameras, he said Detective Cyrus grabbed a handful of cash from the rent money box under the counter. Mr Abdullah said the detective then bends down and when he stands up, he appears to put the money in his coat pocket. 'I look at my system, I see the officer took the money,' Mr Abdullah told the news channel. 'It's crazy.' He said he called a nearby police department, who sent a supervisor to look at the video. Mr Abdullah claims the supervisor said: 'He's going to lose his pension, lose his life, for $2,600?' NYPD Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis told MailOnline: 'Based on the nature of the allegations in this incident, in addition to the video provided to us, the NYPD has placed one detective on suspension and one supervisor on modified assignment status pending further investigation into the matter. 'Detective Ian Cyrus 49, assigned to Brooklyn North Narcotics has been suspended. Sergeant Fritz Glemaud 44, assigned to Brooklyn North Narcotics has been placed on modified assignment.'

Alice is the name of the Queen's aunt, who passed away in 2004 aged 102, while Charlotte is favoured as a nod to William's father Charles. According to the newspaper, if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James, with the second favourite name being Alexander. Many people are hoping for a girl though - of the 2,200 people polled, a quarter said they wanted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to have a female baby, with only three percent hoping for a younger brother for George.

Needing to win to keep the title race alive - at least mathematically - for another week, Wolfsburg rarely looked like succeeding as they were second best at the Borussia Park Stadion. They resisted until the last minute of the game, though, when Max Kruse struck to earn the Foals a win which moves them up to third and secures their place in the Champions League next season. Max Kruse (centre) celebrates his last-minute winner against Wolfsburg on Sunday in the Bundesliga .

But the defeat means Bayern Munich have been crowned Bundesliga champions for the 25th time .

Bayern have secured the title with four matches to spare. However, the Champions League semi-finalists will have to wait to celebrate it with their fans as they travel to Bayer Leverkusen next week before hosting Augsburg on May 9th. 'Retaining the title is a magnificent achievement. All credit to the coach and the team,' Bayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on the club's website.

But the timing was right for the gang of British comedians (along with their token American, Terry Gilliam), who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" their groundbreaking British TV series. \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" which premiered 40 years ago Thursday, was the result. The movie, a spoof of the Arthurian legend, did not start auspiciously. The budget was small -- about $400,000, half of it supplied by rock stars, including Genesis and Pink Floyd. On the first day of filming in Scotland -- the first shot, in fact -- the camera broke. The weather was bad. The hotel was dismal. Python member Graham Chapman was suffering from alcohol withdrawal. It got better. On the day of its first American screening in New York, a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. Thanks to the popularity of \"Python\" on American TV, the movie was a box-office hit, making $5 million -- more than 10 times its budget. More importantly, it soon became a comedy classic. The dialogue alone has been widely quoted, with such lines as \"It's just a flesh wound\" and \"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries\" referenced on shows such as \"The Simpsons,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and \"The Blacklist.\"  Python member Eric Idle turned the film into the Tony-winning Broadway play \"Spamalot.\" The troupe ended up making three movies -- well, four, if you count \"And Now for Something Completely Different,\" five if you include \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,\" five-and-a-half if you allow \"The Rutles,\" six if you ... well, three. We'll say three. Is there a best one? Where should you start? Let's break them down: . From its dramatic opening credits featuring fake-Swedish subtitles to the adventures of Sir Launcelot (\"the boldest and most expensive of the knights\"), weighted-bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks, \"Holy Grail\" is probably the loosest and most Python-esque of the Python oeuvre. As a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense, it falls short -- but as a repository for some of Python's best gags, it remains perhaps the best (and certainly most quotable) of the bunch. Besides, it features the word \"shrubbery.\" \" 'Grail' is a bit like 'A Hard Day's Night,' \" Idle observed in the Pythons' autobiography. \"It's got a joie de vivre that's very infectious, it's very hard not to like.\" Pros: The dialogue. The Black Knight. The Knights Who Say \"Ni.\" Cons: It's sometimes sloppy. And it doesn't really have an ending. Verdict: Better than a cheese shop full of ex-parrots. Probably Python's most consistent movie, \"Life of Brian\" is the story of a guy born down the road from Jesus who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified. It was a satire on organized religion, first-century politics and zealotry -- one of the best bits is the ongoing argument between \"the People's Front of Judea\" and \"the Judean People's Front\" -- but try telling that to the protesters. The film was picketed in cities across the United States, deplored by some religious leaders and banned in Ireland and Norway. (Sweden promoted it with the line, \"The film so funny that it was banned in Norway.\") It did have one huge supporter: ex-Beatle George Harrison, who mortgaged his estate to help fund the movie when a financier pulled out. \"He paid for it because he wanted to see it,\" Idle recalled. \"The most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history.\" Pros: Graham Chapman's performance as Brian. \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Cons: The adventurous but ultimately pointless animated-alien scene. Michael Palin's lisping Pilate (though, to be fair, it's so childishly broad you can't help but laugh). Verdict: Funnier than the Spanish Inquisition. \"Meaning of Life,\" constructed as a series of sketches, is the most uneven of the three narrative Python films. After the stunning opening sequence, Gilliam's \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\" -- about the revenge of some pirate-like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing. Even the Pythons thought so. \"The rhythms weren't right,\" said Gilliam. \"It needed a whole other rewrite,\" said Idle. Nevertheless, it has its moments: the \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" sequence, about religion, sex and contraception; the organ donor who's surprised by a demand for his liver; and -- of course -- the infamous Mr. Creosote, the absurdly fat man who gorges on a monstrous meal at a posh restaurant, regurgitates it at length, and is then encouraged to have a \"wafer-thin\" after-dinner mint -- with disastrous results. It also has the sweetest of all Python songs: Idle's \"The Galaxy Song,\" which is even more uplifting than \"Brian's\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Not a bad conclusion, given what happened to Mr. Creosote. Pros: \"Permanent Assurance.\" Mr. Creosote. \"The Galaxy Song.\" Cons: The fish. The schoolmaster's sex lesson. The fish. Verdict: More enjoyable than watching the Upper-Class Twit of the Year competition.",

In a rare foreign policy speech, the Labour leader will pledge to \u2018restore our commitment\u2019 to the EU and other international groups such as the United Nations. Mr Miliband has all but ruled out a referendum on Europe, saying it is \u2018very unlikely\u2019 there will be a transfer of powers to the EU that would trigger one. Scroll down for video . In a rare foreign policy speech, Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured above) will today pledge to \u2018restore Britain's commitment\u2019 to the European Union and other international groups such as the United Nations . Today he will accuse David Cameron of \u2018taking Britain to the edge of European exit\u2019. And he will pledge to embrace the EU in a bid to secure reforms. \u2018We will be rebuild our influence, and that starts with the EU,\u2019 he will say. \u2018I want a clear message to be sent to our European partners that an incoming Labour government will be serious about leading once again in Europe and serious also about reforming Europe. \u2018Leaving Europe would be profoundly damaging to the lives of our people and the future of our country. We will never put the national interest at risk by threatening to leave.\u2019 His comments echo a controversial intervention this month by Tony Blair, who said Britain\u2019s membership of the EU was \u2018too important\u2019 to put to a public vote. Ukip's Nigel Farage . He was a foreigner thought to have been born in Turkey. But Ukip has insisted St George would be welcome in Britain today because of his skills as a dragon slayer. Yesterday on St George\u2019s Day, the party announced that it would make it a Bank Holiday in England. At the policy launch, economic spokesman Patrick O\u2019Flynn faced questions over whether England\u2019s patron saint would have been welcomed by Ukip. In its election manifesto the party has said it would have a five-year moratorium on unskilled migrants moving to the country. Mr O\u2019Flynn said: \u2018Well, I guess dragon-slaying is a skill but whether it is one that\u2019s in short supply for the needs of the British economy, we will leave to our migration commission.\u2019 The party said it wanted to end a \u2018cultural self-loathing\u2019 about being proud to be English. Nigel Farage yesterday celebrated St George\u2019s Day at a working men\u2019s club in Ramsgate, in the South Thanet constituency he is hoping to represent. Asked whether Ukip would have welcomed St George, Mr Farage said: \u2018I think there\u2019s room within our immigration policy for heroes.\u2019 Mr Miliband\u2019s decision to turn his back on a referendum has angered some senior Labour figures, who fear it leaves the party looking dangerously out of touch with public opinion. But he will claim today that Britain\u2019s hopes of achieving reform in Brussels have been weakened by Mr Cameron\u2019s pledge to hold an In/Out referendum by the end of 2017. \u2018This government\u2019s approach to Europe means that even when Britain\u2019s interests are shared by other member states, EU leaders are reluctant to support us because they think we already have one foot out of the door,\u2019 he will say. He will accuse the Prime Minister of backing a referendum because he is \u2018too weak\u2019 to take on his party\u2019s Right-wingers and his fear of Ukip. In an incendiary claim he will warn that Mr Cameron \u2018has presided over the biggest loss of influence for our country in a generation\u2019. Mr Miliband\u2019s claim to statesmanship will anger Tory high command, who point out he withdrew his support for strikes on Syria for its use of chemical weapons in 2013 under pressure from Left-wingers in his shadow cabinet. But the Labour leader will accuse the Tories of failing to learn the lessons of the Iraq War. He will also commit to putting climate change \u2018at the core of Labour\u2019s foreign policy\u2019, including pushing for costly targets to cut carbon emissions to zero. Former business secretary Lord Mandelson last night admitted voters were still spooked by the economic record of the last Labour government. He told Channel Four News: \u2018People like Labour\u2019s values and feel they are more in touch, but they have a problem about their record from the last government, and the last two years where people feel, fairly or not, that we allowed debt, borrowing and the deficit to run away from us.\u2019 Lord Mandelson also acknowledged there was \u2018quite of lot of fear\u2019 among business leaders about the prospect of a Labour government. But he insisted it was \u2018misplaced\u2019. Mr Miliband (pictured above) is accusing David Cameron of \u2018taking Britain to the edge of European exit\u2019 With only David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a position to be Prime Minister after the election, voters face a stark choice on immigration policy. Here, JAMES SLACK examines the key differences between the party manifestos. NET MIGRATION . Tories: Re-state commitment to cut net migration to the \u2018tens of thousands\u2019 from current level of 300,000. Make it harder for non-EU citizens to get marriage visas to enter the UK. Cap number of non \u2013EU work visas at 20,700. Labour: No upper limit on net migration. Last Labour government presided over a deliberate open door policy which saw the foreign-born population rocket by 3.6million. Ed Miliband has said sorry for the calamitous underestimate of the number of Eastern Europeans who arrived \u2013 but, crucially, he refuses to accept unprecedented levels of non-EU migration were a mistake. MIGRANTS FROM EU . Tories: No in-work benefits for four years. Benefits for jobseekers stopped. Residency requirement for social housing. Citizens of poor countries which join the EU denied free movement. Labour: Prevent migrants from claiming handouts for two years. Support open borders with the EU. Would block in/out referendum or attempt to curb free movement. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS . Tories: New system of \u2018deport first, appeal later\u2019 to dramatically increase number of removals. Fit electronic tags on foreign criminals so they can be monitored by satellite pending deportation. Scrap Human Rights Act. Labour: Ideologically-wedded to HRA. Vague promise to \u2018deport those who commit crimes while they are here\u2019. Last Labour government released 1,000 overseas convicts without even considering them for deportation. FOREIGN STUDENTS . Tories: Clamp down on satellite campuses opened in London by universities based elsewhere in UK. Since 2010 party has closed 850 of the bogus colleges which proliferated under Labour. Labour: No mention of bogus colleges. Under last Labour government, wholesale abuse saw number of student visas issued more than triple. The National Audit Office found that in the 2009 as many as 50,000 bogus students may have entered the UK to work rather than study.",

The shot, travelling at 45.1mph, was hit such power that the back-pedaling Courtois was unable to deflect the ball away despite getting his fingers to it.

Which do you think is the best long-range goal in Premier League history? Now share your opinion . Chelsea had been leading thanks to a penalty from Eden Hazard before Adam produced his moment of genius. The blues went on to win the match - but few will be talking about the result after witnessing a contender for best Premiership goal ever. Speaking after the game, Adam said: 'On a personal note it is a great goal to score. I saw the keeper off his line, had an effort and it has gone in. 'I always have a look at the goalkeeper because these balls move so much. When you have got that much space and time it is good to do something like that. 'It was great to get back into the game, but we lost it and that is three on the bounce and we need to come back against West Ham next week.' Adam later told the BBC: 'I never knew I had that much power, to beat a quality goalkeeper like that is something special. Once in a lifetime this can happen to you.' The strike is already being hailed as one of the greatest in the Premier League's history on social media and has been compared to other legendary long-range strikes from David Beckham and Xabi Alonso. Beckham famously scored from his own half against Wimbledon in 1996 - \u00a0a goal that catapulted him into the limelight. Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso, renowned for his long-range efforts, scored from 70 yards in 2006 while playing for Liverpool against Newcastle. Another of the Premier League's great long-range efforts came from a Stoke player when goalkeeper Asmir Begovic score from 91 yards in 2013. The strike has now been registered as the 'longest goal scored in football' in the latest edition of the famous book of records. It came just 12 seconds after kick-off - catching the wind and bouncing over opposite number Artur Boruc into the net. Floundering:\u00a0The shot was hit such power that the back-pedalling Courtois was unable to deflect the ball away despite getting his fingers to it . 66-yarder:\u00a0The goal is already being hailed as one of the best ever on social media and has been compared to other legendary long-range strikes from David Beckham and Xabi Alonso .

Charlie Adam's stunning 66-yard belter has caused a stir on social media and will no doubt be remembered as one of the finest Premier League goals ever. Here are some of the legendary long-range strikes the goal is being compared to: . David Beckham, Man Utd v Wimbledon 1996 . Beckham truly announced himself on the scene when he scored from just inside his own half against Wimbledon in 1996. After taking a pass from Brian McClair, Beckham hit it from the halfway line to leave keeper Neil Sullivan stranded. David Beckham scored from behind the half-way line in a Premier League match against Wimbledon in 1996 . Xabi Alonso, Liverpool v Newcastle 2006 .

Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship \u2013 equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes \u2013 was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship (back left) as it passes through the English Channel in February . Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over \u00a3390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just \u00a33.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels. A former second in command for the Norwegian military said: 'Russia is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business. It's clear, very few people know what happens on these vessels.' Jan Reksten believes the sale of Olavsvern was 'a double loss' as 'Norway's armed forces lost an important base and now there are Russian vessels docked there'.",

The prodigious pumpkins displayed at this year's show were cleverly recycled by being served to the Asian Elephants at the popular Sydney zoo. The prize-winning pumpkins - including a 728kg monster that was the biggest pumpkin to ever grace a Sydney Royal Easter Show - were presented to the elephants on Friday morning. Baby elephant Tukta feeds on a giant pumpkin from the\u00a0Sydney Royal Easter Show on Friday morning . Taronga's Asian Elephant herd, including 3300kg Pak Boon and calves Pathi Harn and Tukta, were quick to swoop on the record-breaking pumpkin. 'We're always looking for new foods and enrichment items to challenge and stimulate our extraordinary animals. The adult elephants were no strangers to pumpkins, but keepers were keen to see what they would make of the supersized variety. 'Elephants have many remarkable skills and environmental enrichment is a great way to encourage these skills and arouse their natural curiosity,' said Elephant Keeper, Steve Westnedge. The novelty sized pumpkins displayed at this year's show were served to the Asian Elephants at the popular Sydney zoo . Keepers introduce new foods and enrichment items to challenge and stimulate the extraudinary animals . Taronga's elephants are served a medley of different food items, particularly relishing fibrous palm logs and tough pineapple plant tops. They can eat between 60kg and 100kg in one day. 'When we saw the giant pumpkin in the news, we thought it was a fun opportunity to bring a taste of the Easter Show to Taronga and offer a nutritious and challenging treat to the Zoo's largest animals,' said Steve. The 728 monster, the work of grower Dale Oliver, was the largest pumpkin ever seen in Australasia . The record-holder had enjoyed pride of place at the Great Backyard Pumpkin Challenge in the Flower and Garden Pavilion at the Show, among 50,000 other pieces of fruit and vegetables. The pumpkins would normally be recycled as green waste after the show, but organisers were happy to see them served to some mammoth diners instead.

It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal . India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work. Nepal will need India's friendship -- as well as China's -- for many long months ahead.",

Thieves using heavy cutting equipment and rappelling gear broke into the vault of an esteemed 60-year-old safe deposit company in the heart of London over the past holiday weekend, possibly taking advantage of as many as four days to rifle through an uncounted number of safe deposit boxes. And they reportedly got away with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and cash -- even, in the educated guess of one former police official, as much as 200 million pounds, or $300 million. Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a \"slow and painstaking\" forensic examination, police said in a statement. \"Officers anticipate the process to take approximately two days,\" the statement said. \"At this stage it is believed that approximately 60-70 safe deposit boxes were opened during the burglary. Officers are working closely with Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd to establish the identities of those affected. Police will be contacting victims directly as and when they are identified.\" WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Throughout the day Wednesday, customers of the business went in and out of the premises, clearly unhappy about not being able to learn whether their boxes were among those ransacked. Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" $4.8M in gold swiped from N.C. highway. But how? The police statement did not put a value on the amount of the haul. But numerous British news organizations put the figure in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, which translates into even more hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade. But Roy Ramm, a former chief of the Flying Squad, an economic crime unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service, came up with a much higher guess. \"I would not be surprised, given where this one is, in Hatton Garden, if 200 million pounds is around about the amount stolen,\" Ramm said on BBC Radio 4. Because of the long Easter weekend, police did not hear of the robbery until Tuesday morning. This may prove to be an embarrassment, as the Telegraph newspaper reported that the alarm at the business sounded Friday but, as the front and back doors still appeared locked, no action was taken. The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\" Robbers target security vans in France jewel heist .",

Firing guns in the air is a traditional way of celebrating special occasions in some parts of Saudi Arabia and despite government efforts to stop it, the dangerous practice lingers on. Shotgun wedding: The groom's brother was caught on camera as he lost control of a Kalashnikov while firing a celebratory round into the air . Banging start: As the man starts shooting, he loses control of the rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street over the wedding guest . The incident was caught on camera, and the short clip shows the wedding party making its way towards the wedding hall when suddenly the brother of the groom starts shooting in the air. As he fires off the celebratory round, he loses control of the Kalashnikov rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street. Once he stops shooting, the video shows the guests attempt to reform a queue and act as if nothing untoward had happened, while  resuming their slow procession to the wedding. The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times.

Bad aim: The round accidentally hits the wall as the wedding procession walks and bullets ricochet . The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times . User KhalifASakar wrote: 'It was highly irresponsible on his part. If he was so keen on his kind of jubilation, he should do it in an open space away from people. 'Even though I do not know much about firearms, I can tell you he was not holding his Kalashnikov correctly.' Another, Byzanti, said: 'The police should use the video clip to identify the brother and apply the law. 'As long as there is no punishment, people will continue to act irresponsibly. Those who attempt to show off their firearm skills are usually cowards in real action.' Abu Atab posted: 'The Kalashnikov man should be tied up alongside the family sheep until the wedding is over.' The Saudi government has been calling for an end to the local tradition of firing guns into the air to celebrate weddings and birthdays, which has often resulted in accidental deaths. A government spokesman said: 'Security agencies have been told to monitor wedding halls and places of celebration to prevent this sort of thing happening. 'Those that break the law will be severely punished. We are aware of this video and relevant authorities are looking into it.'",

Around 15 animals ran away from a farm in Schodack, upstate New York, on Thursday and then swam across the Hudson River. They were all shot dead by law enforcement on Friday. The herd are pictured crossing a road in Bethlehem, New York . The owner of the farm from where they escaped say the group managed to swim across the Hudson River.

Three men hired by the farm were cleared to open fire Friday afternoon in a stream in woods in the town of Coeymans, about 10 miles south of the state capital Albany . One of the men firing at the animals gets into a heated exchange with officials before another is bundled into a car by deputies . Police say the decision was made after experts agreed tranquilizers would not be effective and no portable corrals could hold the animals. George Mesick, the farm's owner, told\u00a0Albany's Times Union they must have swam across the river to the town of Bethlehem, where they wandered Friday morning between Interstate 87 and the river's west bank. The herd crossed a local road at about 11:15 a.m. and ambled onto the Thruway in a spot 10 miles south of Albany. Drivers slowed to avoid the buffalo. The animals safely crossed the northbound lanes and then trotted south on the shoulder into some woods. Mesick had previously admitted he had little hope they would be captured unharmed. 'There is a zero percent chance of getting them back right now I think. I just want to get this done with as fast as possible so that no one gets hurt,' he said earlier on Friday. He would have tried to bring the herd in himself, but they are wild and not tame. \u00a0A police helicopter was hovering over them to make sure the group did not split.

The U.N.-sponsored talks should resume \"but only after a complete halt of attacks,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in a Facebook post. The previous round of talks between Houthi rebels and the government of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi failed in January after rebels attacked the President's personal residence and presidential palace in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly monthlong air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni government military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, according to security sources in Taiz. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. Explosions lasted for about 40 minutes, they said. It was unclear whether it was a resumption of the operation or a short-term series of strikes. Meanwhile, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa on Wednesday, according to a senior Saudi source speaking on condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back \"security and stability through establishing a political process,\" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Hadi, who claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,\" said Hadi. In the country's south, security officials on Wednesday reported two U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants in Mukalla. Six suspected militants died in the attack. This is the second drone strike in three days. On Monday, six militants were killed when drone strikes targeted two vehicles in Shabwah, west of Mukalla. A U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday that the United States is conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last few days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Nic Robertson, Salim Essaid, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.",

Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, is facing extradition and is wanted by American prosecutors after allegedly causing the 2010 Wall Street 'flash crash' and making more than \u00a326 million using a fraudulent trading technique. Sarao, of Hounslow, west London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday and was bailed with a surety of \u00a35 million. Suspected rogue trader Navinder Sarao (circled) lived in his parents' modest home because it gave him a split-second advantage worth millions of pounds . Sarao (pictured in court) spent a third night in custody last night after failing to pay the \u00a35million surety demanded by the courts to grant him bail . However, he has remained behind bars since his brief appearance, and will remain there over the weekend after an official from the magistrates' court today said it had not received the money. The spokeswoman said: 'It hasn't been paid and it can't be paid over the weekend. He will therefore remain in custody until at least Monday when he is able to pay the money.' The former Brunel University student allegedly made \u00a3550,000 in five minutes on the day of the 'Flash Crash', the biggest one-day collapse in Wall Street history. He is accused of using computer programs to create 'spoof' transactions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and faces charges which could carry a 380-year prison sentence. It's claimed he did all this from his parents' semi-detached home in Hounslow, west London, where he ran his one man trading company. He was arrested at the address on Tuesday afternoon at the request of American prosecutors. Under bail conditions he will be tagged and he has surrendered his passport and must live at the family home - keeping to a curfew of between 11pm and 4am at that address. His parents have also agreed to surrender their passports as part of the bail conditions. A full extradition hearing for Sarao has been set for August 18th and 19th, with a preliminary hearing on May 26th. Sarao's family's semi-detached house in suburban west London (pictured), from where he traded . After his arrest earlier this week made headlines across the world, details of his life have been revealed by former colleagues. One of which told MailOnline today: 'He was a super human trader - we were in awe of his ability to make money. When he left Futex he took \u00a32.5million from his account with him. That was unheard of. 'We were all encouraged to set up offshore accounts. If he has as much money as people think then that's where it'll be.' He is said to have 'loved making money, not spending it', and friend told MailOnline he would make \u00a3250,000 a day trading. Despite his alleged wealth he would travel to work late so he could buy off-peak tickets, only have lunch if he could find cut price sandwiches and shunned drinking in pubs for pints of milk at his desk.

Investigated: Between 2009 and 2014 a total of 617 youngsters aged under ten in the West Midlands either committed, of were suspected of committing, a crime, according to figures (file picture posed by model) They include 41 nine-year-old boys investigated for crimes last year including five suspected of sexual offences, according to the details released\u00a0after a Freedom of Information Act request. A nine-year-old girl was also linked to a case of criminal damage while a five-year-old girl was alleged to have committed sexual activity with a child. The legal age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten. But four-year-old children have also been investigated on suspicion of possessing cannabis, criminal damage, assault, theft and sexual activity with a child aged under 13. In both 2013 and 2014 two-year-old boys were believed to be behind assaults and in 2012 a three-year-old girl was suspected of being responsible for a theft.

Kim Ki-Jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction, the Seoul Central District Court official said. According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment. Lippert was stabbed March 5 during an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between North and South Korea. Shortly before Lippert was supposed to give a speech, the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw. The ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches. That wound measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) deep, but there was no serious facial nerve damage, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital. Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand, but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function. Police said Kim stabbed Lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of North Korea. Police official Yoon Myeong-seong told reporters that Kim had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against Lippert. Kim, 55, has a history of unpredictable behavior. In 2010, he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack. \"This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador,\" she said, \"but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated.\" CNN's Madison Park and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

A groundbreaking facial surgeon has been struck off after repeatedly punching a patient in the face 'like a boxer' to fix his broken cheekbone. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he was attempting to reduce the fracture when he hit the patient up to ten times while a colleague held his head, a medical hearing heard. The patient, known as Patient A, had come to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 after an industrial accident and been operated on by Prof Peckitt, who is a world-renowned facial surgeon. But he required a second procedure after falling off the bed in hospital which displaced his cheekbone. That's when Prof Peckitt struck the patient while he was under anesthetic. Prof Peckitt, an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery at Ipswich Hospital, claimed he 'digitally manipulated' the patient's face and denied any wrongdoing. But he was 'erased' from the medical register after the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel found that his fitness to practice was impaired. The hearing heard that\u00a0Patient A could have been blinded by the force of the punches from Professor Peckitt. Chair Dr Ian Spafford said 'under no circumstances' would it be appropriate to apply enough force to potentially damage to the optic nerve. Erica Rapaport, a dental surgeon with more than 30 years experience, said she was told to hold the patient's head before the first punch. She said she was left in 'total shock' and there were gasps from colleagues in the operating theatre as she gave a harrowing account of the procedure. 'He made his hand into a fist and he hit the patient in the face on the left side of his cheek. 'His hand was about six inches away. I think the first time he punched the patient I wasn't holding him and it was then that I was instructed to do so by Prof Peckitt. 'He said that when the patient fell out of bed, the cheekbone which was already fractured was moved outwards so he was trying to re-position it without having to make further cuts to the face. 'He said this at least after the first punch. 'He applied about ten punches like a boxer. He took aim and then punched. 'The first punch was unexpected and then he explained what he was doing. He spoke as he punched again and again.' After graduating in medicine from the University of Sheffield in 1979, Mr Peckitt completed further training with the Royal College of Surgeons of England and became a Fellow of the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery in 2009. He has lectured on titanium implants and been published in medical journals so Miss Rapaport said she came into the hospital on her day off to take part in surgery and learn about his renowned techniques. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, previously told the hearing that the case wasn't based on the outcome of the procedure but the method. Professor Peckitt didn't seek advice from colleagues and quit his post days later. He was also alleged to have failed to check the medical records of a second patient, Patient B, which led to him attempting an unnecessary procedure on her, and to have treated another, Patient C, for a complex facial deformity without seeking the advice of another surgeon. At the tribunal in Manchester, Miss Rapaport was asked to clarify the analogy by panel member Dr Shazad Amin who suggested it implied Prof Pickett took a 'larger swing'. Asked if the punch was more 'of a jab', she added: 'I meant he was looking to take aim. Professor Ninian Peckitt had been an Honorary locum consultant at Ipswich Hospital when he punched a patient to correct a broken cheekbone. He later wrote the patient's face had been 'digitally manipulated' 'When I said it was like a boxer I meant he was carefully aiming where he wanted to hit. 'Then he pulled his hand back to get the maximum hit as he touched the patient's face. 'I can remember a feeling of total shock the first time he hit the patient because I wasn't expecting it and I think anyone who saw what happened was reacting in a similar way and then he asked me to assist by holding the patient's head. '[The punches] were his fist aimed at the side of the patient's face. 'He was looking himself and inspecting it and asked if anybody thought the fracture had moved. 'I understand generally it is nice not to have to make an incision but I do not understand the uncontrolled nature of hitting someone. 'I didn't challenge him at the time. I was too shocked.' Miss Rapaport added that following the operation, Prof Peckitt told her to write that the cheek had been adjusted by 'external pressure' in her operating notes. She said: 'Prof Peckitt asked me to write up the note and I felt very challenged by what he had just done. I asked him if he would write it and he said he would dictate the exact words for me to write down. 'He said \"the left malar was adjusted by external pressure\". They were precisely his words. 'I particularly [didn't want to] write the note because accurately I would have had to write \"Prof Peckitt punched the patient to try and move the left zygoma\" and that's not something I would have wanted to do. 'I didn't challenge him. Partly because he is a consultant and partly because I was so shocked that I didn't have the strength to argue. 'I didn't see any damage, I just thought it was a very unusual technique. 'I was holding his head very still. It must have moved a little [when he punched] but not much. 'Prof Peckitt is much stronger than I am so I could only give as much support as I could so it might have moved a little. 'If I asked you to hold something still then I punched it, you don't know how hard someone is going to punch so you don't know how much resistance to apply.' Prof Peckitt has pioneered 'engineering-assisted' surgery techniques and written extensively on the subject, as well as cosmetic surgery. He is now believed to be working as a consultant surgeon in Dubai and elected not to attend the hearing but issued an email in which he 'emphatically denied' the allegations. He claimed he was being 'victimised' but the panel ignored these claims and the professor was struck off. Panel chair Ian Spafford said: 'The Panel has determined that Mr Peckitt's misconduct is fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to practise medicine. 'Therefore, it has determined that, in the particular circumstances of this case, it would not be sufficient nor proportionate to suspend his registration. 'The Panel is of the view that the public interest requires that it be made clear that Mr Peckitt's behaviour is unacceptable in a member of the medical profession. 'The Panel has determined to direct that Mr Peckitt's name be erased from the Medical Register. 'In the light of all the evidence presented to it, it is satisfied that erasure is a proportionate sanction in his case.'",

Derby had been in control until Matej Vydra fired them ahead in the 23rd minute after Cyrus Christie lost the ball out on the right but a mistake by Ben Watson just before half-time changed the game.

Tom Ince put Johnny Russell in and Marco Motta's wild challenge saw him red-carded before Darren Bent coolly drove the penalty into the top right corner. When Ince burst into the box and turned one way and then the other before bending the ball low past Heurelho Gomes in the 57th minute, it looked bleak for Watford but they hit back when Adlene Guedioura cleverly played in Odion Ighalo to beat Lee Grant from 12 yards in the 75th minute. Bent was denied by the legs of Gomes two minutes later and the keeper leapt to tip over a Richard Keogh header in the final seconds of stoppage time but McClaren knew a great chance had already slipped away. 'We are 2-1 up and I think the plan is going great and then we stopped,' he said. 'We started to get negative and think the game was won and that's the disappointment. 'We have to be ruthless, we have to go for the third and fourth and kill teams off but we played as if it was the last two minutes of the game and just tried to keep the ball and they were never going to accept that. 'It's very frustrating for everyone but we only have ourselves to blame for not taking advantage and not winning that game and getting back in the race. 'I said at half-time we need three goals to win this game, we got the second and I thought we would go on but we didn't go on. There's anger and frustration but we've got six games to go and we can't feel sorry for ourselves. 'We've got to react and use the anger and make sure on Monday that we are more ruthless because the performances are still good but we are conceding bad goals.' Watford head coach Slavisa Jokanovic was 'proud' of the way his team responded to move to within a point of the top two. Matej Vydra (left) smiles to the crowd after putting Watford 1-0 up with his fifth goal in seven matches . Darren Bent slotted the penalty past\u00a0Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal to level the scores at 1-1 . Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic was proud of his team's fight in the 2-2 draw against Derby . He said: 'I am proud because we believed we could change the situation, which is good news with six games in front of us. 'We must be brave and believe in our possibilities. I am always confident in my team because if the players play with confidence, they believe they are a good team and can change the situation in the second half. 'In my opinion (Motta's foul) was not enough for a sending-off but the referee has another opinion and that's it. Derby play good football but my team play good football too.'",

The 32-year-old was inspecting a weapons factory in the country's capital of Pyongyang in a visit filmed by North Korean Central TV. The footage shows the mysterious dictator waving and smiling to the crowds, with his right-hand wrist wrapped up in a white bandage. Scroll down for video . Pictures from state-controlled media show the dictator smiling and waving, with his right wrist in bandages . It is the latest in a string of presumed health problems for the North Korean dictator, aged 32 . According to a South Korean official, quoted in Sky News, Jong-Un must have suffered the injury in the recent past. 'He didn't have the injury when he inspected a military unit on April 4,' the government spokesman said, 'so it must be recent.' Doctors who have examined the photos say it is unlikely that he has fractured his wrist, and judged it to be a minor injury. The state of Kim Jong-Un's health is the subject of fascination around the globe, as he presides over the world's most secretive state. Kim Jong-un resurfaced after six weeks of no appearances in October, walking with the help of a walking stick. There were rumours that he had had a gastric band fitted, or suffering from gout which put pressure on his feet . Pictured here with army generals in 2012, King Jong-Un is named the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He has previously revealed plans to launch nuclear strikes on US cities . In autumn 2014 he vanished for six weeks after he was spotted limping across a stage - sparking speculation that an attempted coup in the country or health problems including a leg injury, gout or a gastric band operation were behind the disappearance.. During that time state media reported he was suffering from an unnamed 'uncomfortable physical condition'. He re-appeared in October, walking with the help of a black cane.",

The songwriter, who penned the 1983 anthem, said the song - like many of his others - was about compassion, tolerance and inclusiveness. But it has emerged the hit was played at one of the rallies, which aimed to oppose 'sharia law, halal tax and Islamisation'. Scroll down for video . Former Redgum frontman John Schumann (pictured front centre) has slammed protesters for using his song, I Was Only 19 at a Reclaim Australia rally . A YouTube video shows I Was Only 19 being performed at Reclaim Australia's Gold Coast protest. Saturday's rallies across the nation erupted into violence when the group's supporters clashed with anti-racism groups. After footage of Schumann's song being played surfaced, the singer released a statement on Sunday to condemn its use. He said I Was Only 19 was written to help people understand the plight of Vietnam veterans. Saturday's Reclaim Australia rallies across the nation erupted into violence when the group's supporters clashed with anti-racism groups . Schumann said his songs were about promoting tolerance, compassion and inclusiveness . 'I am very, very disappointed to see my work co-opted by what I, at my most charitable, consider to be a very confused \"patriotic\" movement,' Schumann said. The song honours all Australians who have put themselves in harm's way for their country, he said. 'It is not to be used to advance ignorance and intolerance, especially as we approach the centenary of Anzac,' Schumann said. There were several arrests at the rallies, including three in Melbourne where more than 3,000 people clashed in Federation Square and blocked surrounding streets.

Hundreds of police formed barricades to separate protesters but scuffles still broke out and some people were treated by paramedics for minor injuries. Earlier on Sunday, federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said there was no excuse for the violence. 'There's no place for violence in any protests or any expressions of freedom of speech,' Mr Shorten told the Nine Network. He also said any suggestion that Muslims were planning to bring Sharia law to Australia was exaggerated. 'It was 50-60 years ago people said that the Irish Catholics or the Catholics were trying to take over the joint - and that wasn't true either,' Mr Shorten said.",

The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea's previous two matches, however. Thibaut Courtois (centre) was in phenomenal form as Chelsea beat rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . Courtois (centre) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a  goal for Hull on March 22 . Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull (left) but was back on form against QPR on Sundat . His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend. But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result. 'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said. 'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team. 'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen. 'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem. Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke . Courtois (right) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea . 'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy. 'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won. 'I'm 22 and still learning.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nWashington (CNN)It's the mistake that Hillary Clinton won't make again: ignoring her gender. The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University.  \"People are ready for a woman president.  The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\" According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again . In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough. She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on. The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history. But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics. \"She is the gender card.  She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it. She is the woman candidate. She has shared women's experiences. Being a mom and a grandmother,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.  \"She will just naturally bring it in. If she overplayed it, which she won't, it could backfire.\" Republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the Obama years.  The Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's president, put it this way at the group's recent annual meeting: \"Eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\" Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didn't think it would be Clinton. \"There's a couple of things there. Trust, honesty -- those get in her way,\" Blackburn said. \"As we talk about the polling that is out there, that gets in Hillary's way and she's not authentic.\" In 2014, Democratic candidates such as former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits. Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues. And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans. Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\" \"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. \"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign.  You aren't going to win 100% of women.\" Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men. Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness. \"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said. And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell. But Clinton will have some high-profile champions. Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. \"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I'm ready for Hillary. And America is ready for Hillary. She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\" At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\" In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes. But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.",

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.",

The Brazilian defender went off after 35 minutes of PSG's 3-2 win over Marseille after suffering an injjury to his left leg. Shortly after his side had fallen behind in their top of the table clash,the Brazilian was running away from a Marseille player, before being caught by a stray leg. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury . The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . The former-Chelsea defender attempted to continue breaking forward, but pulled up sharply holding his hamstring a couple of yards later. The club's official English Twitter account confirmed it was a muscle pull, tweeting: '@DavidLuiz_4 crumples to the floor with a hamstring pull #OMPSG' Reports suggest the 27-year-old will have scans on Monday to assess the extent of the injury. If it is serious as suggested then Luiz will surely be a doubt for PSG's upcoming games with Saint-Etienne, Bastia and Barcelona, whom the French side face in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on April 15. in his absence the French champions looked less than assured, conceding a second poor goal just a few minutes after Luiz departed, but they rallied to win the game and return to the top of the table with a better second-half display.

A large crowd erupted in cheers as Pemba Tamang was carried out on a stretcher. He was wearing a New York shirt and a blue neck brace, was blanketed by dust and had the look of a deer in the headlights. His rescuer, Inspector Lakshman Basnet of the Nepalese Armed Police Force, said Tamang was responsive and showed no apparent signs of serious injury. He was given an IV drip and rushed from the Gongapur area to a temporary emergency hospital run by an Israeli aid team. The Nepalese rescuers had been working for five hours to locate Tamang after they heard his voice coming from under the debris. Also Thursday, a U.S. special operations forces team rescued 30 people, including three Americans, by helicopter from an area of Nepal called Bamboo Village, according to the U.S. ambassador to Nepal. The group was trapped in the village and living in a makeshift shelter, Ambassador Peter Bodde said. The families had contacted the U.S. government to let officials know where their relatives were stuck, he said. They had no other way to get out of the area, Bodde said. An American disaster response team was also involved in the rescue of the 15 year old boy. The team was at a nearby damaged bus station when it got word that someone might be alive. Andrew Olvera, the head of the U.S. team, said his men rushed over with search dogs and equipment ranging from breaching tools to sophisticated cameras that can probe under the rubble. He said the operation carried enormous risk, as chunks of the collapsed building hung precariously on rebar. Entire floors of what used to be people's homes were visible -- ceiling fans and beds still draped with cotton sheets. It was a mountain of loss and sorrow. \"It's dangerous, but it's what we do,\" said Olvera, who has a daughter and twin 11-year-old boys. \"It's risk versus gain. To save a human life, we will risk almost everything. \"The way the building is, it's definitely a miracle,\" he said. Tamang cried for water in a muffled voice. He had been buried for five days under a building that pancaked. He dodged death because of a motorcycle that shielded him from the pressure of the concrete and steel, according to Basnet. And, Basnet said, he \"survived by good faith.\" Dennis Bautista, who went down to where Tamang was buried to administer medical aid, called the rescue amazing. \"It feels good to be able to help out. I can't imagine what he went through,\" Bautista said. \"He is a brave young man.\" Basnet said once he got closer to Tamang, he tried to reassure him that he would be OK. \"I gave him water and talked to him regularly,\" Basnet said. After Tamang was rushed to the hospital, the US Agency for International Development team continued the search. The possibility remained that someone else might have survived, like Tamang. Other search and rescue teams continued to scour through Kathmandu's rubble Thursday. They are looking for survivors from the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Saturday, killing at least 6,134 people and wounding almost 14,000, according to Nepali authorities. Another 72 people were reported dead in India and 25 in China. In Nepal, 19 of the deaths occurred on Mount Everest, where the quake triggered deadly avalanches. Despite the disaster, Nepali authorities plans to reopen routes up the mountain as soon as next week. Teams are clearing paths and and rebuilding ladders, Tourism Ministry spokesman Krishna Sapkota told CNN on Thursday. Officials are encouraging people who have already received permission to climb this season to go ahead with their plans. As the chances dimmed for finding people alive in the wreckage left by the quake across Nepal, Tamang's rescue boosted hopes for all those who still have loved ones and friends missing. Other people have been saved from under collapsed buildings in previous days, including a 27-year-old man on Tuesday and a 4-month-old boy on Sunday. The Nepali military also released a photo of a dust-caked 11-year-old girl who they said was rescued Wednesday after 90 hours under the rubble. The rescuers, meanwhile, have no intention of giving up looking for more. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Olvera said, revised the benchmark for what was thought possible for survival. A man there was miraculously pulled from the rubble after 27 long days. 360-degree view of earthquake zone . CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.",

McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results allied to the revelation that he receives a cut of transfer fees for United players sales. Since selling prize assets Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic for \u00a32million on transfer deadline day, United have won just once, in a Scottish Cup tie at Stranraer. Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong has backed under-fire Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara . McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results . After 10 games without a win, the heat was turned up on McNamara on Wednesday night when United lost 3-1 at Dens Park \u2013 their first derby defeat to Dundee since November 2004. However, as McNamara comes under increasing pressure from United fans, some of whom believe his position is untenable, Armstrong yesterday backed his old boss to ride out the most testing period of his managerial career. \u2018Jackie McNamara is a good guy. He was always really nice to me when I was at United - and he is capable of turning it around,\u2019 said the 23-year-old. Celtic unveil former Dundee Utd teammates Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven following their exit . \u2018Yes, United are having woes just now. They are on a bad run of form, and the injuries aren\u2019t really helping either. But these things happen in football. I am sure Jackie McNamara and United will turn it around \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u2019 Asked yesterday if this spell was the toughest test so far of his managerial career, McNamara said: \u2018Not really. We went through a spell last year but it\u2019s things I\u2019ll learn from. I am learning so it\u2019s been good in that sense. \u2018I\u2019ve learned different things, reasons for things and different scenarios recently. I think that will stand me in good stead.\u2019 Mackay-Steven (right) celebrates his goal with former Dundee United teammate John Rankin . Ex-United defender Mark Wilson, who also left Tannadice in January, insists the root of the current crisis at United has been their losing streak - not the manager\u2019s controversial bonus scheme. United face Hamilton today, who have not won in 12 matches, and Wilson believes \u2018bruised figure\u2019 McNamara can win back the fans if he can restore his team to winning ways. \u2018The bonus row doesn\u2019t sit well with the fans,\u2019 conceded Wilson. \u2018But that\u2019s purely because the team is losing. If the team was winning it would all be brushed under the carpet. \u2018Does the manager look a bruised figure right now? Yes, but you can see why! He\u2019 s built a successful attacking team and his players are getting ripped away. Former Dundee United ace Armstrong celebrates with Mackay-Steven after scoring for Celtic . 'You don\u2019t know whether the players had clauses, or whether it\u2019s been a decision made at the top of the club, but if you took Armstrong and Mackay Steven out of any team it would leave a massive hole. 'Take away Andrew Robertson and Ryan Gauld, who were sold last summer, that\u2019s four mainstays of last year\u2019s team now gone. \u2018Those are big shoes to fill, and I\u2019m sure the likes of Aidan Connolly and Blair Spitall, if given time, will do that. Jackie has shown he can go out and buy and rear genuine stars. I believe there is still enough quality there for United to grind out results and start climbing up the league.\u2019",

A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to The Washington Post. \"The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her,\" and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he \"grabbed her arms when she resisted\" and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that  Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations \"very disturbing.\" \"Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. Earlier in September, an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched \"beyond its limits,\" needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. \"It's going to take time to change some of this culture,\" Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month. \"There's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain. That's going to take time because I'm going to have to build trust with our workforce.\" The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.",

Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. \"At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint,\" Jamie Davis said.  \"That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us.\" As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. \"At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known,\" said Troi Ge.  \"He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'\" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" Collins said. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.",

Brendan Rodgers has killed off Lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining Liverpool \u2013 why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker \u2013 playing regularly in the Premier League and scoring goals for Southampton. He'd just been to a World Cup. Rickie Lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining Liverpool despite their striking problems . Brendan Rodgers' decision to ignore Lambert, in favour of Mario Balotelli, is completely illogical . This time last year Lambert was about to play at a World Cup for England but his stock has fallen since . For Rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware Lambert isn't Luis Suarez, I know he's not a world-class striker. Lambert missed out on Saturday at West Brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see Mario Balotelli get yet another chance. The England striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any Liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of Premier League minutes on the pitch Lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six-and-a-half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football . When he has started in the Premier League or Champions League, Lambert and Liverpool have impressed . On his first Premier League start for Liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, Liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, Balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver. He has to go down as Liverpool's worst-ever signing \u2013 at least the club won a trophy when Andy Carroll was at Anfield. How come Balotelli got more time on the pitch at Wembley last weekend than Lambert? And what about Saturday? Balotelli was hopeless yet again. Whether you watch his performance or check the stats, he was useless \u2013 not for the first time this season. Ultimately it'd be wrong to suggest Lambert was going to be the man to spearhead Liverpool's charge to the title and a Champions League challenge. But to be so underused in a season when Daniel Sturridge has been missing for so long, and Balotelli has been ineffective, is inexplicable. Balotelli, no matter which way you look at it, has been useless, and Lambert should be picked ahead of him . Balotelli was given more time on the pitch than Lambert in Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa . Lambert scored 20 goals for Southampton - he may not be world class, but he is better than the alternatives . Lambert should have joined Aston Villa in January. But he found out about the move just a few hours before the transfer window closed and chose to stay. Rodgers told Lambert that he didn't want him to go. Why say that and then not bother using him? Nobody can ever take away the fact that Lambert has scored for his boyhood club Liverpool in the Premier League and the Champions League. And Lambert is the kind of guy who will treasure those special moments and keep them close to his heart. But he's lost his England place and his reputation as a Premier League striker has been seriously undermined by Rodgers and Liverpool this season.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)The United States has gained much from its position as a space-faring nation. Indeed, U.S. access to space has provided incredible benefit to U.S. national security, defense and the economic well-being of the nation. And in order to effectively confront current and future conflicts, combat terrorism and counter the proliferating threats worldwide, our military depends on space-based capabilities, including intelligence, GPS, and communications satellites. Unfortunately, as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates, the U.S. is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on Russian technology to meet our national security obligations. How? For a start, we depend on the Atlas V rocket, which carries many of our most important satellites and is powered by the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine. The fact that we rely on Russia, currently under sanctions for invading a sovereign nation, should reinforce the need for a change in our current course. Assured access to space is an area where the U.S. should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains, which are subject to disruption, threats, unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the U.S. The Ukraine crisis should have served as a wake-up call, highlighting the danger of dependence on Russia to launch national security satellites into space. And the United States should play no part in supporting the defense industry of a country that continues to abrogate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Simply put, it is bad policy to rely on others for critical national security requirements, and worse policy when this reliance supports countries taking action in direct contradiction to U.S. national security interests. Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defense and space industries, has called American taxpayer outlays for the Russian engine \"free money\" that goes directly back into Russia's missile modernization programs. It is high time the U.S. government turn to its existing domestic capability and turn off this flow of funds. Fortunately, there are some signs of progress. Last year, Congress took bipartisan action to phase out reliance on the RD-180 engine by the end of the decade, and to transition to an all-American space launch capability. The defense authorization for fiscal year 2015 included restrictions on the future use of the RD-180 for the Atlas V, authorizing $220 million to begin development of a U.S. alternative. This was a wise move, but it's not enough. There are steps that the United States can take now to ensure our access to space and secure our comparative advantage in space -- and in the world. True, development of a new launch system will take time; there are no overnight answers. However, a combination of existing capabilities and dynamic development of new capabilities by the private sector can serve as a foundation for eliminating any capability gap in the U.S. space program. Indeed, new entrants are coming online using launch vehicle systems fully designed and manufactured in America. The two main launch competitors -- United Launch Alliance and SpaceX -- each have all-American systems, namely ULA's Delta IV family of rockets and SpaceX's Falcon 9. Having both options will put America on the path to fielding its indigenous space capabilities for the next generation, while strengthening a space industrial base weakened since the end of the Cold War. The short-term goal should be to transition to existing American-manufactured launch vehicles, as opposed to phasing out systems such as the Delta IV, which continue to provide critical capability. In the long term, next-generation development programs should not involve major Russian subsystems and components. It is time to end America's reliance on Russia's rocket engine. This would be good for national security, good for American innovation and the industrial base -- and good for our country's future.",

It is little surprise the Fuhrer later banned the absurdly camp woodland snap, calling it \u2018beneath one\u2019s dignity\u2019. But the rare archive photo, and several other portraits as comical as they are chilling, have been discovered in a Hitler \u2018fan magazine\u2019 from the Thirties. In lederhosen and knee-high socks, Adolf Hitler lounges against a tree. The Fuhrer later banned the absurdly camp woodland snap, calling it \u2018beneath one\u2019s dignity\u2019 Hitler seems ill at ease with his hands, squeezing them into his tight lederhosen pockets in one photo, and perching them awkwardly on his hips in another. In one ridiculous picture, he tilts his head and tries a mean and moody stare to camera, topped off by a military cap. It must have felt better than it looked, for after seeing the portrait, he never wore the cap again. In another photo, Hitler tries to strike a casual-yet-serious pose as he balances on the edge of a log cabin veranda showing off his knobbly knees. A snap of him relaxing in a deckchair in a meadow is proof, were it needed, that in those days leaders did not have expert public relations advisers close at hand. The theatrical wartime leader\u2019s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann took many of the black and white photos for Hitler\u2019s own use. But they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) - full of hero worship and pin-up pictures of the Fuhrer, published by his fervent henchman Baldur von Shirach. A tattered copy of the magazine was found by a British soldier in a bombed German house after the war. Souvenir-hunting Pioneer Corps private Alf Roberts, from Barnsley, Yorkshire, brought it home along with a German medal\u00a0and bayonet. Now, 70 years later, military historians have had it translated and are about to publish it in Britain. Von Shirach gushes: \u2018We who have had the privilege of being able to work with him have come to worship and love him.\u2019 He describes the mass-murdering monster as \u2018honest, steadfast and modest\u2019 displaying \u2018strength and kindness\u2019 and whose \u2018soul brushed against the stars\u2019. The theatrical wartime leader\u2019s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann took many of the black and white photos for Hitler\u2019s own use, but they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) His poetic fawning continues page after page, but the magazine is nonetheless a compelling read thanks to the ludicrous vanity of the Fuhrer photos. Von Shirach was only 18 when he met Hitler in Munich in 1925. He quickly moved up the National Socialist ranks through his leadership of the Nazi students association. In 1945 he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in Berlin-Spandau prison. He died in 1974. Photographer Hoffmann died in 1957. He had also introduced Hitler to his assistant, Eva Braun, who became his lover and died with him in 1945. Translation of the \u2018fanzine\u2019 was made difficult by it having been buried in the rubble of a bombed house and having suffered water damage. But with salvaged illustrations and some replacement photos, it is to be published this month by military experts Pen & Sword Books under the title The Rise of Hitler. Translator Trevor Salisbury said: \u2018The book is typical of the propaganda of the time, with the obvious non-critical acceptance of everything Hitler was and what he stood for. \u2018It attempted to present him as a peace-loving man who dearly loved children and was kind to all. As we all know, the truth was completely different.\u2019",

However, FIFA did something similar during a 2006 World Cup qualifier. Back in 2005 Uzbekistan were playing Bahrain in the Asian zone fourth-round play-off first leg when Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida incorrectly awarded an indirect free-kick to Bahrain after the Uzbeks had encroached at their penalty kick when 1-0 up. This happened in the 38th minute and FIFA ordered that the entire match be replayed which did not please either team. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier in Belfast . Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute . Leah Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway . Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . Bahrain players and staff celebrate after beating Uzbekistan in a 2006 World Cup qualifier on away goals . Have UEFA just triggered a landmark moment for football? Final 18 seconds of England match to be replayed after ref disallowed penalty for encroachment... and gave indirect free-kick instead. Read more HERE. Uzbekistan only managed a 1-1 draw in the replay and a 0-0 scoreline in the second leg in Manama meant that Bahrain qualified. Current FIFA head of refereeing, Massimo Busacca, was in charge for the first-leg rematch and I was appointed to the second leg in Bahrain. It was surprising to receive four or five calls on the day of that game from FIFA stressing how important it was that the game passed without any errors in law which would provoke another appeal. Winding forward to the latest incident which was caused, incredibly, by an identical error by German referee, Marija Kurtes, in the 96th minute of England\u2019s 2-1 'defeat' by Norway in their qualifying group. England thought they had scored an equaliser in the dying seconds of the game from the penalty spot but Kurtes had spotted encroachment by at least one England player and rightly disallowed the goal. Had the penalty been missed she would have been correct to award an indirect free kick but as it had been scored she should have ordered a retake. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Marija Kurtes incorrectly awarded an indirect free kick after disallowing a penalty . Kurtes has been sent home from the European Women's U19 qualifiers after her mistake . Now, UEFA has upheld England\u2019s appeal and ordered that in an evolution of the FIFA decision in 2005, the game should be replayed from the moment the technical error occurred. This bizarre decision was perhaps influenced by the fact that both teams are still present in the host city, Belfast, and are available following their final qualifying matches. However, this sets a dangerous precedent. If the same error is made in the opening minutes of a late group match in next year\u2019s European Championship finals in France, will that match be replayed and the schedule of the whole tournament be thrown into disarray? I almost caused just that at Germany 2006; my error, in not sending Josip Simunic off when showing him his second yellow card, could not be disputed and given FIFA\u2019s decision in the qualifying stages of the same competition they would have struggled not to allow a rematch. The game was 2-2 at the time of the mistake and it stayed that way until the final whistle but had Croatia scored they would have \u2018qualified\u2019. I remember being told by the Australians that had Croatia scored a winning goal in the final three or four minutes they would have appealed and expected a rematch at the very least. Precedent set; now let\u2019s wait for the next refereeing error. It will happen \u2013 and UEFA must just hope it doesn\u2019t affect one of their premiere tournaments. Referee Graham Poll shows a yellow card to Croatia's Josip Simunic during a 2006 World Cup match . Poll sends Simunic off but only after he had failed to show a red card after a second booking .",

Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Bernie Sanders, my Vermont senator and, indeed, a friend of many years, is now running for president.  He noted at his announcement (with a familiar note of wise irony):  \"People should not underestimate me.\" To most Americans, of course, Sen. Bernie Sanders is only a name, if that.  He is barely known to the general public, which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation. Those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left-wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the Senate, as we did in 2006.  Let me add this, as someone who has followed him closely (and with admiration) for a long time:  When people stop to listen to Bernie, they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is, without a question, an authentic voice who speaks without fear. And nobody should underestimate him. I remember when Bernie was mayor of Burlington; it is the largest city in Vermont (which isn't saying much).  I met him then, and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before.  He spoke with a throaty Brooklyn accent, and he was Jewish -- not your typical Vermonter. He served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of Lake Champlain with remarkable energy for many years, listening closely to what people had to say, learning about politics at the local level, making a real difference in the daily lives of hard-working people. He was never a Democrat -- and isn't yet.  He's a progressive, holding his seat in the U.S. Senate as an independent, although he votes with the Democrats on major issues. When Bernie decided to run for Jim Jeffords' seat in the House of Representatives in 1988, many considered him a long shot.  I remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse, where Bernie held the floor for almost two hours, answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce, funny, entertaining, passionate voice.  Bernie won that seat, again and again. Make no mistake about this:  Vermont isn't just a rainbow-colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets.  It's an agricultural economy, and Bernie has understood this well.  He has thoughtfully supported Vermont's dairy-farming community over many years.  He has also been a strong supporter of Vermont's hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left, who wonder why the NRA doesn't attack him. I was never prouder of Bernie than during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.  He was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the House, strongly opposing the 2003 invasion.  He saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in American history, one with endless repercussions. He was especially outraged by the outing of former CIA spy Valerie Plame in 2006 by an official from the Pentagon, and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the Iraq War in the first place. This was typical of Bernie: The clear voice in the midst of the crowd, the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly. So what would it look like if, by some bizarre chance, Bernie caught fire and became President? He would certainly work hard for universal health care, which has been a passion of his.  I've heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single-payer system -- that has worked well throughout Europe for decades, reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well. He would not be Wall Street's best friend.  Indeed, he didn't support President George W. Bush in his efforts to bail out the bankers, and wrote an open letter to Henry Paulson, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, protesting that bailout.  Famously, on December 10, 2010, he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate opposing the reinstatement of Bush-era tax cuts, a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand Bernie's views. He is a socialist, of course.  How many American politicians have ever said this aloud?   And what does he really mean by that term? Bernie knows what he's doing.  By proclaiming himself a socialist, he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks, many with international bases, have controlled American public policy for a very long time, usually to the detriment of working people. And it's working people who seem mostly to interest Bernie Sanders.  He has been one of only a few voices in the Senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right-wing factions funded by \"millionaires and billionaires\" (one of Bernie's favorite mantras) have held sway over American politics for as long as anyone can recall. And this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads, serve meals, deliver the mail, drive trucks and teach in schools. As president, Bernie would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change.   Indeed, Bernie co-sponsored with Barbara Boxer the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007.   He has, for years, been a tireless advocate for the environment, aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad. But does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the Democratic nomination?  And if he won it, could he defeat a Republican candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal? He's not crazy.  In fact, he's probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes.  But he can't win, and he knows that.  What he will do, however, is move Hillary Clinton on matters of importance to progressives: The restraining of Wall Street and large corporations, the scandal of how America allows its political campaigns to be funded  and the welfare of working class Americans, who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests. A steep climb looms before him.  But I applaud Bernie Sanders.  I hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard.",

Niloofar Rahmani, 23, has defied death threats from the terror group and even members of her own extended family to become the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and the first female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Captain Rahmani and nine other inspirational women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award 2015 at a ceremony last week. Scroll down for video . Captain Niloofar Rahmani, 23, (pictured) is the first female female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 . Last week she and nine other women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award . Captain Rahmani is the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and has received death threats from the Taliban . She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit  pilots. Captain Rahmani said that ever since she was a little girl she had dreamed of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English in order to be able to attend flight school. She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant. She flew her first solo flight in a Cessna 182 and decided she wanted to fly even larger aircraft so she attended advanced flight school and was soon flying the C-208 military cargo aircraft. While women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers Captain Rahmani defied orders when she discovered injured soldiers when she landed during a mission. She flew the injured men to hospital and reported her actions to her superiors who chose not to impose sanctions on her. When her achievements were publicised Captain Rahmani's family received threats from both family members and the Taliban, who disapproved of her ambition and career choices. She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit pilots and immediately applied . She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant . The family has been forced to move several times for safety reasons. But Captain Rahmani is resolute and says she eventually aims to become a flight instructor to inspire other women and in spite of the Taliban's threats says she remains determined to continue her career in the Afghan Air Force and work as frequently as her security situation permits. She is also deeply committed to encouraging other young women to join the cadre of female AAF pilots. 'You can't just see yourself as a woman, but as a human and believe in yourself,' Captain Rahmani told WTKR. 'It was not easy finishing flight school, it was very hard, but someone had to accept the risk so that other women can do what they dream.' At the award ceremony last week First Lady Michelle Obama honored Rahmani's bravery, commitment, and empowerment of women and girls in Afghanistan. Established in 2007, the annual Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award honors women around the globe who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women\u2019s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk. While she and her family have received death threats Captain Rahmani says it's her responsibility to be an example to the young girls after her .

The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government\u2019s health promotions agency, which says more action is needed to tackle the \u2018continuing problem\u2019 of \u2018hazardous alcohol consumption in young people\u2019. The move would apply in pubs, clubs, supermarkets and off-licences in Scotland. New measure: Health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking . If introduced it would mean the legal minimum age for buying alcohol would be higher in Scotland than it is in the rest of Britain, where it is 18. Last night Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said he would welcome the minimum age being set at 21. He said: \u2018If it was 21 now, I would not be calling for it to be lowered.\u2019 But he added: \u2018Given the fact that we are where we are, I think that politically it is quite difficult, when the age is 18 for so many other adult rites in our society.\u2019 The proposal to raise the legal age is outlined in a report titled \u2018Best Preventative Investments for Scotland \u2013 What the Evidence and Experts Say\u2019, which examines mea-sures to improve public health. It says the idea to \u2018increase the minimum legal drinking age to 21 would be highly cost-effective, as it would both improve people\u2019s health without having to spend much money, and reduce demand on the NHS\u2019. Report author Neil Craig said: \u2018In Scotland, hazardous alcohol consumption in young people is a continuing problem. \u2018For both males and females, the largest increase in hospitalisation rates for alcohol-related conditions since the early 1980s has been in the 15-24 year olds, and this was particularly marked for females.\u2019 In fact, doctors across the whole of Britain are worried about the increase in such hospitalisations. Between 2002 and 2010, the number of admissions to English hospitals among 15 to 24 year olds due to alcohol rose by 66 per cent to 55,655 \u2013 or more than 150 a day. The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government\u2019s health promotions agency . The increase among women (76 per cent) was higher than in men (57 per cent). While the Government in Westminster has been reluctant to legislate to tackle the alcohol problem, the Scottish Government has had far fewer reservations. It has already agreed a 50p minimum unit price for alcohol, although the controversial move will not be implemented if the Scottish Whisky Association succeeds in an ongoing court battle to block it. The Scottish Government has also banned \u2018BOGOF\u2019 (buy-one-get-one-free) deals and other offers encouraging bulk-buying of alcohol, and reduced the drink driving limit. A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u2018We remain open to the consideration of any evidence-based proposals that can contribute to reducing alcohol-related harm.\u2019 A Department of Health spokesman in London said: \u2018There are no plans to increase the legal age for buying alcohol.\u2019",

And now that status update about jetting off on holiday is set to be even easier after Virgin Atlantic announced it would allow each passenger one Facebook login for free so they can post an update from 35,000ft. The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",
