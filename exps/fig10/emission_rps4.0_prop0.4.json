Three-time winner Faldo has confirmed he will cross the famous Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory on the Old Course, having also lifted the Claret Jug at Muirfield in 1987 and 1992. Faldo, whose 58th birthday falls on the Saturday of the championship, said: 'The Open and St Andrews will forever hold a significant place in my heart. My fondest moments on my journey with this great sport are woven with pictures and emotions in this setting. It all means a huge amount to me. Sir Nick Faldo (left) and Tom Watson will compete at The Open for the last time at St Andrews in July . Watson will walk across the Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory there . 'I look forward to celebrating all that golf has given me as I cross that storied bridge and the wonderful memories I share with many people. I am grateful for it all and grateful to golf.' R&A chief executive Peter Dawson added: 'Sir Nick Faldo is an inspirational figure in British golf and has enjoyed a remarkable career in The Open. 'He has delighted the galleries over many years with his three victories and consistently outstanding performances. I'm sure there will be great anticipation among the galleries at St Andrews to see him play in The Open once again and he will receive a rousing ovation worthy of a great champion.' Five-time Open champion Watson, who lost a play-off at Turnberry in 2009 at the age of 59, received a special exemption from the R&A to play his final Open in 2015, the 40th anniversary of his first victory at Carnoustie. He and Faldo will be joined by the likes of Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson in the Champion Golfers' Challenge on Wednesday, July 15, a four-hole team event played on the first, second, 17th and 18th on the eve of the championship. Almost 10,000 spectators will be able to watch from seats on the first, 17th and 18th, with a two-tiered grandstand created behind the 18th green for the first time and an L-shaped arena behind the 17th green, as well as the traditional seats to the right of the first. The grandstand behind the famous Road Hole will have a capacity of more than 4,000, with a total of 21,000 seats around the entire course. Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, executive director of championships at the R&A, said: 'There is always an incredible atmosphere at The Open and particularly when it is held in St Andrews. We want to make sure as many spectators as possible can experience that unique atmosphere and enjoy wonderful views of the play on the opening and closing holes at St Andrews. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson paid tribute to the achievements of Faldo during his career . Tom Watson (right) poses with the Claret Jug alongside runner-up in 1975, Jack Newton (left) Rory McIlroy is the current holder of the Claret Jug and will defend the title at St Andrews this year . 'The new arena will provide a fantastic setting for the climax of the Championship at the 72nd hole and will be the ideal place for spectators to greet the new champion golfer of the year.' Several cameras have been implanted into bunkers on the course, with another 'turf camera' giving views of the R&A clubhouse from in front of the first tee. The R&A has also invested \u00a3150,000 in subsidising food and drink prices, meaning the price of fish and chips, for example, is down from \u00a310.50 to \u00a38.50.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man, told CNN on Thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident. \"One of the officers told me to stop, but it was because I (said) to them that what they did it was an abuse and I witnessed everything,\" he told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\u02da.\" Santana told Cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work. In other interviews, Santana has said he feared for his life, which almost kept him from revealing the recording. Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday. That evidence led to the officer's firing and arrest on a murder charge. Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He could hear the sound of a Taser in use. At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser. He believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana told CNN. Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser. After Slager shot Scott five times, the officer went back to pick up something. Santana thinks it was the Taser but said he wasn't 100% sure what it was. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording. What we know about Officer Slager . The cell phone video, which Santana revealed this week, reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of African-Americans and led to a murder charge against Slager, who is white. Scott was black. Police said Slager pulled the 50-year-old Scott over for a nonworking brake light on Saturday morning. Scott, according to a dash cam video, fled from Slager for unexplained reasons, and the officer chased him on foot. When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager. The video shows Slager shooting at Scott eight times before Scott falls down. Who was Walter Scott? Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward. \"He was there. God planned that. He's the ram in the bush -- I truly believe that,\" Judy Scott said. Santana agreed. \"I think she was right,\" he said. \"God put me there for a reason.\" Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording. \"When I saw my son running and I saw the policeman behind him, I couldn't take it,\" she said. \"I had to turn away. I couldn't handle it. In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution. \"At some point I thought about staying anonymous, and don't show my face, don't talk about it. But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am,\" Santana said. Santana did not say whether he had received threats. His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention. In the last half of the video, a second officer appears to examine Scott with gloved hands. Witness video, official accounts raise questions . Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR. A police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid, and that the third officer approached and helped that person \"with first aid and CPR.\" On Wednesday, asked whether CPR was performed on Scott, North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" A timeline of events .

Interviewer Diane Sawyer looked shocked when he made the revelation on her ABC 20/20 special last night. Jenner said 'I've always been on the more conservative side' when he was asked about LGBT issues - and replied 'yes' when asked if he was a Republican. Sawyer had mentioned President's decision to identify trans citizens in his most recent State of The Union address. Jenner said:\u00a0\u201cHe actually was the first one to say the actual word transgender, I will certainly give him credit for that.' 'But not to get political, I\u2019ve just never been a big fan \u2014 I\u2019m kind of more on the conservative side.' Scroll down for video . Republican: Bruce Jenner told Diane Sawyer he is a Republican as he announced his transition to a woman on Friday night . Jenner added that neither the Republicans nor Democrats had a 'monopoly on understanding' and said he would lobby the GOP over LGBT rights. 'I would do that, yeah, in a heartbeat,' he said. He also said in the interview that he still considers himself a heterosexual, discussed his faith and said he was a Christian. 'I would sit in church and always wonder, \"In God\u2019s eyes, how does he see me?\"' he said. 'Maybe this is my cause in life.' His remarks came in the Friday night interview in which Jenner  revealed that he identifies as a woman - his 'true self' and a childhood dream - in an explosive ABC interview with Diane Sawyer. The 65-year-old Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star sparked rumors about his gender identity last year after visibly altering his appearance. And last night, he confirmed that he is reinventing himself physically in a bid to transition from male to female in the highly-anticipated, intimate sit-down. Speaking in front of millions of viewers, including Kim Kardashian and her family, Bruce tearfully revealed: 'For all intents and purposes, I am a woman. Christian: Jenner also said that he is a Christian and wondered whether transitioning to a woman was his cause in life . 'My brain is much more female than it is male. That's what my soul is. Bruce lives a lie. She is not a lie.' He firmly added: 'I can't do it anymore.' During the interview, Bruce also admitted that he has been regularly taking female hormones - and plans to completely transform into a woman. But he said he was still attracted to females. 'I was never attracted to the guys,' he told Diane, explaining how he has always enjoyed a good sex life. And he denied that his revelations were for publicity purposes. Instead, he made them due to his inability to continue to 'pull the curtain', he said. Indeed, hiding his identity was so painful for Bruce that it once left him contemplating suicide to escape from the never-ending scrutiny, he revealed. Many viewers and celebrities were taking to social media last night to congratulate Bruce on making a giant leap for the transgender community. Lady Gaga tweeted: '#BruceJennerABC Now that is bravery', before telling her fans to 'empower people like Bruce' globally by 'being loving & not mean'. Meanwhile, Bruce's 17-year-old daughter, Kylie Jenner, tweeted an emotional message to her father. 'Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave. My beautiful Hero,' she wrote.",

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Last year: Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt last November \u00a0after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game against Hiram University . Never give up: Lauren, picture on March 22, is vowing to never give up her battle with rare brain cancer .

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)From banking to hospitality and real estate to e-commerce, Ashish Thakkar built his vast business empire from scratch. The Ugandan tycoon started small with a little computer shop that kept him busy after leaving school at 15. These days, his Mara Group spans over 20 countries and he's been called \"Africa's youngest billionaire.\" In late 2013 Thakkar joined forces with the former boss of Barclays bank -- Bob Diamond -- to start an investment fund focused on Africa called Atlas Mara. The powerful duo raised $325 million through a share flotation - well above the $250 million target. But his vision spans beyond Africa, and Earth -- Thakkar was the first African to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic. CNN's Marketplace Africa spoke to Thakkar about African innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN:  You are active in several African countries. How is the current business landscape on the continent? Ashish Thakkar: Right now in the last 18 years I have been active on the continent, I have never seen so much global excitement around Africa that I've seen today. The climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved. Unfortunately, it's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality. The reality on the ground is so much better than the perception. You've got to remember, as Africa, we are 54 countries. Some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues, but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit. CNN: Why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the African continent? AT: We have a very young demographic -- 85% of our populations are under the age of 35. We have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture. Yet, entrepreneurship is not in the education system. Where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance? And it's something, frankly, that I am extremely passionate about, because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants, etc. It's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises. So, it's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system, and innovation is totally embedded into that. CNN: What is it about Africa that encourages innovation? AT: The biggest advantage we have at the moment, and you've seen this with mobile phone penetration, is that we don't have legacy systems. We didn't have landlines and we didn't need them. We didn't have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere. We leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony. Today, we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than North America and Western Europe put together. We can actually leapfrog in so many different ways. Mobile money is another brilliant example. Mobile money was created in Kenya. The whole concept of having money on your phone, which is the best thing because it's secure, it's practical, made more sense. So, these kind of innovations, you're going to see a lot more of on the continent. I spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when I travel across the continent, and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they're coming up with is just so inspiring. CNN: What advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who's just starting out? AT: Entrepreneurship is a journey, it's not a destination. There are going to be so many challenges, you are going to get knocked down so many times, but you've got to get up, dust yourself off and get back to it. The persistence, the passion, and staying on course is very crucial. You'll be tempted to cut corners, you'll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker, but it never lasts. People say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we're not. We're the leaders of today, but it's our responsibility to take the seat at the table. CNN: What needs to be done most urgently to grow African economies? AT: Pan-African collaboration is extremely important. I think things like regional integration, inter-African trade does need to increase and is increasing. I mean, the progress in the East African community has been amazing. The manner in which they've harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic. So, we need to see more of that take place on the continent. The fact that we're 54 countries, yet we're a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage. I think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial. CNN: Are you confident about the future of the continent? AT: I am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership, the mindset of our leaders. It is so inspiring to see that. It's unfortunate that, you know, globally the highlight remains things like Ebola...The little issues that we do have are just magnified, yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing. CNN: Is this Africa's century? AT: Mara's logo is the African Lion and our little joke, which a lot of people don't appreciate, hence I love it even more, is that the Indian Tiger and the Chinese Dragon have had their days and it's now the African Lion's turn. And it genuinely is -- this is our turn. More from Marketplace Africa . Read this: Africa's green lean speed machines . Read this: Family ties mixed with fresh fruit on island paradise .

Jessa, 22, and her 19-year-old husband Ben   announced the\u00a0the news of their pregnancy ina video for\u00a0TLC.com, which featured them both\u00a0making health smoothies, and Jessa has revealed that one of the first things the couple considered after hearing the news was how to adjust her workouts accordingly, to ensure that she can remain fit and active while expecting. Speaking to People magazine, the reality star explained that when it comes to exercising: 'I'm just trying not to overdo it right now. I am still working out, but not trying to break any records. Scroll down for video . Expecting: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald recently revealed that she is pregnant with their first child . Announcement: The baby is due on November 1, which is also the date of Ben and Jessa's first wedding anniversary . 'I want to gain a little less weight and not stress out about it. I do want to make sure that I'm eating healthy. You are eating for two but the other is, like, a speck. I am trying to make healthy choices now that I'm entering my second trimester.' The pair, who married after a chaste courtship, are well-known for their health-conscious lifestyle and are often seen on the Duggars\u2019 hit reality series enjoying healthy dinners or working out together, something which viewers saw frequently during the build-up to the couple\u2019s wedding, during which time Jessa was incredibly keen to trim down her already-toned physique. A recent episode of the show even saw Jessa pushing Ben's truck down the road while wearing workout pants covered with knee-length skirts to maintain their 'standard of modesty'. Jessa also frequently posts recipes and photos of healthy foods she's trying out on Instagram. Juiced up: Jessa and Ben are both champions of healthy eating, and even announced their pregnancy in an adorable video while making smoothies . Push it along: While getting ready for her wedding, Jessa stepped up her workout, part of which involved pushing her fiance's truck down a dirt road with her siblings inside . Interesting attire: The women in the religious Duggar family wear skirts over their workout pants to maintain their 'standard of modesty' As for her pregnancy diet, when Jessa discovered the news, she said that she thought she would take after other Duggar mothers when it came to her pregnancy cravings, but admitted that this hasn\u2019t been the case. 'I am feeling pretty good,' she added to People. 'I thought I'd crave pickles and lemons because my mother did, but I couldn't stand them. 'I'm hoping I'm having triplets because I've been eating so much!' However, Jessa does admit she will be looking to her older sister Jill for advice, as the 23-year-old just welcomed a son Israel with husband Derick Dillard on April 6, and is also a trained midwife. Jill kept up her exercise during the later months of pregnancy by\u00a0walking on the treadmill while listening to sermons. 70 hours later: Jessa's sister Jill Dillard (pictured) welcomed her son Israel on April 6 with her husband Derick after almost three full days of labor . Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c) Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.",

Despite its secluded location it is home to the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy,\u00a0the world's largest Buddhist settlement. A vibrant splash of red, this colourful settlement has sprung up in the 1980s and is now a haven for over 40,000 monks and nuns. Larung Gar Buddhist Academy is home to 40,000 monks and nuns, who travel to the settlement of\u00a0Sertar to study Tibetan Buddhism . The red and brown houses are nearly identical, with one to three rooms per hut and no heating or toilets installed . The settlement is home to 40,000 nuns and monks, who flock to study, attend lectures and dwell in the mountains . Local children gather after class on one of the banks in the hilly religious institution. Monks and nuns are segregated by a winding road . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study at the remote dwelling. The wooden huts are built so closely together, they look like a red sea spreading up the hilly terrain. Nuns and monks are housed near to their colleges, and separated by age and sex. The segregation of male and female living quarters is marked by a winding road, which weaves through the dense mass of huts. All monks and nuns live close to the college but are housed in different district according the age and sex of students . Prayer forms an important part in the life of the monks who travel from multiple countries to attend lectures and classes in the area . Sky burials are common in the province of Tibet and involve corpses being cut and left for animals to devour. The human bodies are placed on mountaintops in order for the elements or predatory animals, typically vultures, to prey upon it. The majority of Tibetans and many Mongolians adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits. They believe after death the body is an empty vessel and there is no need to preserve it. By allowing nature or animals to take command of the body, they are disposing of the remains in the most generous way. In many areas of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and, due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical. Conditions are basic, with residents having to share communal toilets, and each unheated hut ranging from one to three rooms in size. An isolated religious haven, Sertar is located around 370 miles from Chengdu, and those wishing to visit have to travel by coach for a gruelling 20 hours. TVs are prohibited at the picturesque retreat, with monks and nuns flocking to benefit from the studies, prayers and lectures ran at the academy. The settlement has grown from a handful of disciples in the 1980s to become one of the largest centres for the study of Tibetan Buddhism . Prayer is undertaken by spinning the decorative prayer wheels which are located around the Buddhist settlement . Monks study after their lessons. Visitors are welcomed into the monastery to learn and witness the classes . Monks pray inside the biggest temple of the town. Inside, children and adults gather on the floor to sing songs . Photographer Wanson Luk journeyed to the secluded location from Chengdu on a 20-hour bumpy coach ride. The 34-year-old Buddhist said the Larung Area has two small guest houses, but as these were occupied, he had to stay near the entrance. He stayed two days at the Buddhist centre, taking part in ceremonies. Luk said that the settlement welcomes everyone, and they maintain their life in the hills from donations and by small businesses like the guest house or small grocery store. Sertar attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia . Tibetan monks, also known as lamas, are pictured at a grocery in the Serthar Buddhist Institute in China . 'I was most surprised about how people feel about death,' Luk said. 'I took part in the sky burial ceremony where there were hundreds or thousands of condors waiting quietly.\u00a0There were 7 corpses on that day...one of them was a child. 'During the ceremony a monk will pray then the \"sky burial master\" will start cutting the corpses.\u00a0When he is done, the condors will all fly to the corpses . 'They believe the more the condors eat, the better it is and they will not eat bad people's body.' Nuns travel to school by walking down the steep verges which can peak at nearly three miles high . Snow covers the surrounding hills of the\u00a0Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, where conditions can be bleak in the winter months . The resplendent Buddhist monastery is the focal feature of the academy, with a wall to prevent monks and nuns from mingling . At the peak close to the town, monks tie colourful prayer flags as a practical sign of their religious devotion . One encounter which struck a chord for Luk was the meeting of a nun who was on her 'no speech day'. When the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist. She ended up taking him around the whole monastery, showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray. Although TVs are prohibited in the monastery, iPhones strangely are permitted, with her typing words to instruct him as they went. At night the view of the Serthar Buddhist Institute is magical, with thousands of little lights illuminating the rolling hills . The settlement is also home to a number of Tibetan people who share the land with the monks and nuns . Prayer stones decorate the colourful Buddhist academy, which is only accessible by a long coach journey . Tibetan nuns, also known as lamas, are pictured on a street in the Serthar Buddhist Institute . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study here . Many of the Buddhists own second-hand  iPhone 4s. The incredible academy was established in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by Jigme Phuntsok, an influential lama of the Nyingma tradition. Despite its remote situation, Larung Gar evolved from a handful of disciples to be the largest Buddhist settlement in the world. It attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, who attend separate classes taught in Mandarin, while larger classes are taught in Tibetan.",

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members \u2013 something that anyone can become by joining free \u2013 while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team.

His views were echoed, more robustly, by commentators and fans alike. That might not be the end of the short-term Kiwi exodus, despite Jerome Kaino\u2019s decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the Lions in 2017. Charles Piutau rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast . Fly-half Colin Slade is thought to be deciding between a move to Toulon or Pau in France \u2013 while the latter club have already landed Conrad Smith. The prospect of piles of Euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the Top 14 league the destination du jour, for southern stars seeking a stint abroad. What makes the Piutau deal so eye-catching is that it is a bold endorsement of Ulster\u2019s ambition and also a boost to the wider Celtic game, below Test level. That boost is much-needed, because there are simmering problems \u2013 as exposed and bemoaned by Leinster\u2019s head coach Matt O\u2019Connor last weekend. The Australian was infuriated by the softly-softly stance of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose final say on release of Test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the Pro 12 clash with leaders Glasgow. Alun Wyn Jones can put his body on the line for\u00a0Ospreys and Wales . \u2018It hurts the league,\u2019 said the Australian, which is absolutely true. The Pro 12 has a credibility issue, due to the continuing absence of so many Irish stars from so many matches. While player welfare is quite rightly prioritised, there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions. No wonder the Welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the Aviva Premiership clubs during the European rebellion last year. A leading figure such as Alun Wyn Jones gives body and soul to the Ospreys week after week, but still found the energy to face down the more rested Irish in Cardiff during the Six Nations. He and so many others in Wales would enhance the Premiership. If the Irish cannot fully commit to a league \u2013 making it a fitting stage for Piutau\u2019s class \u2013 they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for European combat with their provinces. Scrap the LV Cup and bring the regions into an expanded Premiership. Job done. Wasps forward Hughes\u00a0was clumsy, not reckless . Wasps players were incensed by the three-game ban handed to their No 8, Nathan Hughes, for the collision which left George North unconscious last Friday night, and their angst is understandable. The big Fijian was clumsy, but no more, by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the Lions wing, as he scored a try. Nathan Hughes\u00a0was clumsy rather than\u00a0reckless and didn't deserve a three-game ban . The disciplinary panel called the offence \u2018reckless\u2019 and the reaction of Wasps captain James Haskell was priceless. \u2018Rugby is reckless,\u2019 he said. \u2018The whole game is reckless. If you\u2019re going to worry about that\u2026 maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch.\u2019 The England flanker had a point. The sport is founded on physicality and danger. A player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated, damaging contact, however accidental, but the suspicion lingers that Hughes is serving a ban because North was knocked out. If the scorer had jumped up and walked off, it\u2019s fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed. Fill World Cup seats or face fan fury . Is anyone really surprised that trying to buy World Cup tickets is such a drawn-out ordeal? For those without the benefit of a corporate invite (or a media pass, before anyone pipes up), securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of root-canal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket. The Webb Ellis Cup visits a school in Toronto as part of the Rugby World Cup Trophy Tour . We are in the cost-cutting age of do-it-all-online, so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on Monday. At least the old-fashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit, as so wonderfully evident at Wimbledon tennis down the years. Ultimately, the World Cup will be a sell-out, but organisers better be right when they say there won\u2019t be the empty seats which blighted the Olympics. As if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough, those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of well-heeled \u2018guests\u2019 can\u2019t be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena, or even turn up at all. Signing Sinfield is an inspired move . It\u2019s been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt, which is harsh on all concerned. Kevin Sinfield is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in Leeds later this year, from the Rhinos to Yorkshire Carnegie. Yorkshire Carnegie's signing of rugby league legend\u00a0Kevin Sinfield is a statement of intent . He wants to play fly-half and while the prospect of him igniting the Championship at the age of 34 is far-fetched, he is a proven leader and winner, and his mentality is what the union side at Headingley are keen to tap into. No doubt, he\u2019ll bring a few more through the turnstiles, too, but coach Bryan Redpath will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him. It is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation, Leeds are another second-tier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile. Last Word . Team GB, under the auspices of England, face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the Olympic Sevens tournament in Rio. In Hong Kong last weekend, Simon Amor\u2019s side \u2013 nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of Great Britain, ahead of Wales and Scotland \u2013 lost further ground to Australia and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings, one below the final qualification slot. This weekend in Tokyo, they must try to catch their rivals from Down Under, but they have been drawn in a pool with Fiji, who won in Hong Kong and are second in the rankings behind South Africa. Realistically, one Olympic place is up for grabs, behind those nations and New Zealand, and England\u2019s advantage is that the series culminates at Twickenham next month. Sadly, Team GB\u2019s preparations \u2013 complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby \u2013 have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight, and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting.",

Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of V\u00e1c in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Ter\u00e9zia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by \u2018new\u2019 diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of V\u00e1c's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria\u00a0Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second\u2013fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in\u00a0V\u00e1c in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'",

Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, was arrested after he burst into\u00a0Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham wielding an axe and demanding cash, as an accomplice stood at the door. But he was foiled after shopkeeper Sab Dhillon heard McKarry's demands and ran from the back of the shop and rugby tackled him to the floor. Mr Dhillon's wife then appeared clutching her son's baseball bat and managed to subdue him further. Scroll down for video . Prolific thief Shaun Andrew McKerry was once dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' because he always returned home after his many crimes, and he has been unmasked as the axe wielding thief in an attempted post office robbery - where he was subdued by the owner who rugby tackled him and his wife with a baseball bat (left) McKerry was dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' in the 1990s after he was arrested\u00a080 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998. He got his nickname because he always returned home after his crimes. He committed his first offence at the age of 11 and in the next five years went on to commit 1,000 crimes. His own mother even previously pleaded for her teenage son, known as a one man crime wave, to be locked up. McKerry pleaded guilty\u00a0at Durham Crown Court, via videolink from prison, to attempted robbery from the post office on March 15. CCTV footage of the incident shows the 31-year-old burst into the store and demand\u00a0terrified assistant Andrea Brighty fill his bag with money. But Mr Dhillon heard the incident and ran from the back of the store to pounce on McKerry. After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat. McKerry is pictured in handcuffs at the age of 15 when he was committing strings of offences in the area . As Mr Dhillon held him, the shop assistant removed McKerry's scarf so his face could be shown to the cameras. His accomplice, who had been standing guard at the door when they burst in, fled. Mrs Dhillon said: 'It was really scary. We didn't realise who he was at the time and how bad his previous convictions were.' Her husband told the Northern Echo: 'He did not hit me but there was a good chance that he could have as he was waving the axe about blindly while he was on the floor. Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor . 'I am OK and we're trying to get over it and we just want to put this behind us.' McKerry, who will be sentenced on April 24, is known by the nickname 'Boomerang Boy' or 'Homing Pigeon Boy' because he always returned home after his crimes. He once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His catalogue of offending included car chases with police, a string of burglary convictions, aggravated vehicle taking, sending indecent letters, witness intimidation, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and countless breaches of curfew, community sentences and offending while on bail. CCTV images show Mr Dhillon pouncing on 31-year-old McKerry, armed with an axe, from behind . Mr Dhillon and the terrified shop assistant (right) subdued McKerry and revealed his face for the cameras . Mr Dhillon tackled McKerry and both he and his wife said they did not realise his criminal history at the time . McKerry's case was even brought to the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair, who later announced a crackdown on so called 'bail-bandits'. He began offending from the age of 11, and has clocked up dozens of court appearances. On March 11, 1999, McKerry, of County Durham, had already been arrested five times between January 22 and February 10. Shaun Andrew McKerry started offending at the age of 11 when he committed his first theft in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000 he clocked up 1,000 offences. In the 12 months of 1995 he was arrested 80 times. McKerry managed to stay out of prison for 36 weeks in 1998, and was arrested 45 times. He was arrested five times between January 22 and February 10, 1999. McKerry became known as a one man crime wave and was dubbed Boomerang Boy because he always returned home, police knowing where to find him. His mother even called for her teenage son to be arrested. In 1999 she said: 'I love him as a son but I hate the person he has become.' In one of his earlier crimes McKerry  stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman. By the age of 15 McKerry had\u00a0convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. When he was 16 McKerry was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for\u00a0robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. At the age of 18 he was out of prison and had offended again, but was given a 'second chance' by magistrates. Just three days later he was back again. From then on he stuck to low level crimes to feed his drug habit. In 2011 he was jailed for four years after he admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. In March he was rugby tackled and restrained by Sab Dhillon when he went into the store, armed with an axe and demanded cash. He has 55 previous convictions. He boasted after one court appearance he would be back and returned just 48 hours later on suspicion of taking a car. The 15-year-old was then placed on a supervision order despite a report to magistrates that he was a danger to the public. Magistrates tried to provide him with a string of second chances and opportunities to rehabilitate himself - but each time he re-offended. In February 2000 the press won a landmark legal victory to name him when the Lord Chief Justice ruled Bishop Auckland Youth Court had done nothing legally wrong when it agreed to the paper's application to lift the juvenile's automatic right to anonymity. Lord Bingham said he had taken a great interest in the case which centred on the individual youth's right to freedom and anonymity against the public's right to be better protected by knowing his identity. As he continued to offend McKerry developed a drug problem and stole to feed his habit. Six months later McKerry, then 16, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. This was later cut on appeal but by March 2002, aged 18, he was back behind bars again after admitting two new offences - three days after being given yet another 'last chance' by magistrates. McKerry had been granted bail after admitting theft on a Monday but was picked up 48 hours later after helping raid a Bishop Auckland clothing shop. In 2002 his mother Paula Harp, 32, pleaded for him to be arrested after she said he had ruined her life. She claimed he started to offend because he was a bit of a loner, and began doing minor things like throwing stones before his behaviour escalated. In recent years, much of his offending has been for the theft of low value items, from shops in the south-west Durham area. But in May, 2011 he was jailed for four years at Durham Crown Court which heard he only had 18 months to live if his drug and alcohol abuse continued. McKerry admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. His lawyer said he had deep vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver, as a result of years of substance abuse. The court heard he had 55 previous convictions for 120 offences.",

David Hibbitt, 33, was diagnosed with the disease in July 2012 and underwent\u00a0chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery to remove his large bowel. Doctors told him the cancer was terminal - so he decided to try cannabis oil as a last resort and bought it from a local dealer for \u00a350 a gram. Now the father-of-one says he has been cancer-free since his last scan in January \u00a0- and puts the class-B drug down to his miracle recovery. David Hibbitt, 33, claims doctors said he had between 18 months and five years to live after being diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. In desperation, he tried cannabis oil, which he now credits with his recovery . He is now looking forward to the future after tying the knot with his partner of six years Heather Martin, 26, at a registry office today. Mr Hibbitt, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Friends had told me about cannabis oil and I dismissed it at first. I've never been into drugs. 'But in February last year I was told I only had 18 months to five years to live, and I felt I had to try everything I could. 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die.' After going online to research his options, he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it. 'I pay around \u00a350 for a gram from a bloke I know who makes it,' he said. 'That lasts me about a month usually. 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy. 'The pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job. 'I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there.' Mr Hibbitt was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer after initially being told he was suffering from piles. Mr Hibbitt, with fiance Heather, said: 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die' After undergoing treatment at the Christie Hospital, in Manchester, the cancer returned and he had another operation in July 2013 followed by more chemotherapy. He was given the all-clear before Christmas that year, but a month later he found a lump, and was told the cancer was in the lymph nodes in his groin. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn't good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'Researchers are collecting patients' experiences to build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabinoid-based drugs in order to gather solid data on whether they benefit people with cancer.' Mr Hibbitt, who works in advertising, added: 'This time they told me there wasn't a lot they could do. 'In July, after doing a lot of research, I got some cannabis oil. I was having chemo, and I was getting to a point where I couldn't really do much, I had no energy. 'In August I decided I'd had enough and I was going to stop the chemotherapy. In October, he had an operation to remove the affected lymph nodes at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. But he chose to carry on taking cannabis oil rather than have any more treatment, deciding against further chemotherapy sessions. Following a scan in January he was given the all-clear - paving the way for him to organise his wedding. Mr Hibbitt, who has a five-year-old son, Ashton, said: 'We never thought this would happen, it's great. Fingers crossed now I will grow old. 'I feel really good and I hope my story will help other people.' His fiance Heather, a nursery nurse, said: 'I didn't want him to take the cannabis oil at first because it's illegal, but I saw the change in him and slowly got used to it. 'He is a determined person and did a lot of research. He wanted to live. 'We are all amazed how well he's done. I can't see my life without him. We have come through a hell of a lot.' Describing the effects of cannabis oil, he said: 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy.The pain just seemed to disappear. I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there' Cancer Research UK says it is aware of patients using cannabis extracts to treat themselves but stressed there is 'no good evidence'  to prove it was safe and effective. The charity is supporting clinical trials into the use of the drug and a synthetic cannabinoid to treat the disease. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours.

Scroll down and you'll eventually find your first female face: none other than Barbie, 'CEO Barbie' to be precise, a doll which first appeared in the Eighties, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase. The image of Barbie is the 96th result on the page, and ironically comes from a 2005 spoof article courtesy of The Onion that jokingly states 'women don't run companies'. Spot the stereotype! Barbie is the 96th image to come up on Google Images when you enter the search term 'CEO', after rows and rows of grinning suit-clad men . Several high-powered women, including women's right campaigner Chelsea Clinton, have re-tweeted the results of the search, which is being seen by many as a sad reflection on the general state of women in the workplace. Google, like other search engines, generates images based on a knot of complex algorithms related to file names and key words. The more 'popular' and relevant an image is, the higher up the ranks it will move. After Barbie, the next female - and the first human one - you'll find upon searching Google Images for 'CEO' doesn't pop up until several lines more of men, and is Jessica Herrin, CEO of a jewellery company called Stella & Dot. Incidentally, a new study from the University of Washington recently found that results like these are indeed contributing to gender bias, and perpetuating outdated views on women in the workplace. Shining example? The image (pictured) is of 'CEO Barbie', a doll which first appeared in the 80s, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase . Noted: Chelsea Clinton was one of the many high-powered women to retweet the results of the search . The study concluded: 'Manipulated image search results could determine, on average, seven per cent of a study participant\u2019s subsequent opinion about how many men and women work in a particular field.' Earlier this year, it was determined by the Professional Boards Forum\u2019s BoardWatch that for the first time ever, the proportion of women on FTSE 500 boards in the UK had reached 20 per cent. Of the images returned by Google from a 'CEO' search, only 11 per cent were of women.

But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna\u2019s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair\u2019s popularity. Brookstein\u2019s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It\u2019s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair\u2019s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: \u2018Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.\u2019 Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned \u00a3303,000 in addition to his MP\u2019s salary, mostly from \u00a31,600-an-hour appearances on Iran\u2019s Press TV and Russia Today. The national treasure that is Andrew Marr gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign. \u2018There\u2019s this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life. To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,\u2019 he writes in The Spectator. \u2018They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don\u2019t want to talk about taxation. \u2018The deficit? Apparently if it\u2019s left alone it\u2019s just going to melt away. Huddled-down, risk-averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children.\u2019 Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's 'Controls On Immigration' mug embarrassing . Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour\u2019s embarrassing \u2018Controls On Immigration\u2019 mug at the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in her Sky News interview yesterday. Cooper coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras. \u2018A storm in a coffee cup,\u2019 Cooper, aka Mrs Ed Balls, said. The influential Labour Uncut blog says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon\u2019s claim that Red Ed Miliband \u2018stabbed his own brother in the back\u2019 to lead Labour, and would do the same to Britain by negotiating away Trident, will help the Tories. \u2018The manner in which Ed Miliband defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with Labour canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of Ed Miliband as an untrustworthy leader,\u2019 the website says. \u2018The gutter is an ugly place to be but. . . it\u2019s where elections are won.\u2019 Plaid Cymru is under pressure to dump its candidate for Ceredigion, Mike Parker, for saying in 2001 English-born inhabitants of rural Wales were \u2018gun-toting final solution crackpots\u2019.

The 'Cripmas' party, held last December, had white students throwing stereotypical gang symbols while dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and fake 'thug' tattoos. The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities. Photos from the party flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity at Clemson University in South Carolina has been put on probation for two years after the group held a Christmas theme party that flared up racial tensions on campus . Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting last December's frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes . The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California. The incident caused a backlash as black students protested and said Clemson didn't do enough to promote racial tolerance. About 6 percent of Clemson's students are black. All SAE activity was suspended by Clemson indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party. Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation found that the fraternity violated alcohol rules and student conduct codes. It will be on probation until February 2017. Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students last December making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and that such events would not be tolerated. White students dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and sported fake 'thug' tattoos . Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year \u2013 all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night's ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this. He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. 'But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.' A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was disbanded last month after members were taped singing a racist song.

Her food allergies change so frequently, keeping track is almost pointless. It was just another day with another massive allergic reaction. She can always tell when one is coming on. \"I just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom.\" Her labradoodle, Moose, starts alerting, licking her hands frantically. \"I'll feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach, and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling. And we have to treat it really fast.\" On that particular day in March, multiple EpiPens didn't slow the reaction. The paramedics who arrived to take Brynn to Greenville Memorial Hospital, or \"Hotel Greenville\" as she likes to call it, knew her well. When she asked for her security blanket, they knew to hand her her smartphone. \"New day, new crisis,\" Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong. It might as well be. When you're allergic to life, a near-death experience is no big deal. Less than a week after her trip to the hospital, Brynn, 21, is back at home in Easley, South Carolina. She lies on her back, her head near the foot of her bed, chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port. Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. The disinfectant burns, and Brynn's blood pressure hits 150/102. Her heart rate rockets to 128. \"The meds we have to give her to keep her alive, she reacts to,\" Melissa says, shaking her head. \"Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. \" Brynn was seemingly a normal kid -- until she wasn't. Yes, she was a fussy baby. Yes, she got sick often as a child, Melissa muses out loud -- but what kid doesn't? Brynn was also incredibly energetic, always the center of attention. Her father, Barry, jokingly rues the day she learned to talk. She started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11. That was the same year doctors diagnosed Brynn with IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. \"She's always been --\" Melissa Duncan pauses. \"High maintenance!\" Brynn fills in with a laugh. It wasn't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that Brynn had her first serious allergic reaction. The next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors' appointments. Brynn saw specialist after specialist. The gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis, or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles. A cardiologist said she had POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes, her blood pressure dropped, leaving her light-headed and nauseated. A Wake Forest doctor diagnosed her with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints. After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. They found a specialist online, Dr. Lawrence Afrin, who at the time was working in Charleston. They waited nearly nine months to see him, but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life-changing. Scientists don't know yet what causes mast cell disease. Researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior, but the mutations vary from one patient to the next. Because of this, scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life. But genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations. Mast cells are the regulators of your immune system. They're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites, or when you come into contact with an allergen. They basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong. Until recently, the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis, which is characterized by \"abnormal proliferation and activation\" of the body's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways. But in the last few years doctors such as Afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number. \"It's like I'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction,\" Brynn explains simply. Fruit, vegetables, milk, soy, nuts, smoke, perfume, the sun -- you name it, Brynn is allergic to it. But it's not really about the specifics; the allergens change depending on how \"angry\" her mast cells are that day, she says. On good days, she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes. On bad days, even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain. Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. \"Oh God, no,\" Afrin says when asked. \"No, no, no, no.\" But mast cells are located in your connective tissue, including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine. They can affect every system in the body, Afrin says, so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms Brynn experiences. You have to ask yourself, he says: \"Is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different, independent problems? Or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on?\" Of course, having a diagnosis didn't make living with mast cell disease any easier. In 2012, Brynn was admitted to the hospital 30 times. She started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful, violent muscle contractions that are \"scary to see and scary to experience.\" On multiple occasions, doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction.",

Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was meant to ink 'Riley' - the name of his four-year-old son - into his left arm.

The makeshift tattoo session took place in Mr Moffatt's living room with a \u00a370 ink gun bought online. The NHS worker was drunk at the time and said he now considers the inkwork a 'nightmare'. He said: 'I'd never picked up a tattoo gun in my life and I got told by my brother not to do, but I just didn't listen. 'Now, my family are always saying \"you're an idiot, Tom\" and there are plenty of jokes at my expense from my mates. I can't repeat what they say about it. 'I have to hide my arm when I go for interviews. Even Riley has started to notice and points at those tattoos and says \"daddy, I don't like those ones\". It's a nightmare.' Among his homegrown tattoos, Mr Moffatt also has a wonky cross on his forearm, which he drew just a few months after Riley's birth in 2012. He has just endured his second hour-long laser removal session in a bid to get rid of the botched needlework.

Painful: But because the ink has gone so deep, Mr Moffatt is unsure how many more sessions he needs to have . He said: 'I've got a long journey ahead of me to get them all off and I pressed it so deep in one that it's going to be very difficult to get it off.' Mr Moffatt, who also has a two-year-old daughter Kya with partner Rachael Higgins, 23, now wants to use his experience to highlight why people should not attempt to draw their own tattoos. He said: 'Once I've got them off, my job isn't done. We want to try and get a campaign going so people like me can't just go out and buy a gun with no questions asked. 'You shouldn't be able to go on the internet as a 15-year-old Joe Bloggs and buy one. I want to get the message out there that tattoos should only be done by professionals.' The owner of the Maria Patricia Tattoo Removals, where he is being treated, says Mr Moffatt's situation is a stark warning against the dangers of unregulated ink work. Maria said: 'There needs to be more regulation. People don't realise the dangers of the buying off tattoo guns and ink off the internet. 'Tom did just that and had to Google the instructions of how to use it. It might seem like a laugh with mates when you're drunk but it's not easy to fix the damage and people can be left with scarring if they're not careful. 'We're all for tattoos but people need to be aware they can wreck lives and make it difficult to get jobs.' Mr Moffatt, a machine operator working on NHS hospital equipment,\u00a0will appear in Tattoo Disasters UK, which airs each Tuesday, new and exclusive to Spike.",

The 39-year-old was on the ninth hole when he found himself 470 yards away from the pin with the ball nestled in pine straws. However when he followed through, the four-time champion at Augusta slammed the club into a root, causing him to wince and grab his hand in agony. It forced the joint out of place, but Woods shunned medical attention and simply pushed it back in himself. Tiger Woods looks in agony after his club came into contact with a tree root on the ninth hole at Augusta. He later revealed his wrist bone had 'popped out' of place . The 39-year-old is clearly in agony as he is forced to drop his club on the follow through . He then grabs his wrist and winces. After finishing his round he revealed that his wrist bone had popped out - so he was forced to put it back in . His reaction prompted concerns he may have suffered another injury setback. However he managed to shake off the scare and finish his round. Woods, playing in his 20th Masters tournament, ended up at 5-under-par on 283, tied for 17th. 'It hurts; it definitely hurts,' Woods said. 'I didn't know there was a tree root there. I drilled the club straight into it. It didn't move, but my body kept moving. 'There's a little joint that popped out, and I was able to somehow put it back in, which didn't feel very good. 'At least I got it back in; I could move my hand again. It's sore. I'm not going to be lifting any weights for a while.' He also admitted that he may not return to the course for a while. Despite finishing\u00a013 strokes behind 21-year-old winner Jordan Spieth, this was Woods' best finish in a tournament in over a year. Spieth became the youngest winner since Woods when he was given the coveted green jacket on Sunday. After his final putt he went an embraced his tearful childhood sweetheart Annie Verret. The Texan native, whose life-long dream has been to win the Masters, was undoubtedly being watched on television at home by his youngest sibling, Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Ellie has helped to keep Spieth grounded, according to their mother. Speaking after his win, Spieth said: 'It was very nerve-wracking today. I didn't sleep all last night. Just got out here and got in a little rhythm. With two major champions right behind, I couldn't let up. It was the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It was remarkable. He added: 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green there, and knew it was going to be a done deal. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit.' Spieth's victory comes a year after he lost a bid to become the youngest player to win the Masters. This year, he did not let anyone get closer to him than three shots following his record start. He closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set another record. The four-time Masters champion managed to shake off the injury to finish the competition at 5-under-par . 21-year-old Jordan Spieth (centre) celebrates his first Masters victory with his girlfriend Annie Verret on Sunday .

The former Motherwell manager admitted being wowed by Murray Park in the days after he replaced Kenny McDowall. The club's \u00a312million training facility is a major improvement on the public pitches at Dalziel Park he was forced to make do with during his Steelmen stint. Stuart McCall insists he's loving life at Rangers despite losing heavily to Queen of the South . But along with the plush surroundings, McCall knows being manager of the Glasgow giants means he also has to cope with the kind of intense scrutiny levels he did not have to deal with at Fir Park. Not everyone is cut out for the strains of the job, as McDowall proved when he quit after posting just three wins from his 10-game spell as caretaker. The former Celtic youth coach found himself in charge just as the battle for power at Ibrox reached its bitterest point and at one stage admitted life at Rangers had 'taken its toll' on him. McCall has taken over a brighter picture following Dave King's boardroom victory and the 50-year-old former Light Blues midfielder seemed to shrug off the extra pressure during his first few weeks in charge as he led his side to three successive wins - including successes against Hearts and Hibs. Lewis Kidd (left) battles for the ball against Rangers' David Templeton in Queen of the South's victory . But the focus will have sharpened since Gers suffered their first defeat under his watch when they lost 3-0 to Queen of the South on Thursday. The Ibrox men will hope to shake that off come Sunday when they host Raith Rovers but McCall insists he will not let the job wear him down. He said: 'I've not really noticed a difference in intensity levels. I just love what I do out there on the training field. 'At this moment in time I don't feel any pressure whatsoever. Ian Black (left) and Kris Boyd in training as Rangers look to get back to winning ways and gain promotion . 'I'm in a fortunate position to be doing the job I'm doing at this moment and I'm looking forward to being successful. 'I said from day one that this can still be a successful season for the club and we have got to grab the opportunity with both hands. 'I don't give the demands of working for a club like this much thought. 'Football management is tough, no matter what level you do it at. 'Obviously there is more scrutiny when you are at a club that has the following we've got. But that's part and parcel of being a manager. You just have to get on with it.'",

Instead, Broskey, formerly a real estate agent, has taken a job with Uber, hoping to make enough money in what time he has left to pay off his mortgage so his daughter and two grandchildren can continue to live in his house. Scroll down for video . Ken Broskey (above) has stage 4 cancer, and has taken a job as an Uber driver . This so he can\u00a0earn money to pay off his mortgage before he dies so his daughter and grandchildren (above) can have his house . Now he is getting a little help too from Uber after they heard about his story. The company has donated $5,000 to the man, and is also donating $1 to a GoFundMe campaign set up for the man for every rider who enters UberPartnerKen into their app when requesting a car before Monday. This is all thanks to the work of Roland Gainer, a college student who started a campaign to help Broskey after riding in the man's car. 'His situation reminded me of the helplessness I felt watching my mother battle (but beat) cancer when I was in high school,' writes Gainer on the aforementioned GoFundMe page he set up for Broskey. And in just a few days, the fundraiser has almost reached its $95,000 goal.

'We can, however, using our relationships and resources help to give him peace\u2014and his family their home- in his final days.' It is not just the money either, as Boskey and Gainer also seem to have forged a true friendship. Says Gainer; 'My unlikely friendship with Ken has defied age, race, geographic, and economic boundaries and is bound by the common good of mankind.' He then adds; 'But, it won\u2019t defy time.'",

On Thursday, the Inverness defender was cleared to play in the Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk on May 30 after a charge of deliberate handball to deny Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths in last Sunday\u2019s semi-final was thrown out. In the aftermath of the 3-2 extra-time win, Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . His admission \u2013 backed by manager John Hughes \u2013 preceded the player being cited by the SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. That unprecedented move following a game in which a handball incident had gone unpunished, brought a warning from Jim Boyce, head of FIFA\u2019s referees committee, that a successful prosecution would open up a can of worms. Although such a scenario was avoided with the charge being kicked out, the furore surrounding the issue prompted the SFA go public on Friday with the tribunal panel\u2019s reasons. And it seems they accepted the preliminary argument of Inverness\u2019 legal representative that they weren\u2019t entitled to take the matter further. A statement read: \u2018Further to the judicial panel hearing on Friday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings\u2019 solicitor. \u2018In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . \u2018The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. \u2018It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.\u2019 The explanation raises questions as to whether McGlennan ought to have cited Meekings in the first place. Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded against Celtic . However, legal sources have told Sportsmail that the SFA\u2019s prosecutor is entitled to cite players even in such instances when officials have seen an \u2018incident\u2019 but have failed to spot an \u2018offence\u2019. Yet it appears that in Meekings\u2019 case, the panel concurred with his solicitor\u2019s argument that they were not entitled to take the matter further as the match officials had seen the incident. The matter is further confused by the fact that former Hearts striker Ryan Stevenson and ex-Motherwell keeper Darren Randolph were previously banned retrospectively for serious foul play as the referees in question had seen the \u2018incidents\u2019 but missed the \u2018offences\u2019 in question.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)This week, social media heralded as #motheroftheyear Toya Graham, the Baltimore single mom who pulled her son, who was holding a brick, away from the scene of a riot. A video of Graham yanking young Michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral. Many called her a hero: a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence. And yet, wasn't she also promoting violence? Her own reaction, after all, was to yell, curse and hit. \"Why is America celebrating the beating of a black child?\" asked a writer at The Washington Post. Isn't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? Isn't this why rioting happens? I'm not excusing violence in any form. I wish it didn't exist. But Baltimore isn't on fire because of mothers like Graham. In fact, what we need, not only in communities like Baltimore but also in communities around the country, are more mothers like her. Mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence. I don't see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. I don't see her as a hero, either. What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie. As Graham told Anderson Cooper, she'd told Michael the night before not to join in any riots. He swore he wouldn't. But her momma bear sense kicked in, and when she heard that school was closing early, she didn't take the chance that he'd stick to his promise. She went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course. She went there so that she could help him keep his promise. And when she got there and saw he hadn't, as she suspected, she reacted in the way that she knew would, in that moment, be most effective to get him out of there. And that's the key here. It's easy to punish a teenager for acting out, just as it's easy to punish Graham for taking out her frustrations on Michael in a physical way. But Graham's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent. For better or worse, she knows her son. And she knows her community, and her reality. She knows that she's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated, violent moment. And she will do anything to protect her son, including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there. Can we all say that? Toya Graham raises an important point that's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence: Moms have power. The world needs more momma bear types -- mothers who might be willing to put themselves between their child and certain danger. Mothers who are willing to defy the \"expert\" advice telling them that teenagers need the room to make mistakes; that hovering or even trying to anticipate their misbehavior only stunts their development and leads to more misbehavior. Now more than ever, there are exceptions to that rule. Those of us who live in communities that are generally safe can't imagine the level of fear and frustration that must run through the very core of a mother like Graham. We don't all face the same obstacles as the people who live in places like Baltimore. But we all face the same challenges in raising children. Perhaps it's time to recognize that, at least in that sense, we're more alike than we are different.",

Italian authorities have arrested 15 people on suspicion of murdering the Christians at sea, police in Palermo, Sicily, said. Why migrants are dying to get to Italy . The original group of 105 people left Libya on Tuesday in a rubber boat. Sometime during the trip north across the Mediterranean Sea, the alleged assailants -- Muslims from the Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal -- threw the 12 overboard, police said. Other people on the voyage told police that they themselves were spared \"because they strongly opposed the drowning attempt and formed a human chain,\" Palermo police said. The boat was intercepted by an Italian navy vessel, which transferred the passengers to a Panamanian-flagged ship. That ship docked in Palermo on Wednesday, after which the arrests were made, police said. 'I enter Europe or I die': Desperate migrants rescued this week off Italy . The 12 who died were from Nigeria and Ghana, police said. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, often aboard vessels poorly equipped for the trip. Many of them attempt the voyage to flee war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. More than 10,000 people have arrived on Italian shores from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian coast guard. Many die each year while attempting the voyage, often when boats capsized. Last year at least 3,200 died trying to make the trip. Since 2000, according to the International Organization for Migration, almost 22,000 people have died fleeing across the Mediterranean. The IOM reported Thursday the latest boat to sink in trying to make the journey. Only four people survived from the original 45 on board, bringing the estimated death toll so far this year close to a thousand.

Soil underneath a slide at the park in the Toshima ward in the north-east of the Japanese capital, showed radiation readings of up to 480 microsieverts per hour. This is nearly half the recommended annual limit of exposure for a person. Danger: Japanese authorities detected an unusually high level of radiation around playground equipment in this Tokyo park (pictured) Safety: Authorities cordoned off the park after high levels of radiation were detected underneath a slide . It was not immediately clear why radiation levels were so high in the park, which opened two years after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Authorities believe that the radiation could be coming from something buried underneath the park. The playground has now been fenced off with an orange barricade. Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, members of the public should not be exposed to more than 1000 microsieverts per year. Japan has seen heightened concern over radiation since the 2011 failure of a nuclear plant in Fukushima following an earthquake and tsunami, which led to leaks of radioactive water. In the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks. Thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home in areas closest to Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear plant. Elsewhere, a drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office building this week. Clean up: Workers carry away a container after extremely high levels of radiation were detected in the park . Tests: Following two rounds of testing, officials found high levels of radiation on a section of the equipment .",

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Forever 21 Metallic Satin Blazer . Visit site . Missguided Satin Lapel Longline Tuxedo Blazer (now $30) Visit site . Stella McCartney Rhea satin blazer at The Outnet (now $784) Visit site . Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.' It is not known whether Gywneth's two children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, ten, and Moses, nine, will also be taking part in the challenge however, given the limited supply of food featured in her Twitter picture, it is thought the Shakespeare in Love star is going it alone this time around.",

Surveillance cameras caught the thief taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut. Thief: Surveillance cameras caught a thief (left) taking $9,000 out of the account of Kate Sullivan (right) at Chase branches in Commack and Freeport on September 23, 2014 . Sullivan, who had lung cancer, was informed of the fraud while fighting for her life at\u00a0Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She died five days later. The 50-year-old had worked as a marketing executive for fashion designers Kimora Lee Simmons and Diane von Furstenberg. According to CBS New York, the suspect had Sullivan's Social Security number and a signed copy of her driver's license. Other documents she allegedly used were forged. Sullivan's family was, unsurprisingly, horrified by the news. 'I was just pretty violated and felt kind of helpless standing there with my sister and then knowing that there's some woman trying to clear out her bank account while she lays here fighting for her life,' her sister, Sarah Sullivan, told CBS New York. State police say the female suspect then racked up $4,000 in bills after opening four store credit cards in Sullivan's name in New Haven, Connecticut . The thief posed as Sullivan in Chase branches in two Long Island towns. A teller at one of the locations caught the fake documents but the suspect fled before authorities could be called . 'I just want to make sure nobody else goes through what my family's been going through the last couple of months.' In the weeks following Sullivan's death, her sister discovered new store and credit card bills in Sullivan's mail . 'I've had to fax death certificates and affidavits to all of the creditors and fly in to meet with the police and lots of other stuff I didn't need to deal with while I'm mourning my sister's death,' she said. Detectives from New Haven were scheduled to speak with a New York State Police investigator Thursday afternoon, according to city police spokesman Officer David Hartman. Detectives in the New Haven Police Department's Financial Crimes Division were shown a picture of the suspect and none are aware of any connection to open New Haven cases at this time.

The 38-year-old, who now lives in Hong Kong, gave a five-star review of 'amazing' Pushkar, India after attending its camel fair . Originally from Edmond, Oklahoma, Brad and his wife, Jill, are avid travellers \u2013 taking about four \u2018sizeable\u2019 trips every year, in addition to weekend trips to places such as Macau. Posting under the username BradJill, Brad averages nearly two reviews a day and has made more than 66,000 contributions to the website, including 3,355 reviews, 21,000 forum posts and seven videos. He has posted reviews from 394 cities and 46 countries, with a map on his TripAdvisor profile claiming he has travelled more than 600,000 miles and visited a third of the world. A good number of his reviews have been written for attractions in Hong Kong, Macau and London, where Brad and Jill lived for a few years before moving to Asia. Russia is one of the roughly 80 countries the Oklahoma native has visited (pictured: Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia) Brad Reynolds had nothing but good things to write after visiting this Three Rondavels viewing platform in South Africa . Writing critiques has become an almost daily hobby for Brad, with each one taking anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete. While some people collect stamps or create scrapbooks, he gets his kicks from helping fellow travellers and preserving his travel memories. Brad, a director at an English language learning centre, told MailOnline Travel: \u2018We were just like most people and we just lurked on the website for several years before signing up. \u2018Travel is a very important hobby for us and we spend a lot of time researching and we take a lot of notes. When I get back and start writing reviews it becomes more of a daily habit. \u2018Part of reviewing is a little bit selfish for me. I like recording my travel memories. I used to do a travel journal, but that has been replaced by reviews. \u2018What I\u2019m hoping to accomplish with the community is to try to put notes together that help people to make informed decisions on their own to determine if they want to see certain things or eat at a certain restaurant.\u2019 So far Brad Reynolds has given just 12 one-star ('terrible') ratings, and he has handed out five-star reviews to top attractions . Brad, pictured at New Zealand's Franz Josef Glacier, writes an average of nearly two reviews a day, spending up to an hour on each one . This map on Brad Reynolds' TripAdvisor profile claims he has visited 34 per cent of the world and travelled more than 600,000 miles . So far he has given just 12 one-star ('terrible') ratings, including a caf\u00e9 in Thames, New Zealand, which served a \u2018very bad milkshake\u2019 and a Hong Kong burger joint that made a \u2018terrible hamburger served at premium prices\u2019. Brad wrote that the thick chocolate milkshake, priced at NZ$4.50, at Bayon Expresso was 'the single worst milkshake I can remember', describing the 'disgusting' concoction  as a \u2018highly liquid and odd-textured drink\u2019 that was \u2018the polar opposite of thick\u2019. He was just as unforgiving with his review of the HK$100 burger at The Butchers Club, writing that the fast-food favourite was \u2018a disaster\u2019 thanks to a patty that was \u2018devoid of any natural beef juice or flavour\u2019 and \u2018terrible ingredients\u2019. Some of his two-star ('poor') reviews include Speakers' Corner at London's Hyde Park (asking in his review 'How long will places like this remain relevant in the future?') and the New York Stock Exchange ('Have a look at the facade and side entrance and move along'). Brad and Jill are deeply passionate about travelling the world and say they go on holiday 'as much as humanly possible' Writing critiques has become an almost daily hobby for Brad, with each one taking anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete . But Brad has handed out plenty of five-star ratings for everything from London's Tower Bridge and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC to the Berlin Philharmonic and Budapest's Liberty Bridge. And no destination or cafe is off-limits. He has written reviews for a Nando's in London, a Starbucks in Hong Kong and a McDonald's in Dubai, which he gave a 'poor' rating, writing that his Sausage Egg McMuffin was 'quite poor in food quality, even by McDonald\u2019s international standards'. Brad joined TripAdvisor in 2009, but didn\u2019t write his first review until 2010 when he and Jill, a doctor, were touring Saint Petersburg, Russia and were motivated to write a positive review after eating a \u2018delicious\u2019 slice of cheesecake at a restaurant. Despite devoting countless hours to his reviews he hasn\u2019t developed any fatigue. He said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible, but isn\u2019t afraid to give a one-star rating if the hotel, restaurant or attraction wasn\u2019t up to snuff. He also doesn\u2019t regret any of the things he has written, adding: \u2018We don\u2019t do a lot of cheerleading and we try to keep the emotions out of the reviews. Brad estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on the couple's recent two-week holiday in Italy . Brad and his wife, Jill, have travelled to exotic destinations around the world, including\u00a0rice terraces outside Sagada, Philippines . \u2018When I write a review I try to be more objective and informative and highlight the things that will be more important to the people who will visit. \u2018There are times when things fail to meet the expectations I might have of them but I don\u2019t tend to slam them unless it\u2019s a very, very bad experience.\u2019 This spring the couple toured Italy, stopping in Rome, Florence and Venice during their two-week holiday. Brad, who has visited about 80 countries and has lived in Hong Kong for nine years, estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on their experiences at hotels, restaurants, museums, churches and piazzas in Italy. Despite devoting countless hours to his reviews Brad isn't fatigued; he said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible . The number of reviews he writes ultimately depends on the destination. If it\u2019s a big city, he will likely have dozens of places to write about. But when they visited a game reserve in South Africa the review count was low. Brad doesn\u2019t pay much attention to the word count, as the length of each review varies. He said: \u2018If it\u2019s a museum like the British Museum it\u2019s going to be longer with tips and advice for other visitors. If we\u2019re visiting a small pizzeria in Rome the review won\u2019t be so long.\u2019 Brad Reynolds said he used to spend a lot of time writing about his travels in journals, but now writes reviews to preserve his memories .",

He was so big that it took Shepherd John Hendy and a team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, who they've now named Big Ben. Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him, all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs. Big Ben: the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of the average new-born, towering over peers . Proud mum: Jean with huge son Big Ben after a three-hour labour at a Leicestershire farm . Ben isn't the biggest lamb ever born in this country but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered. 'I don't think there was anything unusual about either parent and this is the first time we have bred a lamb as large as this,' she said. 'His mother must have been relieved when it was over.' She added that the farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock. 'This year we had 86 ewes to lamb but no-one expected anyone like him,' she said. 'We are thinking about keeping him as a tup - a breeding ram - to see if he passes on his weight to the lambs he sires.' Almost as big as a person: Ben dwarfs the other 86 ewes born at the same farm this season . Ben's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the UK weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north Wales. He was named The Big One and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild. Last year Goliath was born at a hefty 22lbs 5oz in Wellington in Somerset. The title for the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb was Bruno, nicknamed 'Woooly Lamboth', who was born in Worcestershire in 2009 at a healthy 21lbs. Bruno was spared the chop because of his size as his owner decided to keep him as a pet because he was curious to know just how big he would get. New Zealand is the world's biggest producer of lambs.

Tierney, who joined Bolton from Norwich, was set for a call up to the Republic of Ireland squad prior to his injury. Bolton defender Marc Tierney has been forced to take early retirement following a long-term ankle injury . Tierney started his career at Oldham Athletic in 2003 , rising through the ranks at the club's academy and making 44 appearances for the first-team, before a switch to Shrewsbury Town four years later. He spent another four years at\u00a0Shrewsbury, with one of those a loan spell at Colchester United. He then moved to Colchester permanently before signing for Norwich in 2010, where he was part of the Canaries side that won promotion to the Premier League.

PSG are chasing an unprecedented quadruple, as Laurent Blanc's side also made it to the French Cup final and currently lead Ligue 1. But they will be without Ibrahimovic next week against Barcelona in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals and the Sweden striker will miss also miss four matches of the domestic season after receiving another ban for his criticism of a referee. Ibrahimovic has been in tremendous form recently, scoring a hat trick in the 4-1 win over Saint-Etienne in the French Cup semifinals midweek and has bagged 13 goals in his last seven appearances for club and country. Once again, he was the man of the match at the Stade de France. With David Luiz and Thiago Motta both out with injuries, Serge Aurier returned to the PSG defence while Adrien Rabiot was given a starting role in midfield. In a tight start to the game, PSG created the first chance in the fourth minute when Ibrahimovic collected a long pass in the box following a free kick from Ezequiel Lavezzi, but the Swede was flagged offside. The PSG players celebrate as they are crowned winners of the French League Cup . Sweden international Ibrahimovic opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the first half . The former AC Milan striker jumps for joy after finding the target from the penalty spot . Former Arsenal defender Sebastien\u00a0Squillaci was sent off for the foul that led to the penalty .

But referee Benoit Bastien did point to the spot in the 20th minute when Squillaci brought Lavezzi down, with the former Arsenal player receiving a straight red card for his foul. Second on PSG's all-time top scorers list behind Pedro Pauleta with 104 goals, Ibrahimovic made no mistake from the spot, sending keeper Alphonse Areola the wrong way with a shot in the top left corner. Squillaci's red card forced Bastia coach Ghislain Printant to change his strategy, with Mathieu Peybernes coming in for Danic. The move did not make a big difference as PSG took complete control of the match and overwhelmed Bastia midfield. Ibrahimovic doubled the French champions' lead before half-time to put them firmly in control . The 33-year-old celebrates with team-mate Marquinhos as PSG cruised to victory . Pegged back in their own half, the Corsicans fought back PSG's relentless attacks for 20 minutes but a poor headed clearance from Peybernes fell into Ibrahimovic's path, with the 33-year-old chesting the ball down before unleashing a low shot at the near post to double the lead. PSG continued to apply pressure after the interval and went close in the 48th when Pastore saw his angled shot end just wide at the far post. PSG goalkeeper Nicolas Douchez enjoyed a quiet evening and Florian Marange failed to convert Bastia's first chance in the 56th minute, sending his header just wide.

Bastia tried everything in the closing stages of the game but lacked a cutting edge and were caught on the break when Cavani struck a perfect header at the far post from Aurier's cross to make it 3-0 with 10 minutes remaining. Another PSG counterattack brought another goal in added time, with Cavani curling a shot past Areola from Ibrahimovic's assist as PSG claimed its fifth League Cup. 'The match was over after 20 minutes following the penalty and the sending off,' said Marange. 'We knew the referee would not make us any gift.'",

Alexis Keslar was walking with her sons, Eli and Silas Keslar along the canal bank on Friday when she was distracted and the stroller tragically rolled away from her into the canal. Keslar desperately tried to rescue her sons, but police have said finding a way down the steep banks proved too difficult and she watched helplessly as the strong current swept her children away. Tragedy: The twin 18-month-old boys who died after falling into a Arizona canal this weekend have been identified as brother Eli and Silas Keslar. Pictured above on their first birthday with parents Alexis (left) and Mark Keslar (right) Eli and Silas were pulled from the water one hour later and rushed to hospital where they were pronounced dead. 'No parent should ever have to lose a child, you know, let alone both of them at the same time,' family friend Marlene Gleim told CNN. 'That's what really, really is heartbreaking to me, because those little boys were, you know, meant so much to so many people.' While authorities in the southern Arizona town officially identified the victims, a\u00a0Go Fund Me page was set up for the parents, Mark and Alexis Keslar. Marlene Gleim, a friend of the boys' grandmother Marlena Martinez, set up the page after learning about their deaths on local media. The fund to cover memorial and medical costs for the boys has already raised more than $20,000. Too young: Authorities revealed on Monday that the two boys ended up in the canal because their mother was fighting off a bee . Waterway: Visible in this picture of the Yuma Canal are its steep banks. Along other parts of the canal there is a strong current running too . 'I would consider them family, and family is not always blood-related,' Ms Gleim told the Yuma Sun. 'I'm extremely\u2026 I'm at a loss of words with all of this.' After the tragic reason the boys died was revealed, authorities cautioned others on the seemingly benign canal. 'Many people typically do not comprehend how swift the current in these canals are and how deep the water can be,' Yuma police said. 'They also do not realize how difficult it is to climb back up many of the canal embankments.' Emergency: Above, the scene were the two boys were pulled out of the canal Friday morning in Yuma, Arizona . The toddlers are believed to have fallen in the water at 9.45am on Friday. After a police search that lasted more than an hour, the brothers were pulled from the water. They were flown by a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter to a Yuma hospital, where they were pronounced dead, Franklin said. The area along the canal is used by families for walks and by joggers and a family member was nearby when the boys ended up in the water. Yuma Fire Department spokesman Mike Erfert said their crews were called out on a possible drowning. Tragic: Eli and Silas are pictured above in a recent photo posted to their grandmother's Facebook page . Touching: As of Sunday, the fund to cover memorial and medical costs for the two boys had raised over $10,000 . Helicopters from the U.S. Border Patrol and the Marine Corps also flew over the canal searching for the boys. The Border Patrol helicopter crew spotted the brothers in the water, Erfert said, and they were pulled out at about 11.20am. Paramedics began immediate life-saving efforts and the boys were quickly loaded onto the Marine Corps helicopter for the trip to the hospital.",

Christopher Whitmore, 36, pulled up behind to where his wife was parked with their son Grayden in the backseat and killed his child before turning the gun on Melissa Ball, 27, and then himself. Police said Ball and Whitmore had a\u00a0history of domestic issues and were separated - but at this stage it is unclear what motivated the horrific shooting in Varnell. Killed his family: Christopher Whitmore murdered his wife Melissa Ball (left), 27, and their eight-year-old son Grayden (pictured together, right) before turning the gun on himself at a gas station in Georgia last night . Ball was seen pulling into the joint Shell station and McDonald's in her Ford Focus at around 7pm, when her husband drove up behind her in his 2010 Dodge. Both had got out of their cars when Whitmore drew a handgun and started shooting. A Tennessee man named Jeff Holmes, who said Ball was his niece, wrote on Facebook: 'Please pray for our family. My beautiful neice Melissa Ball and her son Grayden were taken from us tonight in Varnell Georgia. We are in total shock.' According to her Facebook page, Ball worked at a pediatrician's office in Dalton. Police say all of the victims lived in Beaverdale, around ten miles east of Varnell, New York Daily News reports. Horrific shooting: A gas station in Varnell, Georgia was seen cordoned off last night after\u00a0Christopher Whitmore shot his son, wife and then himself . A recent picture of her has attracted a flood of comments from bereaved friends, with one writing 'such an angel' and another posting 'miss you so much already dear friend'. Sheriff Scott Chitwood told The Dalton Daily Citizen the couple had 'domestic issues'. Police received the call at 6:49pm that people had been shot in the parking lot of a convenience center at 3896 Cleveland Highway. Chitwood added: 'Investigators have determined Ms Ball pulled up to a gas pump at the Shell station in her 2013 Ford Focus and immediately after she pulled up Christopher Eric Whitmore drove up and parked directly behind her. Investigation underway: Police said Ball and Whitmore had a history of domestic issues and were separated . 'They both exited their cars and both walked to the back door (passenger side) of the 2010 Dodge Mr Whitmore was driving. 'Investigators determined at that time Christopher Eric Whitmore pulled out a handgun and shot their son while he was sitting in the back seat of the Dodge. 'Whitmore then immediately pointed the gun at Ms. Ball and shot her, and then shot himself.'",

Virginia Roberts had hoped to join a lawsuit involving Andrew\u2019s friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile and sex offender. But last night Judge Kenneth Marra ordered her claims that she was a \u2018sex slave\u2019 to Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times should be \u2018struck from the record\u2019. Scroll down for video . Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. Her claims she was forced to sleep with him have now been struck from the court record . Prince Andrew pictured leaving an Easter service at Windsor Castle on Sunday. The judge ruled the details of the accusations against him had no bearing on the reopening of the lawsuit against Epstein . The judge refused to make a statement regarding the veracity of Miss Roberts\u2019s allegations, but issued an order that the \u2018lurid\u2019 and \u2018unnecessary\u2019 claims should not be involved in the Epstein case. \u2018At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\u2019 Prince Andrew is not mentioned by name in the ten-page ruling, made in the Palm Beach County court, Florida. But Judge Marra refers to the powerful people Miss Roberts was allegedly forced to have sex with by Epstein. Her claims of taking part in an orgy with the Duke and sleeping with him on two other occasions when she was 17 \u2013 below the age of consent in Florida \u2013 were described as \u2018immaterial and impertinent\u2019. In 17 words, the judge may have drawn a line under a controversy that has dogged Prince Andrew since January. Miss Roberts, referred to as \u2018Jane Doe 3\u2019 in court papers, and another woman were hoping to join two other alleged victims of Epstein in suing the U.S. government over a plea deal prosecutors struck with the financier. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave' But Judge Marra ruled yesterday that the Jane Doe 3 and 4 applications should be denied and it was therefore \u2018unnecessary\u2019 for them to be added as plaintiffs. When the court claim surfaced earlier this year, Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace refused to go into any details regarding the accusations. However, in late January he briefly referred to the allegations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he wanted to \u2018reiterate and reaffirm\u2019 palace statements that insisted he never had any sexual contact or relationship with Miss Roberts. She has repeatedly claimed she had sex three times with Andrew when she was 17 \u2013 a claim he emphatically denies \u2013 and served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington DC. But they were returned to sender. Her legal team\u2019s bid to serve papers on the Duke came after courier FedEx returned a similar letter as it was \u2018refused\u2019 by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. The court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17. She claimed that under the orders of paedophile Epstein she was \u2018forced\u2019 to have sex with the prince three times in 2001 \u2013 in London, New York and on Epstein\u2019s Caribbean island. The 55-year-old royal was so concerned about the allegations that he consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. Andrew\u2019s long friendship with Epstein was said to include lavish parties and exotic holidays, but it raised questions over the prince\u2019s choice of friends. He was introduced to the billionaire by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell. The fifth in line to the throne was forced to effectively cool, but not end, the friendship when sex claims were made against the financier. In June 2008, Epstein began serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to soliciting a girl, 14, for prostitution. Andrew was summoned by the Queen after pictures emerged of him in New York with Epstein in February 2011, after the financier had been released from prison. It emerged Epstein had given Andrew\u2019s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson \u00a315,000 to help reduce her debts. Last night Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The Duke was not a party to the court action and was not given the opportunity to rebut the allegations through the court. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Rangers are in the drop zone of the Barclays Premier League with 28 points as they prepare for a London derby at home to West Ham. 'If you win three games you're probably going to stay up,' said Ramsey. 'As long as we're above the line come the end of May we'll be happy. I just care if we win. I just take care of our own game. If we don't get good results it doesn't matter what they do. Queens Park Rangers boss Chris Ramsey believes his side will stay in the Premier League with three wins . Clint Hill reacts after QPR conceded a late goal against Chelsea to lose 1-0 at Loftus Road . Ramsey spoke of his dismay at the nature of the late defeat by Chelsea in their last game . 'We know the enormity of the task ahead but you can only plan and prepare as best you can and what happens happens. We understand there is pressure in these last few games. I can't say I don't feel pressure but it depends on how you deal with it.' He believes QPR's chances of achieving these victories from games against West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester will hinge on their an ability to kick the habit of conceding late goals, like the one which turned a draw into defeat on their last outing against Chelsea. 'It is down to a lack of continued concentration,' said Ramsey. 'The managers of other teams near the bottom would say the same. 'Not many teams are getting slaughtered but the quality at the top end is why they're there. We're not happy with late goals. We need to stop conceding those late goals.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe title race may be over in the minds of some, but Joe Hart is irrepressibly optimistic. Of course, he is paid to believe but there is some logic to his positivity when you consider how Manchester City won the league in 2012 and 2014 with late dramatic runs. \u2018It\u2019s kind of how we do it,\u2019 said Hart, when asked about City\u2019s need to overcome a nine-point deficit. \u2018We like to do it a different way. We\u2019ve not necessarily reached the standard week-in, week-out that we wanted to, but the beauty of football is that you get another chance and that starts on Monday at Crystal Palace. \u2018We\u2019ve got some massive games; eight big games to reach a level that we need to reach. We\u2019ve not necessarily done that all season but we feel we are in the right place now. We have a lot of rest time and there are no excuses. Everyone is fit and ready to go. We will never give up.\u2019 Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart insists his side are still capable of winning the Premier League title . Chelsea are nine points clear of Manchester City with both teams having eight games left to play . Chelsea are nine points clear of Manchester City . Hart is a good cheerleader. Last week he won his 50th cap at the age of 27 and was immensely proud of his achievement. And his club may need his leadership now. At the Etihad Stadium two weeks ago there was a distinct lack of fervour despite the 3-0 win over West Brom, as though a certain kind of resignation has set in regarding Manchester City\u2019s trajectory but Hart does not accept that. \u2018We\u2019ve proved it and the fans have proved it \u2013 we never give up,\u2019 he said. \u2018That is one thing that is part of Manchester City that we\u2019ve taken with us from the olden days. We\u2019ll never give up while anything is possible. We\u2019ll go for it. \u2018We have definitely moved on as a team since we first won the league in 2012. That was a massive achievement but now we expect it of ourselves. We have been disappointed at certain times this season but there are eight games to go and we\u2019ll give it all we\u2019ve got.\u2019 Hart himself is a good example of the adage that one should never give in. Dropped last season by Manuel Pellegrini and threatened this season by the \u00a36million signing of Willy Caballero, Hart is playing as well as ever, his penalty save against Lionel Messi and the subsequent performance at the Nou Camp a product of a long period of good form. Hart has proven his class after being dropped last season following a handful of mistakes . \u2018I feel pushed,\u2019 said Hart. \u2018I have personal pride. I push myself personally. I think the world of Willy. I think he is a fantastic goalkeeper and I know full well that if my standards drop, Willy will be in goal. That is how it is at Manchester City. That is how it is with England. I know it is the same thing here. I need to be on my toes and performing at a high level otherwise someone takes your spot.\u2019 And Hart is not content with game, striving to better himself. \u2018I can improve everything, management of the game. But I want to improve on everything and don't just say that lightly. I look at everything I do. You don\u2019t set limits. I want to keep going and keep pushing and keep my place in the two teams I\u2019m with \u2013 Manchester City and England. I hope the best is to come. That is what I\u2019ll be pushing to do. \u2018Every game is a rescheduled goal for me. It genuinely is. I\u2019ve enjoyed the two games with England but I turn my head to Palace now. That is the next game for me and the one I\u2019m looking forward to.\u2019 Hart labelled Buffon, who won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, a 'legend of the game' And if he needed any inspiration in that quarter, a look across to his opposite number on Tuesday night at the Juventus Stadium would have provided it. As Hart won that 50th cap for England, Gianluigi Buffon was winning his 147th at the age of 37 and proving as sharp as ever. The England goalkeeper is a fan. \u2018It\u2019s hard to look past Buffon. He\u2019s absolutely amazing. What a keeper \u2013 147 caps, countless titles, the World Cup, European trophies. What a goalkeeper and what a gentleman. He\u2019s real idol of mine and it\u2019s a real privilege to share a pitch with him. \u2018I\u2019ve got a long way to go. But to see people like that at the top level is a real good feeling. I like him. I\u2019ve watched his career and how he is around people. It\u2019s a small amount of time you spend with people when you are in the tunnel with them but he oozes class. 'He is a classy guy and it\u2019s great to have an icon like that. Fraser Forster played against Juventus a few times and said the same thing.\u2019 Only in one area will Hart not be emulating Buffon. With his designer stubble, flowing hair, and his silk waist coat and designer shirt, Buffon looked a little more like a successful artist or film-maker than a footballer as he left the Juventus stadium. \u2018He does look cool,\u2019 said Hart, with a degree of self deprecation. \u2018I\u2019ll never try to be him. With my mousey blonde hair, it wouldn\u2019t really work.\u2019",

William Kerr absconded from a bail hostel in Hull after he was released from HMP Stocken in Rutland on licence in January. The 53-year-old, who was jailed in 1998 for the murder of Maureen Comfort, was apprehended in the street in Waterloo, south London, around 7pm on Friday. William Kerr (left), who strangled Maureen Comfort (right) and put her body in a cupboard 20 years ago, has been rearrested after three weeks on the run . His arrest came after a \u00a35,000 reward was offered for information about his whereabouts on BBC's Crimewatch. Ms Comfort was last seen alive on December 4, 1995. The 43-year-old's body was found in January 1996\u00a0by relatives who broke into her flat after becoming increasingly worried about her whereabouts. It was discovered in a wardrobe in her bedroom. Kerr was jailed for life for murder at Leeds Crown Court alongside Christopher Moody. Both men lodged with Ms Comfort in the two months before her death and had a key to the property, the court heard at the time. Kerr served 15 years before being moved to approved premises 90 miles away. Kerr was jailed for life for murder at Leeds Crown Court (above) alongside Christopher Moody in 1998 . During the search he was described by police as a 'very dangerous man' and the public were warned not to approach him. They added that he needed to be\u00a0returned to prison 'as a matter of urgency'. Detective Inspector Eamonn Clarke, of North Yorkshire Police,  led the search for Kerr. He said: 'Thanks to some information received following the Crimewatch appeal we were able to track Kerr to a specific area of London. 'The information was vital to the effort to trace Kerr as he indicated when he was arrested that he was about to leave the London area after seeing himself on Crimewatch.

Carlo Ancelotti's side lost both La Liga matches against Atletico this season - 2-1 at the Bernabeu before a humiliating 4-0 away defeat - and have also been beaten twice and held to two draws in the Spanish Supper Cup and the Copa del Rey. Marcelo says Real Madrid's failure to beat Atletico in six attempts this season will have no affect on their Champions League quarter-final tie . Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo looked relaxed in training on Monday ahead of Tuesday's first leg . Brazil international Marcelo faces the media on Monday ahead of Tuesday's match at Vicente Calderon . But Brazil international Marcelo says he and his team-mates are not thinking about their recent form against Tuesday's opponents. 'We have played against Atletico a lot and something always changes,' Marcelo told reporters at a press conference on Monday. There are no favourites in a match like this. We will give everything on the pitch without thinking about previous games.' 'They are a great team. They never stop fighting and they are very intense. But we are not thinking about the last games against them. Now is completely different. We have two games to show that we can beat them.' Ronaldo and Bale leave the field dejected after Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico in February . The last time Real Madrid beat their local rivals was in the Champions League final last season . Carlo Ancelotti and Marcelo task questions at the pre-match press conference . 'We have to go out and give everything on the pitch this time. We will have to be very intense. We will have to fight.

Is it heart ruling the head among the United faithful? Or is there a genuine belief that serial winner Louis van Gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again? Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Van Gaal poses for pictures with United fans at the training ground during a day for the club's foundation . Van Gaal (pictured talking to fans) is starting to assert himself at the United after a stuttering start . If he is to take United back to the very top, he\u2019ll need more than Memphis Depay. I\u2019ve already established in this column recently that Van Gaal is a great, and he is a winner. I love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career. The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time \u2013 just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department \u2013 his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don\u2019t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it\u2019s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He\u2019s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he\u2019s dealt with Van Gaal\u2019s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I\u2019ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019s a winner and a leader \u2013 perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view \u2013 Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can\u2019t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney\u2019s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate \u2013 for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season \u2013 he\u2019s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble \u2013 European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that\u2019s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV\u2019s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It\u2019s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?",

Google confirmed to\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service (similar to PayPal and Venmo) in multiple federally-insured banking institutions. This is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their Wallet Balance because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000. Currently, Google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the FDIC. However, a Google spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the current policy has changed. The policy states that 'funds held by Google Payment Corp. or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Payment Transactions are not deposit obligations of Buyer, and\u00a0are not insured for the benefit of Buyer by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency', according to\u00a09to5. As a non-banking institution, Google Wallet, along with PayPal and Venmo, is not legally required to be federally insured. But with the new change to its policy, funds in Wallet Balance are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy. For example, for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not FDIC insured, if a company files for bankruptcy, the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back. But for users with FDIC insurance, they would receive their money from the government in a matter of days, according to Yahoo Finance. Details on when Google Wallet's user agreement will be updated were not provided. How Google Wallet works: . Google Wallet, launched in 2011, stores credit and debit card information, and lets shoppers pay for goods by tapping their phones against special terminals at store checkout counters. It works with any debit or credit card, on every mobile carrier. The service allows users to send money to anyone in the US with a Gmail address, or request money on-the-go, directly from their bank account, debit card or Wallet Balance. Users can spend received money through the service in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs with the Google Wallet Card, as well as transfer the funds directly to their bank account. It comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring, and users can disable their Wallet app or card from their Google Wallet account if they're ever lost or stolen. Source: Google Wallet . Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected Google Inc's request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the technology company of invading the privacy of users of its Google Wallet electronic payment service by sharing their personal information with outside app developers. The judge said Google must face claims it breached users' contracts, violated the federal Stored Communications Act which limits disclosure of electronic records, and violated a California consumer protection law. Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California said Google Wallet users may try to show that Google 'frustrated' the purpose of its own privacy policy by allowing 'blanket, universal disclosure' of their personal information to app developers whenever they bought apps in Google's Play Store. The lead plaintiff is Alice Svenson, an Illinois resident who said Google sent unnecessary personal information about her to YCDroid when she paid that developer $1.77 for an email app. She said Google raised the risk of identity theft by routinely sending information about Google Wallet users such as addresses and zip codes, phone numbers and email addresses to app developers. Svenson said the Mountain View, California-based company ceased the practice soon after the lawsuit was filed in September 2013. Her lawsuit seeks class-action status, damages of $1,000 per violation, punitive damages and other remedies.",

But now, nearly eight months after his passing, the young Oklahoma family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait, thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer. Kayli Henley was snapping pictures of six-month-old Taos and his 20-year-old mother,\u00a0Sierra Sharry, when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete. So Henley took a photograph of Smith from the family and, with a ghostly filter, fitted the image around his girlfriend and son,\u00a0as if he were standing over them. Scroll down for video . Family portrait: A photoshopped image shows\u00a0Sierra Sharry holding her six-month-old son Taos with her boyfriend, the baby's father, Lane Smith, standing behind them. Smith passed away before his son's birth . Sharry called the ghostly final picture 'amazing'. 'Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,' she told KOCO. After sharing the image to\u00a0her Facebook page, the photographer found that other people thought the image was amazing too. It has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times, and Henley has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one. In a post shared on the Facebook page, Sharry explained that in July 2014, she and 26-year-old Smith had been nervous about the impending birth of their son. 'We were scared as any new parents would be but ready for the adventure together,' she said. Excitement: 26-year-old Lane Smith, pictured with his girlfriend in the couple's pregnancy announcement, died after hitting his head in an accident in July 2014. His son was born just a few weeks later . When she was around eight months pregnant, they went to jet boat races in El Reno, she recalled. But the weather was too warm for Sharry, so she left her boyfriend there with his family. 'When I left Lane that day I had no clue it would be the last time I'd see him,' she wrote. But in the early hours of the next day, she awoke to a call that Smith had been rushed to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City after he had fallen and hit his head. She and her mother raced to his side. They never considered his injuries could be life-threatening, but once they got there, they were given 'absolutely no hope that Lane was going to make it'. 'July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,' she explained. 'I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child. And since that day I have felt so empty inside. A part of me will forever be missing. I loved that man more than life itself.' Strong: Sharry said that part of her has been missing since the death of Taos' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time. She is pictured in another image from the shoot . Missed: She said she knows that Smith, pictured left, will always be watching over her and their son, right . Their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months, Sharry asked Henley, who is baked in Yukon, if she'd be able to put together a family photo. 'I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,' Sharry explained to KOCO. So Rene created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online. 'It brought me to tears,' Sharry wrote about the photograph. 'This is how I picture us. Taos and I living our lives the best we can with Lane ALWAYS watching over our shoulder.' Rene said she was happy to be able to help. 'As soon as I met Taos, he had a smile that was so contagious, the happiest baby boy, and he instantly captured my heart,' she said on her Facebook page. '[I] never knew if I could make this reality for them. So glad I could and they can cherish this forever.'",

Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer . 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY . Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL . Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND . Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER . Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES . Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL . Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR . Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM . Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.",

A British nuclear submarine suffered \u00a3500,000 damage in a collision while tracking Russian vessels, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The 5,300-ton HMS Talent limped back to port with a huge dent and will be out of action for several months. Royal Navy top brass are investigating the incident. Last night, defence officials refused to disclose exact details of the crash \u2013 including where or when it happened \u2013 but they were adamant that HMS Talent struck \u2018floating ice\u2019 rather than a Russian sub. But the collision, which ripped a 6ft hole at the top of the conning tower, comes at a time of heightened tension between Britain and Russia in the airspace over the North Sea and beneath the waves. Britain is understood to be mounting frequent patrols of the North Sea and areas as far north as the Arctic Circle, while the Russians have increased their submarine activity by half in the past 18 months. Navy sources say the damage to the nuclear-powered submarine, which will cost as estimated \u00a3500,000 to repair, is consistent with striking an object while trying to surface. Surfacing can be a risky manoeuvre because sonar equipment on a submarine tends to look ahead for threats rather than above. In addition, radar scanners do not work underwater. After the crash, engineers from HMS Talent\u2019s 130-strong crew found that the impact had devastated the submarine\u2019s outer layer of acoustic tiles. These square-shaped 2in-thick tiles minimise the vessel\u2019s transmission of sound waves and other signals that could reveal her position. The Royal Navy\u2019s explanation that HMS Talent struck ice was also used to explain damage to British submarines during the Cold War which was later found to have been caused by enemy vessels. In 1981, the crew of HMS Sceptre were ordered to say they had hit an iceberg after their collision with the Russian submarine K-211. HMS Talent, which was launched in 1988, is a \u2018hunter-killer\u2019 submarine used to attack ships and other submarines, and also to perform a surveillance role.

Navy sources insist there was no such power problem on this occasion. Scroll down for video . The 5,300-ton HMS Talent limped back to port with a huge dent and will be out of action for several months. Above, the submarine is pictured before the crash off the Egyptian coastline . A Navy source said: \u2018Striking ice is a problem of the environment we work in. Some patches of ice show up on our scanners but not all, with the density of the ice also being a factor. On this occasion some damage was sustained by HMS Talent. \u2018A submarine is a very pressured environment and a lot can go wrong. You\u2019re in a tin can under the sea tracking Russian subs and trying not to get found ourselves. HMS Talent\u2019s captain, helmsman and her officers will have been making multiple calculations simultaneously and working in very testing conditions.\u2019 The activity of Britain\u2019s fleet of nuclear submarines is strictly classified. Last night, the Royal Navy would say only that the incident happened last year. The submarine was photographed last month on her arrival at the Submarine Refit Complex at Devonport, where the repairs are taking place. A Royal Navy spokesman said: \u2018HMS Talent suffered minor superficial damage after striking some floating ice last year. She remained fully operational and continued with her deployment.\u2019",

'It helps me stay young and I just keep going,' said Bill, who has worked there for the last nine years. Bill Dudley, Europe's oldest McDonald's employee, celebrating his 90th birthday at the outlet in Mold, Flintshire, where he works two days a week . Great grandfather and Second World War veteran Bill celebrates his special with fellow employees at McDonald's in Mold. He joined the team nine years ago after growing 'bored' pottering around the house . Wife Margaret, 71, has nicknamed her hubby Old McDonald. Bill's special day on Wednesday was marked with a cake and tickets for a weekend away. McDonalds hailed the great-grandfather as 'a real asset' to the team. 'I didn't expect such a nice surprise,' Bill said. 'But I suppose it's not every day that you turn 90. 'I still enjoy working. I come here two days-a-week, which not only gets me out of the house but I honestly love it.

Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, was arrested Wednesday night at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after returning on a flight from Turkey. He has now been charged in a criminal complaint with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, Wisconsin (pictured left in his mugshot on Wednesday and right in 2010 when he\u00a0registed on the sex offender's list) has been accused of flying to ISIS in a failed attempt to join ISIS . The criminal complaint, which had been under seal since Oct. 28, alleges that Van Haften talked to people about his plan before leaving the United States in August for Istanbul. The complaint cites Facebook posts from Van Haften that said he was unable to cross the border from Turkey into Syria. In one post, Van Haften complained that the people who were supposed to help him just wanted his money, that he had almost no cash left and that he was dropped off on a road in the country and never picked up. Wisconsin court records showed several previous convictions for Van Haften, including felony battery in 1998, second degree felony sexual assault in 1999 and disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in 2007, online court records show. He was apprehended at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday after getting off a return flight from Syria (file picture) All of the offenses occurred in Rock County. Van Haften was sentenced to three years' probation on the battery conviction in 1998, but his probation was revoked in 1999 and he was sentenced to a year in jail. He was sentenced to eight years' probation on the sexual assault charge in 1999, but that was revoked in 2000. He was then sentenced to seven years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Carlin from the Department of Justice said stopping people from traveling to the region to join the Islamic State is a 'top priority'. She said in a statement: 'Stemming the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and holding accountable those who attempt to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations remains a top priority for the National Security Division.

Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's Takahama nuclear plant. But locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui Prefecture, where the plant is located, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake. Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant. Since then, the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy, arguing it is essential to the country's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports. But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart. Keith Henry, managing director of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, which advises businesses on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy. \"That was a body blow [for Abe] because it's no longer a political issue, it's a legal issue. It changes the calculus and the dynamics,\" he said. \"It's now in the courts. And the government is powerless to do anything about it.\" READ MORE: Power company abandons robot stranded inside Fukushima plant . Anti-nuclear activists celebrated following the Fukui District Court's decision in their favor Tuesday. The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster. It said in a statement that \"scientific and professional findings\" showed that the safety of the reactors was assured. But the court ruled that the new safety standards were \"loose,\" lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said. The power company said it would appeal the decision. \"We deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended, and cannot accept it at all,\" it said in a statement. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tuesday that the country's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the \"world's strictest\" safety standards. The government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart, he said. Takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations. Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture's governor, although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court. Analyst Henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the Takahama decision, as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives. Prior to the Fukushima disaster, about 30% of Japan's energy was nuclear generated. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report from Tokyo.",

Larry Kramer, 79, says he believes what's written in his history book is true though he is selling it as fiction to avoid legal troubles. In Volume One of his two part book 'The American People,' Kramer says that Abraham Lincoln was gay and his killer John Wilkes Booth was actually Lincoln's spurned gay lover. 'We know that Abraham Lincoln was gay,' Kramer told CBS in an interview about the book which came out this month. Were they gay?: Writer and gay activist Larry Kramer claims that Abraham Lincoln (left) and George Washington (right) were gay . The American People: Volume one of the two part book by Larry Kramer explores prehistoric America's unwritten gay history up to the present day . Abraham Lincoln . According to Larry Kramer, Abraham Lincoln slept with several men including\u00a0actor John Wilkes Booth\u00a0who later fatally shot him in a theater on April 14, 1965. Kramer claims that the motive for murder was not Booth's anger over the Civil War but was his unrequited love for the former president. Another indicator that Lincoln was gay is that he would share beds with other men, especially when his wife Mary left town. One such man was\u00a0Captain\u00a0David Derickson who would visit Lincoln at a retreat from\u00a0the White House called the Soldier's Home. Lincoln has been quoted as saying of Derickson, 'The captain and I are getting quite thick.' George Washington . Larry Kramer says that historians just don't have 'gaydar' when it comes to studying historic figures and that George was was 'basically a big queen.' Larry Kramer said in an interview with Sirius that George\u00a0Washington\u00a0loved decorating battle gear and that he was a bit of a dandy in his love of showmanship. 'In the case of Washington, he was a big queen, basically,' Kramer said. 'He decorated everything. He designed all the uniforms, the buttons. The correspondence exists with all the dealers he dealt with in England to make everything. And then there was a man called Baron Von Steuben, who was German, who designed all the maneuvers for all the troops of all the great armies in Europe. And he kept getting thrown out after he made the armies real \u2013 like Rockettes . He got kicked out and he came to George. And he and George hit it off like nobody\u2019s business.' Alexander Hamilton . According to Kramer, Alexander Hamilton was in love with George Washington claims the pair had an erotic father and son attraction. Alexander Hamilton was also supposedly involved with a young officer named John Laurens to whom he wrote 'love letters. ' 'You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent. But as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have artfully instilled into me,' said one of those letters to Laurens. In another letter to Laurens, Hamilton calls himself, 'a jealous lover.' Men of Jamestown . Even though sodomy was considered taboo at the time, Larry Kramer says that a lack of women in Jamestown led many men to experiment with one another in their absence. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Larry Kramer of the initially all male settlement. 'Why is that not in the history books? Because all history books are written by straight people, and they don't wanna either admit that, or they wouldn't know how to recognize what we call 'gaydar.' According to Kramer, Jamestown was a mecca of gay sex where men chose to sleep with men because there weren't any women around. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Kramer. Kramer says it took him 40 years to write his 800 page history book that spans from pre-historic america all the way to the 1950s. 'It's called a 'novel,' but that's just to keep the lawyers away from me,' Kramer said. 'I believe everything in the book is true. Everything in there happened,' said Kramer who has long wanted to write a book on gay history. Spurned lover: Larry Kramer claims John Wilkes Booth, who murdered Abraham Lincoln, was one of Lincoln's spurned male lovers . The writer: Larry Kramer, 79, is an HIV positive American writer and gay rights advocate who spent 40 years writing his most recent book . 'It may look like fiction, but to me, it\u2019s not,' Kramer told the New York Times. 'Most histories have been written by straight people. There has never been any history book written where the gay people have been in the history from the beginning.It\u2019s ridiculous to think we haven\u2019t been here for ever.' Kramer says that John Wilkes Booth's murder had nothing to do about the outcome of the Civil war, rather Bookes felt spurned by the president. Kramer's book doesn't only touch on the gay history of politicians but it also talks about the about the HIV crisis in the nation which will be the book's second volume. Kramer, who is HIV positive, said that 35 years is too long for a plague like HIV to still be in existence. 'You'll hear all about the plague of AIDS in the second volume, and a lot about Ronald Reagan,' Kramer said. 'It's not a nice story, but it's one that needs to be told. If I've been kept alive for any reason, it was to tell this story.'",

The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14\u00a0Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino\u2019s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. \u2018He deserved it,\u2019 he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. \u2018He has the quality,\u2019 he said. \u2018So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).\u2019 Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. \u2018It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,\u2019 Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City\u2019s recent defeat here and complained that \u2018long balls into the box\u2019 made Sean Dyche\u2019s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal\u2019s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. \u2018Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??\u2019 tweeted Darren Anderton.

Kyle Walker receives treatment on the pitch before he was forced off through injury and replaced by Ben Davies for Tottenham . Walker was forced off through injury in the second half as Tottenham chased the win against Burnley at Turf Moor . Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game \u2014 they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England\u2019s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham\u2019s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson\u2019s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team\u2019s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

It was Boyd\u2019s industry that created the first decent chance of the game, the pressure he applied on Ryan Mason forcing the newly capped England player into directing a back-pass into the path of Ings. The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. \u2018I think we edged the game,\u2019 said Dyche afterwards. \u2018Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he\u2019s probably just hit too cleanly. But I\u2019m pleased by the fact that we\u2019ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.\u2019 Not that there was much evidence of that here.

Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella. CBS reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to Stella, who was born in Kerobakan Prison and who has urgent needs, including clothing and baby wipes. Scroll down for video . Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered\u00a0$150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.' The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her newborn Stella with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell last week, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying, 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.' As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit.' She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison.' She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime. Schaefer has admitted to hitting Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the trunk of a taxi they had ordered. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer\u2019s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about\u00a0either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. When the prison gates opened to allow the couple to exit last month, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her . Shortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly . Mack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother. Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell.",

Irwin Horwitz, an instructional associate professor in the university's department of maritime administration, told CNN affiliate KPRC that he had finally reached a breaking point. \"Enough was enough,\" Horwitz said. \"It became apparent that they couldn't do just some of the most simple and basic things that they should've been able to do at that point.\" In the email to students, KPRC reported, Horwitz said: \"I have seen cheating, been told by students to 'chill out,' 'get out of my space,' 'go back and teach' refuse to leave the room after being told to do so following inappropriate conduct, called a 'f*****g moron' several times by a student to my face...\" Horwitz added that students spread hurtful rumors about him, his wife and colleagues, and that he felt the need for police protection in class. John Shaw, a senior at Texas A&M Galveston and student in Horwitz's class, told KPRC he was worried about the job he has lined up after graduation. \"Just ridiculous, because, I mean, I had never had a problem in the class,\" Shaw said. \"I thought I had done pretty well, done pretty well on the first test and everything else that's going on.

University officials said the department head will take over teaching the strategic management class. \"None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail is because he or she hasn't performed the actual, you know, with the expectations for that particular class,\" Louchouarn said.

Jamie Anderson said the CGI characters did not have the same charm as the 'lovingly detailed' miniature puppets. Thunderbirds will return to our screens tonight 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects \u2013 real explosions rather than computer-generated ones. 'There is something utterly magical about seeing a puppet come to life under the skilled operation of talented puppeteers. 'Sadly for fans old and new alike, that's not going to be possible with the new series.' Iconic: Gerry Anderson with a model of Thunderbird 1 - his son Jamie has criticised the new CGI characters . Quest: As with the original show, the remake will feature the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world . Thunderbirds aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065. When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet\u00a0their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There is also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget . The iconic children's classic\u00a0aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002 . Jamie Anderson, son of Gerry, said there was something 'utterly magical' about seeing a puppet come to life . The updated version of the iconic show is not the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was a dismal flop, losing almost \u00a320 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show's co-creator, called it 'the biggest load of c**p' he had seen. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a modest budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Peter Jackson's animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics. Rosamund Pike, the Gone Girl star, will voice Lady Penelope in the new show and 89-year-old David Graham has returned to voice her driver, Parker. He has dropped his chauffeur uniform and now sports a roll-neck sweater. He also has a clipped Indian accent.

The reigning box office champion might have slowed from its blockbuster debut, but Furious 7 maintained first place for the third weekend in a row with an estimated $29.1 million, according to box office tracker Rentrak on Sunday. This brings the fast car sequel's domestic total to a staggering $294 million, well above the $202.8 million that Fast & Furious 6 had earned at the same point in the cycle in 2013. Scroll down for video . The fast car sequel, starring Vin Diesel, has raced to number seven on the list of highest grossing movies in just three weeks and is predicted to overtake the likes of Frozen and Iron Man 3 in a matter of weeks . Crashing hit: The blockbuster, also co-starring Vin Diesel and Jason Statham, has already earned $1 billion . On Friday, Furious 7 joined the $1 billion club at the worldwide box office, leaping into the top twenty grossing films of all time worldwide. Over the weekend, Furious 7 added even more to its international total, jumping even higher on the all-time worldwide charts. Furious 7 is now one of the ten highest grossing movies of all-time worldwide, ranking seventh with $1.152 billion. With Furious 7 still going strong, the question becomes now how high can it climb? The film will almost certainly race past Iron Man 3 and Frozen to join the top five all-time at the worldwide box office before the month is out. 'The film has set a new standard for the potential for box-office in the pre-summer month of April and has truly become part of movie folklore with its record setting numbers, strong reviews, spectacular word-of-mouth and of course the outpouring of support for late star Paul Walker,' Rentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. Poll position: Furious 7, starring the late Paul Walker, right, won the box office crown for the third week running, taking an estimated $29.1 million over the weekend . Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 came in a close second with an estimated $24 million. While the PG-rated comedy didn't perform as well as the first film's $31.8 million opening in 2009, it did surpass Sony's modest expectations. Also, it only cost $30 million to produce. 'It's a great result. It's going to be very profitable for us and a big success,' Sony's President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Bruer said. 'It was something that Kevin really wanted to do and we wanted to do it with him,' he said. 'Kudos to Kevin for working so hard in promoting the film.' Dergarabedian said 'Blart's' opening 'proves that if you give the people what they want, you can make a tidy profit.'

Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in\u00a0Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The \u00a0name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is \u2018likely\u2019 to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by\u00a0Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged. This famous photograph, produced in 1934, was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, on his deathbed . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . Another renowned sighting was made in 2001 by semi-retired photographer James Gray and his friend Peter Levings when they were out fishing on the Loch . This blurred picture, said to show the Loch Ness Monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express .",

Owen, like Sterling, started his senior career at Liverpool but eventually moved on to Real Madrid in 2004. But he says the 20-year-old is not good enough to make the same move to the Spanish capital. Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City are all said to be interested in the hottest property in English football, but Liverpool are determined not to let one of their star players leave, even with his contract expiring at the end of next season. Michael Owen has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool may not be all he hopes it would be .

Owen feels that Sterling is in a great place to develop, having done the same during his time at Anfield . Owen feels that Sterling is in a great place to develop, but argues that it doesn't mean the youngster owes the club anything. 'There is no question he (Sterling) has been at the perfect place to learn his trade and he has been managed fantastically well so far,' Owen said. 'But that shouldn't mean he should be indebted to the extent of feeling he owes everything to the club. If the club created top players from nothing then everyone would make it. 'A club is quick to get rid of a player when they don't serve a purpose anymore so why should a player not do what's best for him when the boot is on the other foot?'

Owen left Liverpool for Real Madrid in a \u00a316.8million move in 2004 before later moving on to Newcastle United . Sterling is expected to start for Liverpool in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off against Arsenal after Brendan Rodgers stated his intention to keep hold of the winger. And Owen says that the lack of a place in Real or Barcelona's teams mean that the only move he could make away from Anfield would be a sideways one. Sterling spoke in an interview with the BBC this week about his career ambitions and turning down the deal . The presence of Cristiano Ronaldo and co leave Owen unconvinced that a move to Spain would be right . 'Having watched him closely throughout his professional career, it it is fair to say that his progress has been spectacular,' he wrote on sportlobster. But he is still a notch or two off being \"world class\". 'I don't see what realistic options he has got if a move away from Anfield was on his mind. He wouldn't get into Real Madrid's or Barcelona's teams and any other move surely has to be seen as a move sidewards?'",

Half of voters agree with Ukip that immigrants should not immediately receive free HIV treatment, a poll suggests. Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders\u2019 debate last week by attacking the high cost of giving anti-retroviral drugs to sufferers not born in Britain. Ed Miliband said his comments were \u2018disgusting\u2019, Nick Clegg said they were \u2018politics of the lowest form\u2019 and chancellor George Osborne, when asked, said he was \u2018not going to dignify that with a response.\u2019 The Ukip leader insisted afterwards that he had the \u2018overwhelming support\u2019 of the British public for saying that foreign nationals with HIV \u2013 whom he said accounted for 60 per cent of the 7,000 cases a year \u2013 \u2018can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to \u00a325,000 per patient\u2019. He added: \u2018I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.\u2019 A YouGov poll of 1,906 adults found that 50 per cent would support \u2018people coming to live in the UK being banned from receiving treatment on the NHS for a period of five years\u2019.\u00a0Another 34 per cent opposed such a ban. A second question saw voters asked which statement best reflected their view. In this, 52 per cent thought Mr Farage was \u2018right to raise this issue - immigrants with serious conditions like HIV are costing the health service a large amount of money\u2019. This compared with 37 per cent who picked: \u2018Nigel Farage was just scaremongering - compared to the total cost of the NHS this is a drop in the ocean\u2019, and 11 per cent did not know. Interestingly, the respondents did not appear to particularly favour Ukip, saying on average that Mr Farage was only the fourth best-performing leader last Thursday, with Nicola Sturgeon in the lead, followed by David Cameron and Ed Miliband. It later emerged that Mr Farage\u2019s figures were a bit out \u2013 there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England. Diane James, an MEP and the party\u2019s justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted yesterday that Ukip would go on if Farage lost . Just over half (54 per cent) are foreign born, but most of them are thought to have been infected whilst living in the UK. The cost of anti-retroviral drugs per year gas been put at up to \u00a316,000 depending on the stage of infection. The Ukip leader, speaking on the campaign trail yesterday defended his remarks saying he wanted people to \u2018think and understand why their grandmother who is 85 finds it very difficult to get drugs for breast cancer but anybody can get on a plane from anywhere in the world, be HIV tested in London and receive antiretroviral drugs. Something, it seems to me, isn\u2019t right here.\u2019 Any foreign national - even a failed asylum seeker \u2013 who is diagnosed, has been entitled to free treatment since 2012 due to what experts say are the risks of allowing the virus to spread. A Ukip spokesman said: \u2018This poll finding shows yet again the disconnect that exists between the Westminster bubble and much of the population. 'Nigel Farage is the one leader who has the political courage to raise difficult issues and clearly millions of voters agree with that stance.\u2019 It later emerged that Mr Farage\u2019s figures were a bit out \u2013 there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England . Mr Farage took a blow yesterday as another poll showed he would fail to secure a Parliamentary seat. He has vowed to stand down as leader if he fails to become the MP for Thanet South, which he is fighting hard to win at the General Election. A private ComRes poll paid for by a Ukip donor put the Conservatives on course to retain the seat by a small margin. But Diane James, an MEP and the party\u2019s justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted yesterday that Ukip would go on if he lost, and that future leaders of the Eurosceptic party were waiting to \u2018put their hats in the ring\u2019. Patrick O\u2019Flynn, Ukip\u2019s economics spokesman, said in an interview on Sky News yesterday that Ukip were not seeking to withdraw treatment from HIV positive foreign nationals already receiving drugs from the NHS.",

A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media,\u00a0Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but\u00a0has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say. Confession: Vera Maresova (right) was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation . Sick: All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Vera Maresova (pictured covering her house outside court) thought their deaths would be attributed to natural causes . Location: Vera Maresova killed five women and one man over a four-year period at this hospital in Rumburk - a small town in the north of the Czech Republic . Prosecutor Frantisek Stibor said: 'She is not insane and knew exactly what she was doing. Therefore she is fit to stand trial. 'She used her knowledge of medicine to cause malfunctions in heart rhythms which led to heart failure and death.' The first murder was in January 2010 and was followed by another at the end of 2011.

The model, Georgina Gosden, allegedly punched a 21-year-old woman at Townsville's Mad Cow Tavern in on December 7 last year.\u00a0She carried out a similar attack on a 25-year-old woman in the same nightclub last April. Police are pursuing the charges against Ms Gosden, despite her most recent victim withdrawing the charges. Scroll down for video . Former Playboy model Georgina Gosden, 25, is facing charges for punching two women in the face at a pub . Both incidences took place at Towsnville's Mad Cow Tavern in north Queensland . The Townsville Magistrates Court heard Gosden was already at the Mad Cow pub when the younger woman walked in about 10.40pm. When she went to order a drink, Gosden allegedly got up from her seat, ran to the woman and punched her in the face. Court documents say the woman was known to Gosden,who told police 'she was going to find her [the victim]'. The model is said to have carried out a similar attack on a 25-year-old woman in the same nightclub last April . It is alleged Gosden punched both woman in the face at the Mad Cow Tavern . Ms Gosden has appeared in Townsville Magistrates Court to defend charges of common assault and being drunk and disorderly in a licensed venue . At the time of the incident, the Playboy model was already on bail, charged with assault occasioning bodily harm after she assaulted an old school friend at the same pub in April last year. The first victim said at the time that the model had come out of nowhere and punched her in the face. 'I walked inside the nightclub, I turned to my right and had only taken about three steps and was looking around. Then I saw someone in a long green fluorescent skirt coming \u00adtowards me quickly from my left,' the victim told police, according to the Bulletin. That charge was later dismissed and replaced with a drunk and disorderly charge. Magistrate Cathy Wadley agreed to let Gosden out on bail, despite police prosecutor Erica Forde advising against because of fears the model would re-offend. Ms Gosden's Solicitor, Callum Argaet, said\u00a0police had advised they would be proceeding with the most recent common assault charge, despite his firm applying for the charge to be dropped,  The Courier Mail\u00a0reported. Gosden signed with Playboy last year and described herself as a 'tomboy' in high school in a video on its YouTube channel . April's incident allegedly involved her punching another woman several times in the face . In a video on the Playboy YouTube channel, Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who grew up in Townsville and was born in England.

I\u2019ve been riding since I was 9, I try to ride horses every day,' Gosden said. The model was granted bail by the magistrate but police prosecutors feared she would re-offend . Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who was not 'very girly' when she was in high school . Despite her budding career as a glamour model, Gosden confessed she was not 'very girly' when she was younger. 'The type of girl I was in high school, I was definitely a tomboy. I wore baggy shirts and board shorts,' she said. 'I wasn't very girly until a lot later on when I started to get those curves in all the right places.'

It is a painful and embarrassing condition that affects millions of British women. Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth. Complications include an uncomfortable dragging or \u2018full\u2019 feeling, discomfort during sex or stress incontinence. Although up to half of women are thought to suffer to some degree, far fewer seek help, and many who do are offered just one solution: a hysterectomy. While surgical removal of the reproductive organs solves the immediate problem, it also ends fertility, and with three months of recovery needed, it is no quick fix. Now, a leading gynaecologist has claimed thousands of patients may be undergoing the drastic operation needlessly. He is one of a growing number of surgeons who claim not enough women are offered the alternative: a half-hour keyhole procedure that uses an implanted mesh \u2018sling\u2019 made from nylon to lift and hold the womb back in place, providing a permanent solution to a prolapse and preserving fertility. The procedure, called a sacrohysteropexy, is rare, with just 1,072 admissions for the surgery in the past three years. By contrast, there were 145,310 admissions to hospitals in England in the past three years for hysterectomies due to conditions such as fibroids, pelvic pain or cancer, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Surgeon Jonathan Broome, who has performed more than 1,000 sacrohysteropexies in the past 15 years, has called for the option to be made more widely available on the NHS so women of child-bearing age are not forced to choose between quality of life or the chance to have children. \u2018Most women requiring surgery for a prolapse will be referred for a hysterectomy by their GP,\u2019 says Mr Broome, who performs the \u00a34,000 procedure for both NHS and private patients at hospitals in Lancashire and Greater Manchester. \u2018That means some women are faced with the dilemma of living a normal life without a prolapse, or the possibility of having children. 'Far too many GPs recommend hysterectomies as the solution to a prolapse, when a sacrohysteropexy is a much better alternative. It\u2019s a shorter operation, with shorter recovery time because it is less invasive, and fertility is not put at risk.\u2019 Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth (file image) Common causes of prolapse include childbirth, lower levels of oestrogen at menopause, being overweight and chronic illnesses such as lung diseases, which create pressure inside the abdomen from coughing. Half of women over 50 will have symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and more than one in ten will have had surgery for the problem by the age of 80. Concerns have been raised about the use of mesh implants in gynaecological procedures, with some women in Scotland and the US complaining of problems including bleeding and infections. But consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones says the risk of complications where mesh is inserted abdominally is very small. Medical watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has received two reports of adverse incidents relating to a sacrohysteropexy since 2011. \u25cfA sacrohysteropexy is keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic to put the womb back into its normal position. \u25cfTiny cuts are made in the stomach through which a telescope and instruments are passed. \u25cfA piece of mesh is inserted via an incision along the bikini line. Using tiny needles, one end of the mesh is attached to the back of the cervix and the other to the coccyx, and it is fixed with metal staples. The mesh is also covered with a thin layer of tissue to prevent scar tissue forming, encouraging the tissue to grow and make the repair stronger. \u25cfIt can stay in place indefinitely and does not require a repeat operation. \u25cfThe procedure takes half an hour and involves an overnight stay in hospital. Mr Spence-Jones agrees that too many women are given the wrong advice on what surgery is right for them. \u2018There seems to be a notion in general practice that taking everything \u2013 in other words, a hysterectomy \u2013 is the answer to a prolapse, when that isn\u2019t the case,\u2019 he says. \u2018Sparing the fertility is a reason for considering procedures other than a hysterectomy, but not the only one.\u2019 One woman who says her life has been transformed by a sacrohysteropexy is 44-year-old mother- of-two Karen Bane, from Lancashire. She suffered feelings of bloatedness following the birth of her daughters Gabrielle, seven, and Jessica, five. \u2018I felt sluggish \u2013 I had back pain, sitting was uncomfortable and intercourse was painful. I\u2019d also started to have leakage. It was mortifying being a woman in my early 40s and not being able to control my bladder. \u2018I put up with the symptoms for five years, but when I started to have bleeding, I knew enough was enough. I was a mother of two young children, yet all I could see were years of misery in front of me.\u2019 Karen went to her GP with her symptoms in May 2014 and was referred to Mr Broome. He performed the procedure at Euxton Hall Hospital in Chorley, Lancashire, last October. Karen says the procedure has given her a new lease of life. \u2018I can run, skip and hula-hoop with my daughters without giving it a second thought,\u2019 she explains. \u2018I feel so much more feminine since my operation \u2013 my only battle scars are tiny nicks on my stomach. And because I had a sacrohysteropexy rather than a hysterectomy, everything is still there. It\u2019s not something we are planning to do as we feel our family is complete, but the chance to have another child has not been taken away from me.\u2019 Why should I take... Creatine . Creatine is a compound found in muscle tissue that increases the body\u2019s ability to produce energy, and is often used by athletes to boost performance during high-intensity exercise. But there is evidence that taking 5g of creatine daily can deliver a short-term boost to brain power. An Australian study involving 45 volunteers found that those who took creatine for six weeks performed better in IQ and memory tests than those who were given a placebo.

Can you smell when it's going to rain? Professor Barry Smith, founder of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says: \u2018Yes you can. Air pressure falls and humidity increases when it is about to rain, and our noses act like a barometer, picking up these subtle changes in the air. \u2018Humidity makes smells more intense. The smell gets stronger still when rain starts to fall, as droplets of water will pick up molecules from the surface they hit \u2013 such as grass or dirt \u2013 and carry them into the air.\u2019",

Though the 22-year-old is no longer in a medically induced coma, she remains unresponsive, Cissy Houston said in a statement Monday after visiting her granddaughter. \"Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me,\" Houston said. \"We can only trust in God for a miracle at this time.\" Houston's statement matched that from a source with knowledge of Brown's condition, who told CNN on Monday that she remained in the same neurological state she has been in for nearly three months. She does not respond to visitors or familiar voices, and her eyes do not follow a person around the room, the source told CNN. She also has a tracheostomy in her throat, the source said. The reports come two days after Brown's father, Bobby Brown, said his daughter's condition had improved. \"I can say today, Bobbi is awake. She's watching me,\" Brown told the audience at Dallas' Verizon Theatre. The audience cheered. In a statement Monday, an attorney for the Brown family said that Bobbi Kristina Brown's condition has improved but that the kind of life she will lead remains to be seen. \"Doctors have indicated that she will have a long life,\" attorney Christopher Brown said. \"However, Bobbi Kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process, and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come.\" Who's who in the Bobbi Kristina Brown case? Bobby Brown was in an \"emotional state\" on stage when he made the remarks about his daughter being awake, according to the statement. \"She has made it out of ICU, opened her eyes and started a rehabilitation that will be long and hard,\" said Bobby Brown's wife, Alicia Etheredge-Brown.",

A survey of 1,001 British Muslims found that one in four of this cohort had some sympathy with those who decide to join terror organisations such as ISIS. The figures show that among young and female Muslims, one third have sympathy for the Jihadi runaways despite the deplorable images of ISIS atrocities posted on the internet. Eight per cent agreed they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten British Muslims partly blame the security services for radicalising young Jihadis . Eight per cent of British Muslims said they had 'a lot of sympathy' for the likes of Jihadi John, pictured . Six out of ten strongly condemned those, such as Jihadi John, who have joined ISIS. The survey\u00a0conducted by Survation on behalf of Sky News found that one-third of all Muslims felt they are viewed with suspicion by non-Muslims. It follows a similar poll earlier this year that found more than a quarter of Muslims sympathised with the Charlie Hebdo attackers, who brutally murdered journalists at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. Yesterday's Survation study of 1,001 non-Muslims, 44 per cent agreed they were more suspicious of Muslims than they had been previously. The pollsters asked Muslims and non-Muslims about whether they felt Islam was 'compatible' with British values and the British way of life. According to the survey, three quarters of Muslims agreed their religion was compatible with the values of British society, with 14 per cent disagreeing. For non-Muslims, less than one quarter viewed Islam as compatible with British values with around half saying the religion was incompatible. One in five followers of Islam believe that British Muslims do not do enough to integrate into society, while 64 per cent believe they do, the pollsters found. Another six per cent felt it was not important for Muslims to fit into British society. Their families: 44% . Government: 15.1% . Religious authorities: 8.8% . Police: 3% . Schools: 2.2% . No-one: 4.6% . Other: 22.1% . 1,001 Muslims polled by Survation for Sky News . The researchers found that one in seven non-Muslims had sympathy for those who have joined ISIS. The researchers found that almost 40 per cent of Muslims agreed that the security services were partly responsible for radicalising young Jihadis, compared with 16 per cent of non-Muslims. Meanwhile more than half of the Muslims surveyed said it was their responsibility to condemn terrorist attacks by Muslims in the name of Islam, while a third said it was not. When it comes to stopping young Muslims joining terrorist groups, 44 per cent felt it was the responsibility of their families to set them straight. More than 15 per cent said it was the government's responsibility, followed by religious authorities (nine per cent), the police (three per cent) and schools (two per cent). The father of one of the three east London schoolgirls who fled to Syria to become 'jihadi brides' blamed the police for failing to keep track of them. Abase Hussen (circled) blamed the police and schools for allowing his daughter to travel to Syria to join ISIS, only for footage to emerge of him at an extremist rally in central London . More than a quarter of Muslims polled in a previous survey said they had sympathy for the Charlie Hebdo attackers . Abase Hussen\u00a0gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls\u2019 actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe issued a grovelling apology to the family, only for footage to emerge showing Mr Hussen at an extremist rally in central London. He could be seen standing just feet from one of Lee Rigby's killers while yelling: 'Burn, burn USA.' The survey comes two months after a separate poll found that more than quarter of Muslims said they had sympathy for Charlie Hebdo attackers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who killed 12 on their rampage around Paris. That poll, commissioned by the BBC, also found that 32 per cent of Muslims were 'not surprised' that the massacre took place. And more than 10 per cent of the 1,000 British Muslims interviewed agreed that the magazine 'deserved' to be attacked. The Muslim Council of Britain told the\u00a0Daily Telegraph: 'For many, current counter-terrorism measures, particularly related to the Prevent strategy, actually lead to greater alienation as Muslims are seen through the lens of security, rather than tackling the scourge of terrorism itself.' The Council said it was pleased that the survey 'once again confirms that Muslims feel British and have a strong affinity with our shared universal values'.",

In a case that was condemned around the world, Luo Kun Kun was expelled from his village when locals - including his own grandfather - signed a petition to banish him to 'protect villagers' health'. Following that cold-hearted decision, the mournful child explained how, 'nobody plays with me, I play alone'. But now a specialist school in Linfen, a city in southern Shanxi Province, has stepped in to help. The Red Ribbon School is the only school in China equipped to look after and educate HIV-positive children. Kun Kun was refused admission to\u00a0schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone . The five-year-old has now been admitted a place at the Red Ribbon School in Linfen, China, . After being banished from his village, Kun Kun finally has a home where he is cared for and looked after . Kun Kun contracted the virus from his mother when she was pregnant with him, but was only diagnosed when he was five years old. His mother and stepfather worked in other provinces, so he was raised near the town of Xichong with his non-blood-related grandparents, who had adopted his stepfather as a child. The boy was refused admission to local schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. When he was diagnosed, his grandparents found themselves isolated in their village of Shufangya in south-eastern China's Sichuan province\u00a0and so sided with the locals. At a special meeting on December 7 last year, 203 village residents signed a petition asking the authorities to 'carry out preventative isolation measures by taking Kun Kun away from the village, and protect the health of the villagers and children'. It went on to say that Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community'. He was also referred to as a 'ticking time bomb'. Wang Yishu, party chief of Shufangya village, said: 'The villagers sympathise with him, he is innocent, and only a small child. But his AIDS is too scary for us'. Kun Kun was forced to play alone in his home village, but has now been admitted to a specialist school . The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's plight made worldwide headlines . However the future is now looking up for Kun Kun, after he was given a place at the boarding school last week. The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's desperate plight made worldwide headlines. Headteacher Guo Xiaoping said: 'A good social and educational environment is important for Kun Kun and with the help of teachers, he is more open and polite than before'. He added: 'Kun Kun's physical strength is notably below that of the other students. Fortunately, he has been sent here in time, and started taking medication last November. At Kunkun's age, it's crucial that he undergoes proper treatment.' Kun Kun did not say a word when he arrived at the school, according to the headteacher, but can study and talk like a normal student now. The devastating case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China . The child was forced out of his village when villagers signed a petition asking the authorities to remove him . The petition signed by villagers said Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community' and referred to him as a 'ticking time bomb' Knowledge of HIV/AIDS in China is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from . Kun Kun was banished from the village of Shufangya, near\u00a0the town of Xichong (shown on this map) The case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China, where many sufferers face widespread discrimination. The problem is so great, even medical workers sometimes refuse to touch those diagnosed with the disease. The latest figures released by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission showed a total of 497,000 people in China have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS since the country's first case in 1985. China has a population of 1.36billion. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from, experts have said. Officials are reportedly planning to educate the villagers who banished Kun Kun through a campaign. The Nanjing-based anti-discrimination NGO Justice for All wrote a letter to party chiefs in Sichuan calling on them to punish school chiefs and local officials for their 'Cultural Revolution style', a reference to the Mao Zedong-inspired public denunciations of 'foes'. 'We cannot imagine how Kun Kun will grow up and look back on the experience of childhood,' said a draft of the letter.",

A former Celtic star tried to dodge performing unpaid work for shoplifting from Harrods - after claiming it would disrupt his search for a new club. Andre Blackman, 24, who now plays for doomed Championship side Blackpool FC, stole a jacket worth more than \u00a31,000 from the world famous store in Knightsbridge. Blackman, who has been told he is \u2018surplus to requirements\u2019 by Tangerines boss Lee Clark, described the offence as a \u2018moment of madness.\u2019 He was ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after Hammersmith Magistrates\u2019 Court was told he fled from the shop with the \u00a31,225 jacket. He was arrested shortly afterwards and the jacket was recovered. Blackman told Deputy District Judge Samantha Mace: \u2018It was just a moment of madness. It was not something that I intended to do, or something I do regularly. \u2018I\u2019m just absolutely speechless.\u2019 Blackman told the judge his attempts to find a new club might be hindered if he was forced to carry out community work. He said the travelling to different clubs would be the biggest problem. Explaining his situation, he said: \u2018I have got my current agent looking around on my behalf and there have been a few clubs that might be interested. \u2018And because we are closer to the end of the season they are just waiting to see whether they are going down or staying up.\u2019 \u2018Once I do work for a club I would have to come back to the court and say that something has come up.\u2019 Judge Mace told Blackman, who temporarily resides in a hotel in Blackpool using the \u00a3125 living allowance he receives from the club, that he would be more than capable of carrying out unpaid work before the new season begins. Blackman has already played for 11 clubs in his short career. Blackpool defender Blackman has played just three Championship games for the Tangerines this season . Blackman has been told by Blackpool boss Lee Clark that he is surplus to requirements at Bloomfield Road . He played for Arsenal\u2019s academy between 2001-06, and Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s between 2006-07. Blackman signed his first professional contract with Bristol City in 2009, making his debut in a League Cup match against Brentford in August 2009, before playing for AFC Wimbledon, Celtic, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Plymouth Argyle, Dover, Maidenhead, and most recently Blackpool. He was awarded \u2018Tackle of the Year\u2019 at Celtic when he accidentally collided with manager Neil Lennon during a match, sending him crashing into the turf . Judge Mace told Blackman his offending was at the \u2018lower end\u2019 of the spectrum, and that 40 hours of unpaid work could be completed before September. She added that if the order really hinders him from finding a new club then he can apply to the court to be sentenced in another way. Judge Mace said \u2018Because you haven\u2019t been signed by a club just yet, you should be able to complete the hours before the new season, and if you really really can\u2019t do it you can make an application to the court to deal with sentence in another way.\u2019 The judge ordering him to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order and to pay \u00a385 in costs. \u2018As I have said, because the goods were of a high value, the fact you do have a similar conviction - albeit a long time ago - and the fact that you did try to run away from the shop before being apprehended by the police, this makes it serious enough to merit a community order. \u2018In the present circumstances I do think it\u2019s appropriate for such an order to be made. \u2018It would be far more serious if you had not pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.\u2019 Blackman, of Edymion Road, Brixton, southwest London, must complete his community service by April next year.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA former commander of the Metropolitan Police's elite Flying Squad has said the Hatton Garden gem heist could be linked to the huge underground fire which ripped through London last week. The massive fire started  last Wednesday and took more than 24 hours to put out. John O'Connor, a highly experienced former police detective, has claimed the major power outage and the proximity of the multi-million burglary was far more than a coincidence. Scroll down for video . A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . It came shortly after firefighters  battled a major fire in Holborn - just 500 metres from the raid site . Speaking on LBC, Mr O'Connor said: 'Yeah, I think that probably was deliberate. 'I've never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that. That seems to me as too much of a coincidence.' He also said that in his opinion, to succeed with such a complicated and ambitious crime, the gang must have had some inside help. He added: 'You're gonna have to have a detailed layout of the whole of the business. So clearly they got that from somebody on the inside.' He later told Sky News: 'You've got a major strong room, there's no sign of a forced entry, they've apparently been able to abseil down the lift shaft to get access to the vault - I just find it astonishing that it was that easy. 'The fact that there is no sign of forced entry, what does that mean? That someone left the door open? That someone left the windows open? Former head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, John O'Connor, pictured, said the Holborn fire and the raid could be linked . 'It smacks all the time of inside aid, all of the way through it. This doesn't look to me like a genuine sort of smash and grab raid by determined criminals, this looks like they've had accomplices on the inside.You wouldn't go to attack a building like that unless you knew you could gain access.' The London Fire Brigade said they do not believe that the blaze was caused deliberately. Fire experts said their initial assessment showed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the Victorian tunnels running below ground, damaging an eight inch gas main which ruptured and fuelled the flames. Fresh details of the daring heist emerged yesterday as police forensic teams continued to sift through the rubble in the vault. It is believed an alarm was triggered when the professional gang broke into the building in the heart of London\u2019s jewellery district. A security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the property on Good Friday before leaving when he found nothing untoward. Police have refused to say whether officers were despatched to investigate around the same time. The gang used a heavy-duty drill weighing 77lb to bore through a reinforced 7ft concrete wall to reach the vault. When the raid was discovered on Tuesday, police discovered cheaper jewels left strewn amid a large heap of rubble in the vault. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad said: \u2018I\u2019d say it\u2019s a sophisticated offence and clearly it would have taken some pre-planning. It\u2019s organised. It\u2019s people who have planned it and they know how they were going to go about it. \u2018I would imagine that the pool of people [who could carry out the heist] is quite limited.\u2019 The  fire started underground just several hundred yards from where the heist took place a few days later . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . It has also emerged that celebrities and Premier League footballers could be among the victims of the thieves. A source told the Daily Mail: \u2018At least two of the jewellers have gems in the vault which have been bought by footballers and celebrities. They are waiting nervously to find out if they are among the victims.\u2019 Mr Johnson described how the gang gained access to one of the offices on the second floor of the building where they disabled the lift before climbing down. Once in the basement the thieves forced open the lift doors to get close to the vault. They used a \u00a33,500 Hilti DD350 drill, which is commonly used on large construction sites, to drill through the reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault. Joel Vinsant, secretary of the Drilling and Sawing Association, said that even with high-tech equipment, it may have taken hours for the thieves to drill through the concrete. He said: \u2018What they might have done is to bore several holes with a rig-based drill until they had made a space big enough to get through, rather than boring one hole and breaking through. It could have taken up to an hour per hole.\u2019 Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Police yesterday revealed the thieves used a Hilti DD 350 drill to get through the two-metre thick vault walls . During the raid the gang used an angle grinder and crowbars to force their way into 70 deposit boxes to steal the gems and cash inside. They then made their escape before employees arriving for work on Tuesday spotted the raid. Mr Johnson added: \u2018The scene is chaotic. The vault is covered in dust and debris and the floor is strewn with discarded safety deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars. \u2018There is no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building. We are in the process of identifying the owners of the safety deposit boxes and contacting them to take statements and find out what has been stolen.\u2019 He said his team had only just reached the vault because of the amount of debris at the scene. Mr Johnson added: \u2018It\u2019s got to be a slow, painstaking and methodical forensic process to get in there.\u2019 Experts fear the thieves may have already smuggled the jewels out of the country and are planning to cut up the larger gems to make it easier to sell them on the black market. One jeweller who rents a deposit box said police have identified the owners of 30 boxes which had been broken into. Furious jewellery dealers today accused the manager of the safe deposit of 'gross negligence'. Pictured: Felix Stephens (left) and\u00a0Gerald Landon (right)",

His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs \u2013 a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of \u2018We\u2019re rich but our team is s***\u2019 and \u2018Where\u2019s the money gone?\u2019 in protest at Ashley\u2019s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of \u00a318.7million and later revealed they have \u00a334m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. \u2018I can understand why fans are frustrated,\u2019 said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. \u2018It\u2019s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there\u2019s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they\u2019ve been. They think \u201cWhere else can I make money? Oh a football club\u201d. \u2018I\u2019ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it\u2019s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . \u2018People will say as supporters you\u2019ve got to come back, you\u2019ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? \u2018Since Mike Ashley\u2019s been here they\u2019ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. \u2018So he\u2019s balanced the books - he\u2019s made money because he\u2019s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be excited yourself?\u201d. \u2018I\u2019m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. \u2018Now it\u2019s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there\u2019s nothing happening? There\u2019s no cup run, I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why he wants to own a football club.\u2019 Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club\u2019s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . \u2018I think you\u2019ve got to get the balance right. It\u2019s not just about making money,\u2019 he said. \u2018Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn\u2019t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn\u2019t work. \u2018Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. \u2018To reconnect has to be the best way forward.\u2019 Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game .",

Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Scannell, Gobern, Coady (Hogg 81), Butterfield, James, Wells (Bunn 88), Miller . Subs not used: Edgar, Murphy, Wallace, Lolley, Billing . Booked: James, Butterfield . Scorers: Gobern 38, Hudson 41, James 45, Wells 72 . Derby (4-4-2): Grant, Shotton, Keogh, Whitbread (Christie 27), Warnock, Hendrick, Hughes (Russell 79), Bryson (Dawkins 9), Ince, Bent, Lingard . Subs not used: Forsyth, Ward, Sammon, Roos . Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.",

No matter, it was worth a try. Now on to the next one. If Rafael Benitez wants to return to English football after leaving Napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic Olympic Stadium in a year's time. West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost. Sam Allardyce is not the man to lead West Ham into their new exciting adventure at the\u00a0Olympic Stadium . Allardyce (left, pictured behind Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini) has not been up to scratch . Click here to read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's brilliant column on Jack Grealish . The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom. If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game \u2014 31 points from 17 matches \u2014 they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season \u2014 12 points from 16 games \u2014 they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival. Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project .",

Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents, and according to the publication at least 300 police accessed the files. Acting Commissioner of West Australian Police, Stephen Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states\u00a0police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8 when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued. The next day the Perth-based former AFL star surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station.",

After next month's election, ministers could be asked to make sure Easter Day always falls between April 9 and 15, so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season. In 1928, the Easter act was passed in Parliament to make sure that the holiday weekend would be a fixed date in April. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and his wife Samantha attend an Easter Sunday service at St Nicholas Church in Oxfordshire. After next month's general election, minister could be asked to consider fixing the date of Easter . Both the House of Commons and House of Lords passed the Act but it was unable to get the agreement of churches and therefore has never been implemented. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church did not object to the plans although, they were never seriously discussed. But just before the dissolution of Parliament last week, Conservative Sir Greg Knight, who is defending his East Yorkshire seat at the general election, asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. This also prompted the National Secular Society to write to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding Easter be a set date in April. Pope Francis leads Easter Mass in St Peter's Square in the Vatican. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church do not object to the plans to fix a date for Easter . The letter by the society's executive director Keith Porteous Wood, said: 'The variation of the date of Easter by over a month causes significant and unnecessary inconvenience. This is particularly disruptive to the orderly planning of school terms and to business. 'As you will be aware, the law requires large shops, including supermarkets and even DIY stores, to close on Easter Sunday. 'The high proportion of the population that are not observant Christians, be they religiously unconcerned or of other faiths, are prevented from using them then, when many would want to do so. 'We support the rights of those who wish to observe Easter, but is is unreasonable and disrespectful to the remainder of the population for the operation of the law to prevent them from shopping then in such outlets.' Spectators gather to watch the The Passion of the Christ production on Good Friday in Trafalgar Square.\u00a0But just before the dissolution of Parliament, Conservative Sir Greg Knight asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday always falls on the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon . The Local Government Association and the Family and Childcare Trust have also backed the plan, saying that at least the two-week Easter school holidays should be the same every year to allow parents to plan childcare. However, according to the Independent Business Minister Jo Swinson said there was 'no indication' that Easter would become a fixed date. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday is always the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon. The Paschal full moon is the first full moon occurring on or after the spring equinox, meaning Easter weekend usually falls any time between March 22 and April 25. But since this shifts from year to year, most people follow the calendrical spring equinox, which is reckoned as March 21. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Easter is determined using the Julian calendar and is always celebrated after the Jewish festival of Passover. This year it will be celebrated on April 12, next Sunday.",

Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.",

Ceara Lynch, from Portland, Oregon, takes the more traditional dominatrix idea a step further, not just dominating her customers but demeaning, shaming and generally humiliating them. And the 28-year-old entrepreneur says that making money this way\u00a0\u2014 which she has been doing since she was 17\u00a0\u2014 has been a dream. Risqu\u00e9 business: Ceara Lynch, 28, says her career began when she realized how much money she could make from selling her used underwear online; her first pair sold for $70 . In a recent interview with Salon, Ceara explains that she got started in the industry by accident. When she was 17, Ceara was on a dating website when one particular suitor intrigued her; the meaner she was to him, the more interested in her he became. She went on to seek out similar men, eventually finding a website called Ebanned where she could sell her used underwear. Her first pair sold for $70. A tame entrance into the world of humiliating men for money soon escalated to selling more personal items online, taking provocative phone calls, and performing live webcam shows. Taking control:\u00a0'Guys really like the idea of me ruining them in this way,' Ceara says . Real-life dating: Ceara says she's up-front about her job when she's dating, and she's had three serious relationships over the course of her career . 'I make most of my money from videos,' she says, adding that custom videos cost $1 per minute and subscribers pay a monthly fee of $39.99 for access to her site. 'They are [point of view]-style videos, which means it\u2019s just me and the camera, and I am looking at the camera and talking to the camera so that the viewer feels like I\u2019m talking to them.' 'I just tap into various fetishes and they\u2019re all just under the umbrella of [female dominance]. I always play a dominant role, and I tap into things like cuckolding, small penis humiliation, foot fetish, toilet slavery, giantess \u2014 which is this fetish where guys imagine this giant woman that\u2019s going to come and crush them with her feet or swallow them whole \u2014 different stuff like that.' Besides paying for subscriptions and purchasing the personal items that Ceara sells online, customers can also mail Ceara cash, buy her gift cards to Amazon, Southwest Airlines, or a massage parlor, or purchase items off her Amazon wishlist, which includes a $399.99 GoPro,\u00a0$1,295 Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and a $23 Pikachu adult cosplay costume. No secret: Friends and family know what Ceara does for a living, and her dad thought she was a 'genius' when he learned how she was making money . While such interests might scare off some people, Ceara likes the fact that she is privy to intimate knowledge that her customers don't necessarily reveal in their personal lives. 'I think it\u2019s fascinating and I think it\u2019s also flattering, in a way, that guys are telling me things that they don\u2019t tell anyone else,' she says. Ceara also isn't quite as excited about humiliating her customers as they are about being humiliated, which she says makes it easy for her to compartmentalize and separate her job from her personal life. 'I do enjoy my work, I think it\u2019s really fun and I get a kick out of it ... But I definitely don\u2019t like it in the same way that my clients like it.'",

The drug was developed by the British pharmaceutical giant Astra Zeneca with the original aim of treating certain types of tumour, but was shelved after it proved ineffective. Scientists at Yale University in Connecticut in the US have revealed how the treatment, called AZDO5030, restored memory in mice given Alzheimer's disease. An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal\u2019s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people. The charity estimates that 60,000 deaths are attributable to dementia every year and that there will be one million people with the disease in the UK by 2025. It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is \u00a326billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'",

'I'll be operating at a different frequency than him \u2013 he doesn't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me.' And while Rockhold afforded Machida his respect, he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory. 'I think there is a mutual respect between Machida and me \u2013 I respect what he does,' he said. 'He's one of the best in the game and has been for a long, long time.

But at the same time, I'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate. 'I've been running marathons every day so I'm ready to go in there and chase him down.' Rockhold's last victory came against Michael Bisping last November in Australia . Machida is also coming off the back of a victory, against CB Dollaway in Brazil . Machida, meanwhile, is confident he can upset Rockhold and earn himself a title shot. 'I think if I apply my style, my technique, I can stop Luke, you know,' he said. 'If I can do my strategy, I can win the fight. 'I know there was another fight in line for the title shot - Jacare vs Yoel Romero \u2013 but now, whoever wins out of me and Luke \u2013 deserves a title shot I think. 'I can see a couple of weaknesses in Luke but it's hard to say before the fight, it's hard to foresee the fight. I have to be there to feel the fight- to see any mistakes he makes.

Webster had drugged his wife at their home in the Scottish village of Tarves, where they had settled after their wedding, before taking her for a drive. He then deliberately crashed their car and, after making his own escape, set it on fire so Claire had no hope of survival. Last year Claire's story was turned into an ITV drama starring Sheridan Smith. And now Peter has gone in front of the cameras to talk about his grief and to reveal the shocking detail of his sister's death, which he is still coming to terms with 21 years later. 'The fire brigade said it was the most intense fire they had ever seen from a mile away, the flames were leaping 20, 30 feet, it was just ridiculous,' Peter reveals on the latest episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos. 'A very brave fireman tried to retrieve what was left of Claire. There wasn't much left of her, poor love.' Peter said he was shocked and heartbroken when he was told his sister, a qualified nurse, had lost her life in just terrible circumstances. Claire and Malcolm Webster pictured on their wedding day in 1993, the following year he murdered her . He had no reason to suspect Webster, who Claire had met at a party, had drugged and then burned her alive. Claire had been besotted with him and was delighted when they tied the knot in 1993. Peter recalls: 'He seemed like the perfect gentleman which is exactly what she would have wanted. He was a sort of Colin Firth type character.' He said he and Webster consoled one another at the funeral and Peter believed he was suffering just as much as he was. 'He didn't say a lot at the funeral, he appeared to be in a complete state of shock as well,' he said. 'We were all standing round the graveside, in my right hand I was holding on to Malcolm's left hand. 'I was in floods of tears, and I looked at Malcolm, and he, he was also in floods of tears. And that more than anything else convinced me that it had been a genuine accident.' For years Peter continued to believe the car crash had been accidental, and while some officers who investigated the scene of the crash had their misgivings, they had no concrete evidence to suggest anything different. Felicity Drumm, pictured on Britain's Darkest Taboos, was Webster's second wife. He attempted to kill her in circumstances similar to Claire's death . Peter lost touch with his brother-in-law when Webster moved to New Zealand - but it was there that his true colours were revealed when he tried to murder again. He married Felicity Drumm and they had son together. Unbeknownst to Felicity, he started faking her signature to take out life insurance polices in her name and also began poisoning her like he had done to Claire. Felicity also appears on Britain's Darkest Taboos and reveals how it felt to be drugged. She said: 'These episodes would often begin with a feeling of blurred vision or double vision and unsteadiness on my feet, my speech was sometimes become a little bit slurred, I would stagger around as if I was drunk and then would fall into a deep sleep.' She couldn't believe her husband could be the cause of her illness but a pattern was forming. 'These events occurred after he had prepared a meal or a drink for me, they were always at the weekends, never inconveniently when I had to be able to go to work,' she said. Then in circumstances similar to Claire's death, in 1999 she was driven by Webster to a remote location when she was feeling tired and drowsy. It seems Webster could have been about to commit murder again - until he was interrupted by a phone call from Felicity's concerned parents. Felicity recalls how Webster was angry that the call had woken her up and urged her to ignore it but she persuaded him to drive her home so she could see her father. Webster then fled while Felicity learned some shocking truths from her parents. Webster pictured in 2011 when he was jailed for life after being found guilty of murder . 'We discovered that he'd opened up a private mail box, he had redirected all of our mail including bank mail which had prevented me from discovering that gradually the account was being fleeced,' she said. 'There were enquiries to real estate agents back in the Cornwall and Devon area suggesting he would be returning shortly to the UK with his infant son. At the bottom of his briefcase there was a total of nine life insurance policies, which collectively was in excess of a million dollars on my death, and they had my signature forged on them.' Chillingly, they also discovered a petrol canister in her car and Felicity is convinced she narrowly escaped death that day. Webster went on the run back to the UK while Felicity reported him to the New Zealand police. After investigating, they urged Scottish police to reopen the case into Claire's death. The lead officer in the case was Charles Henry. He said: 'The original fatal road accident was highly suspicious and it bore all the hallmarks of what was happening in New Zealand. At that particular point we were facing a highly dangerous individual who was a threat to any women that he was going to be with.' Felicity pictured in 2011 when she gave evidence against Webster during the trial in which he was dubbed 'the black widower' However, it would take years for the police to build a strong enough case to prove Claire's death was not an accident and gain enough evidence to charge Webster. By then, he was back living in Scotland and was planning to marry another woman who had no idea of his murderous history. In May 2011, after a long running trial during which he was dubbed 'The Black Widower', Webster was found guilty of murdering Claire, attempting to murder Felicity and attempting to bigamously marry a third woman to gain access to her estate. Now aged 55, he is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years. 'I think his sentence aptly reflects the horribleness of his crimes, and the fact that he feels no remorse, that it was all premeditated and, given the opportunity he was about to do it again,' said Felicity, who gave evidence against the father of her child at his trial. Peter, who had to wait 21 years to get justice for Claire, said he and his family can now finally move on even though their lives will never be the same again. Peter says Claire's death nearly destroyed their family but now they are rebuilding their lives . He said: 'If anything it taught me that you just have to be a little bit more cautious in life as to who you trust and when you trust them, because we could all be living next door to the next Malcolm Webster. 'It was an experience that did nearly destroy me and it nearly destroyed my family but thank God it didn't and thank God over a period of time we've managed to put the pieces back together and move on.'

Spokesman Matt Likovich says the utility discovered a stolen electric meter had been illegally connected to the rental home where the family was living since November. The utility says the meter was disconnected for safety reasons on March 25. Rodney Todd and his two sons and five daughters then used a generator for power. They were last seen alive on March 28. Scroll down for videos . Delmarva Power says it did not cut off power to a family of eight who died of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning because they were behind on their utility bills. Pictured: \u00a0Father\u00a0Rodney Todd who died . Tynijuiza Todd, 15, (left) and her 12-year-old sister Tykira (right) are died in the carbon monoxide accident . Princess Anne Police Chief Scott Keller said earlier today the Delmarva Power company has been subpoenaed to document exactly when it shut off power to the rental home. Maryland law bars utilities from terminating electric service for nonpayment of bills from November 1 through March 31 without an affidavit filed to the Public Service Commission. 'I'm just numb. I'm just numb. Like it's a nightmare but it's not,' the children's mother, Tyisha Luneice Chambers, told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'If I had known he was without electricity, I would have helped.' Court records identified the boys as Cameron and ZhiHeem, and the girls as Tyjuziana, Tykeria, Tynijuzia, TyNiah and Tybreyia. Bonnie Edwards said her grandsons were 13 and 7, and granddaughters were 15, 12, 10, 9 and 6, respectively. Eldest: Todd's eldest son Cameron, 13, is pictured with his sister, 15-year-old Tynijuiza . Birthday boy: On March 10, Todd posed for a photo with his son, 7-year-old Zycheim (left and right), saying his birthday was coming up soon . Police responding to a missing persons report found their bodies Monday after friends, school workers and Todd's supervisor at work had knocked on the door with no answer. 'The children were all in beds and it appears as though they were sleeping,' Keller said. 'They didn't have electricity. Probably it was bedtime and they decided they needed some light and probably some heat, because toward the end of March even though it was spring we were having some pretty chilly nights.' Why Todd ran the gas-powered generator inside his kitchen wasn't clear. The chief speculated that the noise would have bothered neighbors, had it been outside. Todd got some welfare money, but it wasn't enough, said Sarah Hardy, his close friend. 'How can a man survive off of basically minimum wage with seven kids, and you can't help him with a utility bill?' Hardy asked. 'This man was working. And Delmarva Power cuts the lights off?' Lloyd Edwards said his stepson had bought the generator after the power was shut off due to unpaid bills at their one-story wood frame home in the small town of Princess Anne on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Horrified: A woman looks away as bodies of the family of eight are removed from a house . Grieving: Lloyd Edwards, left, and Bonnie Edwards, the stepfather and mother of Rodney Todd stand outside the home where Todd and his seven children found dead Monday . Welfare check: Officers responded to the house in the 30500 block of Antioch Avenue after getting a call from the father's employer saying he had not shown up for work Monday morning . 'It's so hard. How can you understand something like this?' Edwards said. 'He was an outstanding dad. ... To keep his seven children warm, he bought a generator, and the carbon monoxide consumed them.' Todd got help paying utility bills in the past, but did not apply this year, said Tom VanLandingham, who directs the Office of Home Energy Programs in Somerset County. Families can apply once a year, and assistance is based on household income and energy use, among other factors. 'We're all kind of baffled as to why he did not apply this year,' VanLandingham said. 'That's the million-dollar question.' Todd retained full custody of his children when his divorce from Tyisha Luniece Chambers was finalized last September. Sheets are held as a body is removed from a residence where a gas generator in the kitchen had run out of fuel . 'The mother left, not only the seven kids by Rodney, but she left her oldest son with him as well,' Hardy said. 'She abandoned him and the kids.' Todd served 16 months behind bars for assaulting his wife in a domestic dispute, Hardy said. Upon his release, 'he came home, caught her in bed with another man, and the man was abusing the kids. He took his seven kids and her son and raised them on his own.' Chambers denied that she abandoned them, and said she had been paying child support. 'He wasn't a single parent. I was in their lives. I don't have drug problems. I love my kids and I'm sorry their father passed as well,' she said, adding that she planned to meet Todd's relatives at a funeral home on Wednesday. Bonnie Edwards said her son taught his children how to talk with elders and the value of education. He bought each a cake and a gift on their birthday, even though money was tight. 'There was nothing he wouldn't do for them,' she said. 'All he was trying to do was to keep his kids warm.' A co-worker at the nearby University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Brittney Hudson, said Todd 'was always smiling and laughing.' 'He's the man you need to know and the man you want to be,' said Bilel Smith, who lives nearby. 'They were their own football team, their own basketball team. This is breaking our hearts.' The local chief of police said his officers knew at once they will not found anyone alive inside the house .

The Prime Minister is apparently so proud to be posh he was happy to be pictured eating a hotdog with a knife and fork. The bizarre dining etiquette during a campaign visit to Dorset was almost certainly designed to avoid a repeat of Ed Miliband's disastrous attempt at eating a bacon sandwich. Scroll down for video . David Cameron ate his hotdog with cutlery as he enjoyed lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota in the sunshine during a visit to Poole in Dorset . It seems likely that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid the fate of Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was much mocked for his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year . Few people can appear attractive while eating in public, but on the campaign trail a combination of hunger and not wishing to cause offence to hosts means it can be tricky to avoid. Mr Cameron's pitstop at a garden in Poole, Dorset yesterday include a spot of a lunch. The Tory leader loaded his plate with potato salad, cucumber, tomato and a hotdog before settling down next to Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota. But he surprised onlookers with his eating style, picking up a knife and fork to chop the hotdog. The PM has a chequered history with hotdogs. In 2010 he caused offence on a visit to New York when he asked for a plain sausage, without even onions. And in March 2012 he was said to have tried eating one sideways while at a basketball game with President Obama. He also sparked a mini-storm after opting for ketchup of mustard, the condiment of choice for many Americans. The Prime Minister obviously enjoyed his lunch, and was pictured leaning back in his chair in the sunshine . In a new interview the Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing, and refuses to change the way he speaks or behaves . While aides may worry about the impression Mr Cameron gave by eating his BBQ food with cutlery, the man himself is unconcerned. In an interview to be broadcast tonight, he makes clear he is not going to change the way he behaves to hide his 'poshness'. The Old Etonian insists he has never tried to hide his privileged upbringing. He tells ITV's Tonight programme: 'I went to a very posh school, I had a very privileged upbringing with parents who were incredibly loving and brilliant. 'I've never tried to hide that, I'm not going to change my accent or talk in a different way.' In 2010 (left) Mr Cameron caused offence on a visit to New York when he asked for a plain sausage, without even onions.

'That is for people who work hard, who do the right thing. That is not for some sort of them and us economy, it is for hard working people. 'That's what I have been doing for the last four and a half years. But I accept, in politics, perceptions matter as well as reality and you have to, we've got to work harder to get that right.'",

A US air base near Kabul and military outposts in Nuristan were targeted today as the militants continue to pursue territory in north east Afghanistan. According to the official spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, over 80 per cent of Afghanistan is currently 'controlled' by the Taliban. Whilst their figures are exaggerated, the Taliban's new offensive is set to the start of fresh violence in the troubled country. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. Taliban militants opened the offensive today with a failed rocket attack on a US base in Bagram air base, situated close to the Afghan capital city of Kabul. The rocket landed harmlessly in base and despite the Taliban claims that they had 'killed and wounded hundreds of Americans', no casualties have been reported. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were also reportedly detonated in Kunar and Khost province. Casualty numbers remain unconfirmed but the attacks symbolize a worrying indicator of the broad areas being targeted by the Taliban. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces. The Taliban have been waging an jihadi insurgency since they were forced out of power in late 2001. With the emergence of ISIS, the Taliban are already facing a struggle for power in Afghanistan. The extremists want to turn Afghanistan into an Islamic Emirate, governed by strict sharia law. In December, photos emerged of a robber being publicly executed by Taliban fighters with machine guns. The Taliban announced the launch of Operation Azm, meaning 'determination', on Wednesday, revealing fresh plans to target government buildings and Afghan security forces in what is expected to be the bloodiest fighting season in a decade. With NATO forces pulling back from the frontlines, concerns remain whether trained Afghan forces will be able to consistently repel the expected barrage of Taliban attacks. 'The Islamic Emirate is going to launch the spring operations under the inspirational name of 'Azm' (Determination) at 5 am on 24th April 2015,' the Taliban said in a statement on Wednesday, using their official name. 'The main targets of these operations... will be the foreign occupiers, especially their permanent military bases... officials of the stooge regime, their military constellations, especially their intelligence, interior ministry and defence ministry officials.' Former Afghan Taliban fighters are seen holding weapons before they hand them over, as part of a government peace and reconciliation initiative, at a ceremony in Jalalabad recently. NATO's combat mission formally ended in December but a small follow-up foreign force has stayed on to train and support local security personnel. US President Barack Obama last month backpedaled on plans to shrink the US force in Afghanistan this year by nearly half, agreeing to keep the current level of 9,800 US troops until the end of 2015. The Taliban, who have waged a deadly insurgency since they were ousted from power in late 2001, said the announcement would damage any prospect of peace talks as they vowed to continue fighting. Aside from the Taliban, the Afghan government has also repeatedly warned of the Islamic State (IS) group making inroads into the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. If verified, that would mark the first major attack by the jihadists in the country. President Ashraf Ghani blamed IS for a suicide attack last Saturday in the eastern city of Jalalabad that killed 33 people and wounded more than 100 others. Afghan security forces are struggling to cope with the new offensive across Afghanistan \u00a0particularly with the gradual withdrawal of NATO forces . The upsurge in attacks has taken a heavy toll on ordinary Afghans. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the number of civilians killed and wounded up by 22 percent in 2014 compared to the previous year. In the first three months of 2015, civilian casualties from ground fighting were up eight percent on the same period last year, a new UNAMA report said. But in their statement, the Taliban said their 'top priority will be given to safeguard and protect the lives and properties of the civilian people' during the offensive.

Micheal John Duffy, 34, pleaded not guilty to murdering Colleen Deborah Ayers, 33, whose decomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property, located near Picton, south west of Sydney. In the opening statements of Duffy's trial Crown prosecutor Elizabeth Wilkins SC told the jury,\u00a0that while his former partner, Rachel Evans, had initiated the violent act, Duffy had willingly joined in. He claimed his co-accused, Evans, was the one who had a 'twisted desire to kill' and he had only helped bury Ms Ayers' body. Micheal John Duffy pleaded not guilty to killing Colleen Deborah Ayers after claiming he had only disposed of her body while his co-accused Rachel Evans was the one with a 'twisted desire to kill' Ms Wilkins told the court Evans was the one who grabbed the belt used to strangle Ms Ayers after telling a witness: 'We are going to kill her, we are going to kill her.' 'She put the belt around Ms Ayers' neck. The deceased bucked her off.' 'It was at that stage that the accused Duffy intervened and also started strangling her,' she said. 'This was Rachael Evans' idea. She was the ringleader and this accused [Duffy] joined in.' The court heard Ms Ayers had met Evans at a pub in Campbelltown only a day before she was gruesomely murdered. It is alleged on May 8, 2012, Evans and Duffy, along with a 16-year-old girl who can not be named, went to a hotel in Picton with  Ms Ayers. Evans, Duffy and Ms Ayers then proceeded to have sex with each other while the unidentified teenager filmed the act. The next day, after drinking and taking the drug ice, Ms Ayers invited the duo, along with another man, Scott Debridge, to her parents empty Lakesland property. Ms Wilkins told the court Evans and Duffy had planned to steal and sell firearms from the rural property so they could buy drugs. Courthouse: Duffy's co-accused Evans, who has plead guilty to murder, \u00a0will receive a reduced sentence for giving evidence at her former lover's trial . Later that night, after Evans had been 'cutting up' ice, she heard Duffy and Ms Ayers having sex. The 16-year-old witness said Evans became agitated and armed herself with the leather belt. The court heard Evans then entered the bedroom and started strangling the victim. It was at this point, the crown said, Duffy joined in. Ms Wilkins said once Ms Ayers was dead, Evans dragged her body into the bathroom so she could try to wash away Duffy's DNA. Meanwhile, Duffy and Debridge went to a dam on the property to dispose of the body where they dug a shallow grave and buried Ms Ayers. During his trial, Debridge claimed he tried to refuse the orders to dig the grave, however, Duffy 'bashed' him with a shovel until he continued. After Ms Ayers' body was buried the group proceeded to ransack her parents house, stealing jewellery, an Xbox and, as planned, the firearms. It is reported the group left in a maxi taxi at about 7.40am on May 10. In a chilling revelation, Evans then allegedly told the cab driver she had a 'very exhilarating night'. Ms Ayers wasn't reported missing until May 25, when her parents returned home from holidays to the Lakesland property, where their daughter's body was secretly buried. Ms Ayers'\u00a0discomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property in 2012 . Police finally caught up with Evans on May 31, after her parents spent a week wondering where their daughter could be. Evans took officers to the property and showed them where Ms Ayers was buried. She reportedly told the young witness she felt no remorse for the killing. 'I feel good. I don't feel guilty. The f***ing belt buckle snapped. When I was burying her I started hitting her with the shovel. It felt so good,' the Daily Telegraph reported. During her trial it was revealed Evans sent fan mail to infamous murderer Ivan Milat and bragged to the unidentified teen-aged witness that she would become a 'serial killer' in years to come. Evans has plead guilty to murder and Debridge to being an accessory after the fact, with both receiving discounts on their sentences for giving evidence during Duffy's continuing trial.

A voyeur who used a hidden camera to film up women's skirts as they bent over freezers in Lidl has been spared jail. James Webster targeted\u00a0female shoppers at the Lidl store in Maidenhead, Berkshire, as they hunted for bargains in the large chest freezers. The 35-year-old was caught after attracting the attention of a fellow shopper, who spotted him moving the bag he was carrying closer to his unsuspecting victim. Security guards discovered Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could carry out his covert filming. He admitted outraging public decency at a previous hearing and was warned that he could face prison. But Webster walked free from court after magistrates sitting in Slough, Berkshire, ordered him to complete a sexual offences treatment programme, as part of a three year community order. Opening the case, Helen Gambrill said: 'On January 12 the defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead and outraged the public decency, namely filming up the skirts of women in that store. 'That offence came to light when a member of the public saw the defendant and thought he was acting in a strange way.' The court heard the shopper spotted Webster positioning his satchel, with a lens protruding out, under the skirt of a woman. Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing. However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper he turned himself in to police. Webster  immediately showed remorse, telling a police officer, 'I threw the camera away in frustration on the day I did this.' He accepted that his actions had a sexual purpose but admitted he had no idea why he had carried out the crime. Francis Domingo, defending, said Webster had been struggling to deal with a break-up at the time and was incredibly ashamed at his actions. 'From the moment I've seen him, I can tell you this - Mr Webster has expressed nothing but sincere remorse over what took place,' he said. Webster, now of Fengate, Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean, the court was told. Webster had targeted women as the shopped at Lidl in Maidenhead, Berkshire (pictured) Sentencing him, Presiding magistrate Mark Lovett said: 'We note the early guilty plea and the fact that you were very upfront about it from the very beginning. 'You were remorseful for your actions. 'On the other hand, you did show obvious intention - you went equipped. This was hardly accidental.' He added: 'The other point I have to make is that you're not 18, you're 35, for goodness sake. 'That kind of action from someone of your mature years is quite extraordinary.' Webster was handed a three year community order  and was ordered to take part in a sexual offences treatment programme. He was also told to pay \u00a385 in costs and a \u00a360 fine.",

After five customers reported having 'thermal incidents', Holden issued a stop delivery notice to car dealers and urged owners of the Holden Colorado- SUV or ute- to have their cars checked out immediately. Spanning just over a year, the models said to be affected were made in Thailand between September 2013 and January 2015. After five customers reported having 'thermal incidents', Holden issued a stop delivery notice to car dealers and urged owners of the Holden Colorado- SUV or ute- to have their cars checked out immediately . This latest safety issue makes Holden the most recalled car brand in 2015. Last year, Holden shared the title of most recalls with Jeep after issuing 14 notices to recall around nine vehicles- including the Holden Barina, the Holden Cruze and the Holden TJ Trax- amid safety concerns. A website run by the federal government confirmed there is a risk 'cable insulation' in the Colorado 'may melt of catch fire.' Holden said the issue is caused by an alternator cable making unnecessary contact with a steel bracket on the battery tray. They said under certain driving conditions the movement of the engine could cause the cable to rub through the insulation, potentially causing a short circuit. This latest safety issue makes Holden the most recalled car brand in 2015, with five recalls in only four months . 'If the short circuit creates sufficient heat, there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire,' Holden told Newscorp in a statement. Holden said drivers should look out for warning signs that their car may be affected, like a battery warning light on the dash board, or in more serious cases a 'small amount of smoke' seen coming from the engine bay. Earlier this month, Holden recalled the Korean-made Captiva after concerns that the SUV may lurch forward if the key was left in the ignition for too long. This brings Holden to a total of five recalls in the first four months of this year. Holden revealed that if the short circuit creates sufficient heat, there is a risk that the cable insulation may melt or potentially catch fire (Stock photo) This comes as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced figures that show the number of safety recalls in Australia are steadily on the rise. The ACCC monitored 307 recalls in 2014,\u00a0a 14 per cent increase from 2013 where they only monitored 268 recalls. The figures show there has been a consistent increase in recalls dating back to 2010. Recalls the ACCC have monitored in Australia included a punching bag that contained nails and needles, a vacuum that put users at risk of electric shock and burns, an 'egg free' ice cream that contained egg whites and a spear gun that fired without warning. Senator Madigan, a former Democratic Labor Party representative told Farifax he blamed the rise in recalls on a 'systemic regulatory failure' to protect Australians from substandard imported products. 'There is definitely more faulty stuff around, but I do think that people are becoming a little bit more aware, and sick of it. There's a lot of these cheap places where you can go and buy cheap stuff, but it's not cheap if it doesn't last,' he warned.",

The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin. 'He got up and resumed teaching after the demo was over. Looked uncomfortable, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do,' Mubarak said.",

Hearn unveiled a cheque with his offer to Sky TV cameras in a bid to force a deal with the IBF super-bantamweight champion, as the Matchroom promoter upped the ante in a bid to book a July 18 date at Manchester Arena. However, Frampton\u2019s promoters, Cyclone Promotions, headed by former world champ Barry McGuigan, released a press release in response to the offer, claiming they were awaiting formal communication from Hearn\u2019s Matchroom Sports before renewing negotiations over the much-hyped bout. Eddie Hearn presents the cheque for \u00a31.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Matchroom Sport boss Hearn said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight . Quigg stares down the camera to tell Frampton to 'put his money where his mouth is' TV rights were believed to be a major stumbling block in negotiations as Matchroom are tied to Sky Sports, while Frampton\u2019s recent title defence against Chris Avalos attracted millions of viewers between ITV in the UK and UTV Ireland. Now Hearn has seemingly attempted to force the fight with a big-money offer in the hope that the bout can be screened on Sky Box Office. While past negotiations were believed to have collapsed due to a failure to agree a deal on future promotional \u2018options\u2019 on fights, the Matchroom promoter also insisted he has not demanded rights to promote Frampton\u2019s future fights. \u2018Nothing at all \u2014 no options, no rematch clause, absolutely nothing,\u2019 Hearn told Sportsmail when questioned on whether such terms were included in his \u00a31.5m offer. \u2018He can have this fight, he can go back to whatever broadcaster he wants [after it]. He can go and move to the moon if he wants, it\u2019s nothing to do with us.\u2019 Quigg is the defending WBA super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight Frampton in Manchester . Quigg celebrates his win over Hidenori Othake at the Liverpool Echo Arena in November last year . McGuigan declined to comment further on the saga when contacted by Sportsmail, refusing to elaborate on Cyclone Promotions\u2019 statement which said they \u2018have made several attempts to organise a follow-up meeting with Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport to progress these negotiations\u2019. The Cyclone statement added: \u2018If Matchroom Sport are interested in joining Cyclone Promotions in staging this domestic superfight, we recommend Matchroom accept the invitation for a follow-up meeting.\u2019 Hearn countered the Cyclone statement, telling Sportsmail: \u2018We just want to get it done, it\u2019s so frustrating\u2026 I know their statement said we turned down another meeting but that\u2019s because it was getting nowhere. We\u2019re trying to make things happen. \u2018The only thing that Cyclone Promotions want is they want to co-promote the show. We\u2019re bringing all the money, we\u2019re putting all the money up,\u2019 said the Matchroom promoter. \u2018If there was another broadcaster that they were willing to work with, who could throw a load of money at this fight, then make us an offer. They can\u2019t. We\u2019re in such a strong position, but we\u2019re still being fair. Scott Quigg is the one taking all the risk here. If it doesn\u2019t do that great at the box office, Scott might get only \u00a3400-500,000 and Carl still gets his \u00a31.5m, there is no risk. 'This is the offer that I believe has to make Carl Frampton say yes. I\u2019ve already responded [to Cyclone] to say \u201cif you want to co-promote, co-promote it\u201d,\u2019 added Hearn.

But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for \u00a34.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges \u00a328 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs \u00a319.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include\u00a0the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over \u00a333million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another \u00a31.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.",

Asked after the game when it was that he had decided to move the defender forward into midfield to cover the absence of Luka Modric, he replied: \u2018The minute after I found out Modric was injured\u2019. The two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night. Ramos is one of those players for whom the old Liverpool song about Jamie Carragher \u2018We all dream of a team of Carraghers\u2019 would be appropriate. He could play in every single position on the pitch. Sergio Ramos (left) celebrates with Javier Hernandez (centre) and Pepe after Real's winning goal . Ramos gees up the crowd during another all-action display at the Santiago Bernabeu for Real Madrid . It was a fiery Madrid derby on Wednesday night, but Ramos (left) once again proved his worth to Real . He often fools around in goal at Spain training. He started his Real Madrid career as a right back and won the European Championship there for his country. He has filled in at left-back, can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker. Had he been born British he would probably have grown up as a box-to-box midfielder. In Spain midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre-back and that is where he has settled. On Wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no-one down. And that\u2019s the thing about Ramos. He very rarely lets anyone down. He is Real Madrid\u2019s Carles Puyol \u2013 the all-action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the Champions League final and heads in a corner that equalises Atletico Madrid\u2019s 1-0 lead in injury time, allowing Real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy. Ramos heads away from his own penalty area, but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield . The makeshift midfielder holds off Atletico Madrid's Koke during a superb display in the middle of the park . And when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against Bayern Munich in 2010 in the Champions League semi-final when he sent his kick \u2013 at least as far as Twitter was concerned \u2013 into outer space, he has the guts to take another one in the European Championship final a couple of months later, and not only score but dink it Panenka style over the keeper\u2019s dive. He has been mocked in the past for his Colemanballs comments that usually amount to declaring himself \u2018happy with the three points\u2019 after a cup game or \u2018looking forward to the second leg\u2019 after a league game, but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him. It always seemed that even Jose Mourinho during his fall-out with Iker Casillas could never really properly fall out with Casillas' ally Ramos because there was too much about him that he admired. Ramos too, while ultimately siding with Spain team-mate Casillas, always saw the worth of a bold and proactive manager. The Spanish centre-back celebrates his crucial, last-minute goal in last year's Champions League final . Ramos has shown character to bounce back from his errors, as his penalty for Spain in 2012 showed . His supporters believe he stands for a dignity that many feel is disappearing from the game. \u2018I like managers to be nice guys but I also like them to have balls\u2019 he said of Ancelotti\u2019s decision to play him out of his usual position against Atletico. \u2018We would both have never heard the end of it had we been knocked out\u2019 he said after that 1-0 win with him deployed to win aerial duels with Mario Mandzukic who Ancelotti had noted dropped back into midfield to get on the end of Atletico keeper Jan Oblak\u2019s drop kicks. Real now have nine games left if they reach the Champions League final. Ramos will play in all of them no doubt. He may even cover for Modric again with the midfielder not back for another five weeks; he will play as an auxiliary striker if Real Madrid need a late goal, and he\u2019ll go in goal if the emergency presents itself. Someone really should teach Real Madrid supporters that song: \u2018We all dream of a team of Sergios\u2019",

But this year's Cannes Film Festival has been declared a selfie-free zone after organisers asked celebrities to stop taking the\u00a0'ridiculous and grotesque' images. While Cannes director Thierry Fremaux admitted that he did not have the powers to ban the pictures altogether, he urged movie starts to resist the temptation. Scroll down for video . Celebrities have been told to stop taking selfies at this year's Cannes Film Festival by director Thierry Fremaux (pictured, models Petra Nemcova, left, and Victoria Bonya and Hofit Golan, right, at last year's event) Mr Fremaux said that the 'ridiculous and grotesque' pictures slowed the entire event down, causing problems for organisers (pictured, Jeremie Renier takes a selfie at the photocall for Saint Laurent last year) The Cannes director blasted celebrities such as Rosario Dawson (left) and\u00a0Nabilla Benattias (right) who 'stop every two metres to take a picture of themselves, with themselves' Quoted in the Guardian, he said: 'We don't want to prohibit it but it's really a matter of timing. 'We have a certain amount of time to get people across the red carpet and up the steps and it really slows things down if people stop every two metres to take a picture of themselves, with themselves. He added: 'You never look as ugly as you do in a selfie.' Celebrities who will have to watch their selfie-taking at the 68th ceremony include Cate Blanchett, who stars in a film about lesbian love, and Michael Fassbender, who features in a film based on Shakespeare's MacBeth. Matthew McConaughey, Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and Benicio del Toro will also be welcomed to the French riviera when the event gets underway in a month's time. Mr Fremaux, director of Cannes, said he could not ban the pictures, but said celebrities will be discouraged from taking them . Mr Fremaux today announced 17 films that will be competing for prizes at the May 13-24 festival, chosen from more than 1,800 submissions. Fassbender will star opposite Marion Cotillard star in a film version of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' by Australian director Justin Kurzel. Meanwhile Blanchett stars in Carol, Todd Haynes\u2019s adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith novel about a clandestine lesbian love affair in 1950s New York. Other nominations include Jia Zhangke\u00a0'Mountains May Depart,' Paolo Sorrentino's 'Youth' - a film about age starring Michael Caine - and Gus Van Sant's forest feature 'The Sea of Trees'. Returning Cannes veterans include 'Gomorrah' director Matteo Garrone, with 'The Tale of Tales,' starring John C. Reilly and Salma Hayek; South Korea's Kore-eda Hirokazu with sibling saga 'Our Little Sister'; and France's Jacques Audiard with 'Dheepan,' the story of a Tamil refugee in France. Also in the lineup are films by Italy's Nanni Moretti and Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien. Cannes organizers have faced criticism for not selecting more films by female directors, but, or the first time in more than 25 years, this year's festival will be opened by a film by a woman. French director Emmanuelle Bercot's drama 'La Tete Haute' (Head Held High), about a teenager steered away from a life of crime by a judge. Two more female filmmakers are in competition: Valerie Donzelli with 'Marguerite and Julien' and Maiwenn with 'Mon Roi' ('My King'). Both directors are French. Geographically, the entries range from Europe to China, South Korea, the U.S. and Mexico, setting of Denis Villeneuve's narco-crime drama 'Sicario.' Ellen Degeneres set the standard for celebrity selfies at last year's Oscars ceremony when she tweeted this image, which has since be reposted 3.5million times on the social network . Mr Fremaux made the comments at a press conference announcing the films competing in the 68th Cannes festival, which feature stars including Cate Blanchett, Matthew McConaughey and\u00a0Michael Fassbender . Genres range from drama to martial-arts thriller to science fiction rom-com - in the form of 'The Lobster,' a film by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos starring Weisz and Colin Farrell. Fremaux said several more films will be added to the competition before the festival opens. Films in the lineup but not competing for prizes include Woody Allen's campus comedy 'Irrational Man,' starring Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix, George Miller's dystopian thriller 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and Asif Kapadia's documentary about the late singer Amy Winehouse, 'Amy.' Pixar, whose buoyant 'Up' opened the festival in 2009, returns with 'Inside Out,' in which an adolescent girl's thoughts and emotions become animated characters. Actress Portman makes her feature-film directorial debut with 'A Tale of Love and Darkness,' based on a memoir by Israeli writer Amos Oz. Winners of the Palme d'Or and other prizes will be chosen by a jury led by directors Joel and Ethan Coen. Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and Benicio del Toro will be among the other stars welcomed to the French riviera when the festival begins next month .",

The brothers were recently the subject of a mix-up involving Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho prior to the Blues' crunch clash with United at Stamford Bridge on April 18. Following his side's 1-0 victory over Louis van Gaal's side, Mourinho revealed he prepared his Chelsea players to deal with the threat of Fellaini all week \u2013 only to be told by a hotel doorman that the Belgian was not playing.

Following Manchester United's 3-0 loss against Everton,\u00a0Fellaini spent Tuesday chilling out with his brother . Fellaini was substituted at half-time against the Toffees as Louis van Gaal's side struggled at Goodison Park . Mourinho planned for Kurt Zouma to man mark Fellaini - with teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek playing the 6ft 4in midfielder in training. But he feared his tactical master plan was set to be for nothing when he was told that the United powerhouse was not playing by the doorman at the club's hotel. Mourinho, relaying his conversation with the doorman, said: 'Fellaini doesn't play because he was here to get tickets for the game from Eden Hazard. He was dressed in jeans, this and that'. Fellaini competes for possession with Everton midfielder Gareth Barry on Sunday . Fellaini, following a strong season in the red shirt, struggled to impose himself on the contest at Goodison . '(It) didn't smell well for me. I go to Google and I put 'Fellaini brother'. 'So I go with the pictures to the doorman. I say 'hey, this one or this one?' And he looks 'this one'. 'He's the brother'.' Mourinho said the other Fellaini - his twin brother Mansour - posed for photos as the United player, who had been in the Blues boss' thoughts all week, did start the game at Stamford Bridge.

Alison Saunders, 54, sparked outrage last week when she decided  the 86-year-old should not face a string of charges of paedophilia against nine children because he has dementia. Today, newly-released documents revealed damning evidence that abuse was covered up by police and social workers for more than 20 years. And now it has emerged Mrs Saunders' law career got off to a flying start when she secured her pupillage \u2013 a barrister\u2019s training contract at 1 Garden Court Chambers in London in 1983. It has been revealed that the country's top prosecutor Alison Saunders (right) who ruled that Lord Janner (right) would not face trial over alleged child sex abuse trained at the same legal firm where he was a QC . Last night,\u00a0The Sun\u00a0revealed that Mrs Saunders trained in the same in legal chambers where Lord Janner had practised. The Bar Council, the training body for barristers, confirmed Janner worked at the legal firm from the mid-1950s up until 1986. But a spokesperson for the CPS insisted the pair had never met, despite a three-year overlap of their time at the firm. She told MailOnline: \u2018It is common knowledge that Alison Saunders had her pupillage at Garden Court chambers. 'But the DPP and Lord Janner have never met. This is ridiculous.\u2019 The chambers were Saunders and Janner practised at 1 Garden Court was dissolved in 1989. Since then, a different and unconnected family law chambers has operated from the same address. By Richard Marsden for the Daily Mail . Alison Saunders graduated in law from Leeds University in 1982 and was called to the Bar in the following year. Her pupillage \u2013 a barrister\u2019s training contract \u2013 was at 1 Garden Court Chambers, the same offices where Lord Janner practised employment law. She joined the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, after which she shaped policy on child victims. In 2001, she became chief prosecutor for Sussex and oversaw the prosecution of paedophile Roy Whiting for the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. After a short time as deputy legal adviser to the attorney general from 2003, she returned to the CPS two years later to set up its organised crime division. In 2009, she became chief crown prosecutor for London and then Director of Public Prosecutions in November 2013. Now, the country's top prosecutor is facing calls to quit from campaigners and alleged abuse victims. Pete Saunders, director of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the revelation is 'an insult' to survivors of abuse. He told The Sun: 'On the evidence how can we not conclude that they might be covering for each other. Lord Janner (pictured after being sworn in as a Queen's Counsel in 1971) worked at Garden Court Chambers from the mid-1950s until 1986 . It is scandalous and an insult to to all the survivors who have spent decades fighting to get themselves heard.' The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 offences from 1969 and 1998. While admitting that dementia is not 'a bar' to prosecution, Mrs Saunders has defended her decision not to bring charges against Janner, adding she was surprised at the political backlash she has faced. Janner\u2019s family have issued a statement insisting he was \u2018entirely innocent of any wrongdoing\u2019 - but he has been suspended from the Labour Party. \u2018Dementia in itself isn\u2019t a bar to either a trial or to a trial of the facts, but you have to look at \u2013 and the law is very clear about this \u2013 is there a need to have a trial on the facts for the public protection?\u2019 she told the BBC. \u2018In many of the cases where we do use that procedure, it\u2019s because there\u2019s an ongoing risk to the public. Again the medical evidence was very clear in this case: there was no ongoing risk.\u2019 But her links to the shamed peer come as it emerged the judge tasked with reviewing the mistakes that prevented Janner from being brought to trial in the past was a close friend of the barrister hired to defend Janner against claims of abuse. Lord Janner turned to the late George Carman QC - who also represented paedophile Jimmy Savile - when he was first investigated in 1991. Sir Richard Henriques considered Mr Carman a mentor at the Bar, The Times reported. But Mrs Saunders has insisted that  Sir Richard's friendship with Mr Carman would have no influence on the review.",

Dave king is back on the Rangers board after being cleared by the Court of Session . Rangers players applaud as they leave the pitch following their 2-1 defeat of Hearts at the weekend .

In an interview with MailOnline, Mr Clegg said Mr Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines. The Lib Dem leader condemned David Cameron's appeal to UKIP supporters to 'come home', warning the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' which is losing all grip on the party. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed Nigel Farage's 'mask is slipping' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white 'lashing out' in a scrabble for headlines . Mr Cameron issued an appeal to people planning to vote UKIP to instead support the Tories in an attempt to block a 'toxic tie-up' between Laabiur and the SNP. But Mr Clegg condemned the 'worrying' suggestion that his former coalition partners should seek to build a majority by appealing to people on the 'far right'. Speaking in his bright yellow campaign bus as he headed to the South West, Mr Clegg: . Mr Farage has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, in an apparent attempt to generate headlines and shore up Ukip's core vote. He was condemned in the first TV leaders' debate for saying people with HIV should not be allowed into Britain and in the second for attacking the audience for being too left-wing. After criticism that the Ukip manifesto featured almost all white faces, he insisted yesterday that there was a 'half black' party spokesman featured prominently - and 'one fully black person'. The Lib Dem leader told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that the 'bandwagons of the far right' are encircling an 'increasingly hapless Conservative leadership' Miriam Gonz\u00e1lez Durantezhas been writing a food blog . Nick Clegg is such a bad cook his wife Miriam only lets him do the washing up. The Lib Dem leader admitted his 'rubbishness' in the kitchen after it emerged his wife and sons had been secretly running a food blog - MumAndSons - posting recipes and photographs online. Mr Clegg said he had played no part in the culinary operation, but had helped with taking pictures for the blog: 'I'm sure you can see my hand in a couple of them.' But his own cooking abilities do not stretch to more than peanut butter on toast. 'I'm a sort of sous chef, Mr Clegg told MailOnline. 'I provide helpful moral backing and assistance. I'll do the washing up, and tasting and preparatory tasks.' Asked if there was nothing he could cook, Mr Clegg replied: 'I'm sure I could but I'm great eater, I'm just really not a very good cook. 'If I had to, if I was starving... Peanut butter on white toast obviously, with jam on top. I'm seriously into jam on top.' Ms Gonzalez Durantez said she had run a cooking blog with her children  for three years . Mr Clegg said the comments revealed Mr Farage's true nature: 'The mask is slipping. I think the more he thrashes around to get attention the more the mask slips and the truly odious nature of his views become more and more obvious. 'This is someone who is clearly uncomfortable talking about people from different ethnic backgrounds, calls them 'half' and 'fully' black, but is also someone who advocates basically turning our backs on people who are very sick and kind of indulging in a language that is so divisive, so odious.' Mr Clegg, who boasts that the Lib Dems will win many, many more seats than UKIP on May 7, accused Mr Farage of 'running a truly incompetent campaign'. 'He is just lashing around, thrashing around, lurching from one odious gaffe or assertion to the next. There is no pattern. 'One moment he claims he wants to take his manifesto seriously and the next he is talking about fully and half black candidates. 'You are either serious or a kind of Victor Meldrew on stilts. Which one are you? 'It just beggars belief that it is that kind of person that the Conservative party thinks they need to bring back into the fold.' He said Mr Cameron's appeal to Ukip voters 'could not have been more explicit - people like Farage, please come back home'. 'I don't think the Conservative should have a home for those kind\u00a0of views,' he added. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus HQ in Filton, Bristol before travelling to Wales, said he would use the final 15 days of the campaign to tell voters of the 'danger of these kind of really odious views basically taking over or encroaching upon how a mainstream party like the Conservative party thinks and acts'. He warned that without the Lib Dems back in coalition, the Tories would be dragged to the 'extremes' by right wing backbenchers, Ukip and the DUP. He said that it is a 'tragedy' that a centrist politician like Mr Cameron had lost control of his party. 'What's happening is you are seeing the bandwagons of the far right encircling an increasingly hapless Conservative leadership. 'And the Conservative leadership will become just victim to and puppets of an array of hardline right wing voices from UKip, from DUP, from their own backbenches, which will do huge damage to our country. Huge damage. Mr Clegg, who visited the Airbus factory in Filton, Bristol today, said the Lib Dems would act as a 'bulwark' against the Tories lurching to the right . Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka' Mr Farage - appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning - has courted controversy throughout the election campaign, sparking accusations from Mr Clegg today that he was an 'odious Victor Meldrew' (pictured right) Mr Clegg claimed right wing Tories want to 'enter into coalition with Ukip, some of them want to bring back the death penalty, they want to ban the burka'. 'They have got very hardline views on people who need help from the state because they have fallen on hard times,' Mr Clegg said. 'And they take this very ideological view that basically the state and support for public services should be remorselessly cut back and cut back and cut back and cut back for no reason other than some kind of hardline ideological preference for it.' Mr Clegg went head to head with Mr Farage in two TV debates last year, ahead of the European Parliament elections, which UKip went on to win while the Lib Dems lost all but one seat in Brussels. Mr Clegg insisted most people in Britain are 'decent and pragmatic', and that the Lib Dems are most 'in tune' with public opinion. But he admitted he faces a 'challenge' to turn that into votes after a devastating collapse in popularity since entering coalition five years ago. We're the guarantee that will not let the swivel-eyed brigade take over. He added: 'We are the only bulwark, we are the only barrier, we are the only dam against this increasing pressure from people with some very, very nasty views which would lead to ideologically imposed cuts on nurseries, on schools on colleges.' David Cameron came under fire from Mr Clegg as he visited Advantage children's daycare nursery in Surbiton with London Mayor Boris Johnson . Mr Clegg said he defended Mr Farage's right to say controversial things in an open democracy, but hoped they would be defeated on Election Day. 'I really really abhor what Farage stands for but I don't begrudge the right to say what he says and seek to represent those views in Parliament.

The latest research suggests Swedish passports are among the most frequently sold in underground trading, as there is no upper limit on the number of replacements available to the rightful holder. They can sell for as much as \u00a36,000 each \u2013 far more than the \u00a328 fee that Sweden\u2019s government charges for new or renewed travel documents. Sweden's passport was among the most frequently sold travel documents on the black market . The findings are contained in a new GoEuro infographic which ranks the world\u2019s most powerful passports and takes a look at quirky facts . When placed under an ultraviolet light a Canadian passport displays colourful images on its pages, including the Parliament building in Ottawa. The Finnish passport displays a walking moose when the pages are flipped, while the cover of Belgium\u2019s passports offer three different sequences of languages, starting with Dutch, French or German. Meanwhile, the British passport is also one of the most powerful travel documents on the planet, but it doesn't come cheap. Britons have one of the most powerful passports in the world, allowing visa-free access to 174 countries . The study suggests that UK travellers are paying some of the highest passport costs in the world, with fees being far less in places such as Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, China and Russia. Research by travel website GoEuro found that the British passport is the 11th most expensive of 51 countries included in the study, and it takes a worker earning minimum wage 11 hours to pay it off. The UAE has the most affordable passport at just \u00a39, while Turkey has the most expensive at \u00a3166, said Berlin-based GoEuro. Based on its research the travel website named Sweden's passport the most powerful in the world. It allows visa-free entry into 174 countries \u2013 the same as Finland, Germany, the UK and the US \u2013 but was ranked No 1 by the website due to its cost. Swedes pay just \u00a328 for a passport, with GoEuro claiming that it takes only one hour for the average worker to pay it off. Sweden doesn\u2019t have a legal minimum wage, and salaries are determined through collective bargaining. When cost is used as the deciding factor, the UK passport is the fourth most powerful in the world \u2013 behind Sweden, Finland and Germany \u2013 with a fee of \u00a373. In Liberia, it would take a worker earning minimum wage 278 hours to pay off the country's \u00a333 passport. And it appears travellers around the world would love to get their hands on a UK passport. In a recent poll 20 per cent of those surveyed said they would choose a UK passport if they could get an extra nationality in addition to their own, even though it is one of the most expensive in the world. It was followed by passports for the US (18 per cent), Switzerland (17 per cent), Germany (10 per cent) and Canada and Australia with nine per cent each.",

There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence. Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women . The new powers, approved by Deputy Premier and Planning Minister Jackie Trad, means there is now an official and legal definition of a party house so the council can enforce laws to shut them down in certain areas. If an illegal party house is reported to the council, authorities will be able to force the owner of the property to apply for a development application. If they refuse the council can legally shut them down. Party houses are just short-term accommodation options that people regularly rent out for rowdy events like Bucks parties. Police have often been called in after neighbours complained about noise and lewd behaviour at some of the houses across the Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Mermaid Waters and Surfers Paradise areas.

There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence . Some residents who live near a party house have said they are afraid to leave their homes while a weekend-long party is raging and are tormented by the noise and activities next door. Burleigh councillor Greg Betts told the Gold Coast Bulletin the crackdown would begin this month. 'This is a planning issue which means that the criteria of what is allowed to be a party house is strict and those people operating them will have to apply to have this status,' he said. 'If they fail to get this approval but continue to operate we can shut them down.' The former state government introduced new laws last year allowing council to institute 'party house restriction areas' where short-term rental properties will be forbidden from operating.

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), before having to come back in, which he said was 'the saddest moment of my life'. But the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when White was back inside. It's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside. Had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves, they wouldn't have been able to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and would have been lost in space. And had that worse case scenario happened, it could easily have scuppered the Apollo missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969. Edward White, pictured, became the first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 June 1965. He spent 20 minutes in space, and said coming back in was 'the saddest moment of my life'. As it was the first spacewalk, there were a number of complications. White used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space . The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White.\u00a0They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. Shown is the first page of the checklist (left) and the Suit Integrity Check (right) for the spacecraft . The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. On the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft, and on the right, part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . Checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts. The spacewalk checklist for the Gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to McDivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago. The document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission. Cassandra Hatton, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the item, said: 'The Gemini 4 mission was the first time [an American] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme. Gemini 4 (pictured) launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board . Shown are astronauts Edward H. White II (left) and James A. McDivitt, command pilot for Gemini 4 . 'We knew we could get into space but until this point we didn't know if we could walk and float around out there. Jim McDivitt and Ed White's achievement is second only to landing on the moon. 'The checklist was vital for making sure things didn't go wrong and they didn't get sucked out into space. 'They had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck. There was a problem with the latch on the hatch. It was a really scary, life or death moment. 'If they hadn't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space. It would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme.' The auction takes place on April 24 in New York. The Gemini spacecraft (illustrated) was fairly cramped, leaving the astronauts little room to move around . This fantastic shot shows White floating above the curvature of Earth with the hatch seen open on the right .",

The Answer: Many of us shed a few tears over the recent Sabra hummus recall (even though we are perfectly capable of making our own at home), but that sadness quickly transformed into anxiety when we looked inside our refrigerators and saw the potentially tainted culprit sitting there on the shelf. To assuage any fears, we asked John Swartzberg, M.D., a clinical professor at the University of California at Berkeley, to walk us through the process of determining if our favorite dip was still safe to eat. Related: Amy's Kitchen Recalls More Than 70,000 Cases Of Food Due To Fear Of Listeria Contamination . The first step, according to Swartzberg, is to go to the Food and Drug Administration's website and find the official report for the recalled product you're worried about. Each report will list recalled items with their product codes, which are typically categorized by the Universal Product Code (the number adjacent to the barcode) or the Stock Keeping Unit (a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold). They will also include the recalled products' use-by dates, and the geographical areas affected. \"The recall is not based on the use-by dates, though,\" said Swartzberg. \"If the product is within the use-by date, it should still be recalled. This makes sense, because the product was contaminated prior to purchase and no matter how 'fresh' the product is, it still may be contaminated.\" After cross-checking these details, you should have a strong sense of whether your food product is safe to eat or needs to be trashed right away. But as far as avoiding potential problems before learning such details about a food recall, the consumer is at an automatic disadvantage. Related: 14 Habits Of People With A Healthy Relationship To Food . \"There's nothing the consumer can do prior to learning about the recall,\" said Dr. Swartzberg. \"Discarding or returning the product to the store is all that can be done.\" In the case of this specific hummus recall, while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness, the product's routine sample last month revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Consuming such bacteria can lead to listeriosis, a serious infection, and Dr. Swartzberg recommends that anyone who has consumed a listeria-laden food should let their physician know as soon as possible. \"Listeria survives well at cool temperatures,\" he said. \"Most bacteria and fungi do not -- that's why we refrigerate. Healthy people are at low risk for disease, but it can happen. Those at greatest risk for disease are the elderly, immunocompromised and pregnant.\" To learn more about the best food safety practices, visit UC Berkeley's Wellness website.

It is a painful and embarrassing condition that affects millions of British women. Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth. Complications include an uncomfortable dragging or \u2018full\u2019 feeling, discomfort during sex or stress incontinence. Although up to half of women are thought to suffer to some degree, far fewer seek help, and many who do are offered just one solution: a hysterectomy. While surgical removal of the reproductive organs solves the immediate problem, it also ends fertility, and with three months of recovery needed, it is no quick fix. Now, a leading gynaecologist has claimed thousands of patients may be undergoing the drastic operation needlessly. He is one of a growing number of surgeons who claim not enough women are offered the alternative: a half-hour keyhole procedure that uses an implanted mesh \u2018sling\u2019 made from nylon to lift and hold the womb back in place, providing a permanent solution to a prolapse and preserving fertility. The procedure, called a sacrohysteropexy, is rare, with just 1,072 admissions for the surgery in the past three years. By contrast, there were 145,310 admissions to hospitals in England in the past three years for hysterectomies due to conditions such as fibroids, pelvic pain or cancer, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Surgeon Jonathan Broome, who has performed more than 1,000 sacrohysteropexies in the past 15 years, has called for the option to be made more widely available on the NHS so women of child-bearing age are not forced to choose between quality of life or the chance to have children. \u2018Most women requiring surgery for a prolapse will be referred for a hysterectomy by their GP,\u2019 says Mr Broome, who performs the \u00a34,000 procedure for both NHS and private patients at hospitals in Lancashire and Greater Manchester. \u2018That means some women are faced with the dilemma of living a normal life without a prolapse, or the possibility of having children. 'Far too many GPs recommend hysterectomies as the solution to a prolapse, when a sacrohysteropexy is a much better alternative. It\u2019s a shorter operation, with shorter recovery time because it is less invasive, and fertility is not put at risk.\u2019 Pelvic organ prolapse, or POP, occurs when tissue supporting the pelvic organs \u2013 including the womb \u2013 becomes weak, typically after childbirth (file image) Common causes of prolapse include childbirth, lower levels of oestrogen at menopause, being overweight and chronic illnesses such as lung diseases, which create pressure inside the abdomen from coughing. Half of women over 50 will have symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and more than one in ten will have had surgery for the problem by the age of 80. Concerns have been raised about the use of mesh implants in gynaecological procedures, with some women in Scotland and the US complaining of problems including bleeding and infections. But consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones says the risk of complications where mesh is inserted abdominally is very small. Medical watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has received two reports of adverse incidents relating to a sacrohysteropexy since 2011. \u25cfA sacrohysteropexy is keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic to put the womb back into its normal position. \u25cfTiny cuts are made in the stomach through which a telescope and instruments are passed. \u25cfA piece of mesh is inserted via an incision along the bikini line. Using tiny needles, one end of the mesh is attached to the back of the cervix and the other to the coccyx, and it is fixed with metal staples. The mesh is also covered with a thin layer of tissue to prevent scar tissue forming, encouraging the tissue to grow and make the repair stronger. \u25cfIt can stay in place indefinitely and does not require a repeat operation. \u25cfThe procedure takes half an hour and involves an overnight stay in hospital. Mr Spence-Jones agrees that too many women are given the wrong advice on what surgery is right for them. \u2018There seems to be a notion in general practice that taking everything \u2013 in other words, a hysterectomy \u2013 is the answer to a prolapse, when that isn\u2019t the case,\u2019 he says. \u2018Sparing the fertility is a reason for considering procedures other than a hysterectomy, but not the only one.\u2019 One woman who says her life has been transformed by a sacrohysteropexy is 44-year-old mother- of-two Karen Bane, from Lancashire. She suffered feelings of bloatedness following the birth of her daughters Gabrielle, seven, and Jessica, five. \u2018I felt sluggish \u2013 I had back pain, sitting was uncomfortable and intercourse was painful. I\u2019d also started to have leakage. It was mortifying being a woman in my early 40s and not being able to control my bladder. \u2018I put up with the symptoms for five years, but when I started to have bleeding, I knew enough was enough. I was a mother of two young children, yet all I could see were years of misery in front of me.\u2019 Karen went to her GP with her symptoms in May 2014 and was referred to Mr Broome. He performed the procedure at Euxton Hall Hospital in Chorley, Lancashire, last October. Karen says the procedure has given her a new lease of life. \u2018I can run, skip and hula-hoop with my daughters without giving it a second thought,\u2019 she explains. \u2018I feel so much more feminine since my operation \u2013 my only battle scars are tiny nicks on my stomach. And because I had a sacrohysteropexy rather than a hysterectomy, everything is still there. It\u2019s not something we are planning to do as we feel our family is complete, but the chance to have another child has not been taken away from me.\u2019 Why should I take... Creatine . Creatine is a compound found in muscle tissue that increases the body\u2019s ability to produce energy, and is often used by athletes to boost performance during high-intensity exercise. But there is evidence that taking 5g of creatine daily can deliver a short-term boost to brain power. An Australian study involving 45 volunteers found that those who took creatine for six weeks performed better in IQ and memory tests than those who were given a placebo.

Can you smell when it's going to rain? Professor Barry Smith, founder of the Centre for the Study of the Senses at the University of London, says: \u2018Yes you can. Air pressure falls and humidity increases when it is about to rain, and our noses act like a barometer, picking up these subtle changes in the air. \u2018Humidity makes smells more intense. The smell gets stronger still when rain starts to fall, as droplets of water will pick up molecules from the surface they hit \u2013 such as grass or dirt \u2013 and carry them into the air.\u2019",

It is perhaps fitting that Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots. Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance\u00e9 at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Juntion prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Old neighborhood: Cedar Junction is about a mile and a half away from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play tight end for the New England Patriots . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home. New home: Hernandez is starting his sentence at maximum-security prison MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (pictured above) Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts (pictured above . They then post for a new mugshot and are fingerprinted before sitting in a special chair that scans their bodies for possible hidden objects. All new inmates receive a paper bag containing seven pairs of underwear and a specially-designed razor and pen that can't be used as a weapon. Jerry-rigged weapons are something Hernandez should be concerned with, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hogson. Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said. Labor: Workers at Cedar Junction's prison manufacture license plates for 50 cents an hour - a far cry from the $40million contract extension Hernandez received from the Patriots in 2012 . The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma. And for a former professional athlete who's used to eating large satisfying meals, Hernandez may lose his appetite in the cafeteria where the food was once described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Cedar Point is where all male inmates are booked when they start their sentences in Massachusetts, so Hernandez will eventually be moved to another facility in the coming weeks or months, . It's reported that he will be sent to Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts next.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nTokyo (CNN)With the world watching, in his historic address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress, the first ever by a Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history. During this 70th year anniversary of the end of World War II, Abe has been disappointing on Japan's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for Japan's wartime actions in Asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive. And this \"Abenesia\" is harmful to Japan's international image, riles China and South Korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda. Washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for Abe because the Obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with Tokyo that contemporary China is a threat requiring a collective response. Strengthening the alliance with Japan and sealing the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trumps past misdeeds. Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, America is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds. President Barack Obama pulled out all the stops to give Abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling Washington's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined. But the newly expanded security role embraced by Japan enjoys little support among Japanese. As a recent Pew Poll indicates, only 23% are in favor while 68% are opposed. It is also problematic that Abe's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with South Korea, something the U.S. sees as essential. Carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience, Abe hit the right notes in many respects, and even inched forward on history.  He did express \"eternal condolences\" about the loss of American lives in World War II, and noted, \"Enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit.\" That is welcome news, but Japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies, precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past. Many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories, but Abe is mounting a significant retreat from Japan's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s, and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education. He is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship. Of course there is nothing that Abe could say that would satisfy China or South Korea, two nations that suffered longest and most from Japanese depredations from the late 19th century. But that doesn't mean he shouldn't try a bit harder. What Abe said is, \"Post war, we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war. Our actions brought suffering to the peoples in Asian countries. We must not avert our eyes from that. I will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard.\" Essentially outsourcing \"apology and war responsibility\" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale. It is also troubling that throughout his political career, Abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous Mea Culpa. Rather than merely \"upholding\" what others have said it might have been better for Abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology. In Japan, there has been a lot of pressure on Abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 Murayama Statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility. Even the conservative Yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so. Murayama clearly condemned \"mistaken national policy,\" \"self-righteous nationalism,\" \"colonial rule\" and \"aggression,\" but Abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called \"masochistic\" view of Japan's wartime history. Fatalistically, Abe said, \"History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone.\" Well, yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies, acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates Japan in East Asia. Abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering Japan on the anvil of history, but they were handed the hammer by Japan. Given Abe's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery, a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards. What Abe managed, however, was even weaker than expected: \"Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most. In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses.\" This cavalier \"sh*t happens\" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines Japan's dignity and represents a step backward. In recent remarks Abe says he upholds the 1993 Kono statement, but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment. Moreover, Abe's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools, contravening what the Kono statement promised. In the only textbook that does mention them, the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence. To counter criticism, Abe now refers to Japan's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking, a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns. Human trafficking, however, highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the Japanese military and government authorities of the day. Revisionists prefer to blame the Korean brokers, but they were acting at the behest of Japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell. In his speech Abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom. This too is welcome news because over the past year Abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the Asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system, packed NHK's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs. Indeed the New York Times ran an article on April 26 implicating Team Abe in the axing of a prominent TV pundit who made the mistake of criticizing Abe. The foreign press has also exposed Japanese government harassment targeting their reporting, especially regarding the whitewashing of history, and attempts to smear the integrity of those who wouldn't go along. In addition, journalists were told not to interview certain Abe critics. Journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in Japan for some time, but under Abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier. Abe got lots of applause from U.S. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an \"alliance of hope.\" That's not exactly how Okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear. Some 75% of U.S. bases are concentrated in Okinawa and U.S. bases cover nearly 20% of the land. In a series of elections and in opinion polls, Okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation. In November 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the U.S. in the pristine waters of Oura Bay in northern Okinawa, kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project. Officials on both sides of the Pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Okinawa, but Okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored.

The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs . Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ . While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as\u00a0North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem .",

The game was twice delayed early on when Kevin Locke for Salford and Huddersfield's Brett Ferres were carried off injured. Griffin opened the scoring on 21 minutes when he pounced on a mistake by Huddersfield's Jermaine McGillvary. The winger seemed set to grab a grubber kick into the left corner by Jones-Bishop - but when he slipped in the in-goal area Griffin was there to score. He failed to convert but was on target 10 minutes later after Jones-Bishop took advantage of more slack defending. Rangi Chase kicked through straight from a scrum and Jones-Bishop got to the ball first despite several Giants players being better placed. Lacklustre Huddersfield, seeking a fifth straight win, woke up after that and were back in the contest on 38 minutes. On-loan Wigan forward Hughes went over from Jamie Ellis' pass after good work by Eorl Crabtree. There was a flare-up on half-time when Crabtree and Weller Hauraki came to blows after the Kiwi made a heavy tackle on the England international. Salford extended their 10-6 half-time lead on 55 minutes when Forster grabbed his first try of the season. Griffin, the older brother of fellow former Huddersfield player Darrell, who was on the bench for this match, converted. Hauraki was put on report on 62 minutes for a bad tackle which left Giants full-back Scott Grix needing treatment. Murphy then went over in the right corner on 76 minutes for his fourth try in as many games. Brough added the extras to leave the home side a converted try away from a late victory. But soon after they were punished for interfering with play and Griffin kicked the resulting penalty. Solid defending, including forcing Huddersfield to play out a set of six around their own 10-metre line, helped Salford see the game out.",

Bullock, 50, joins a long line of actresses to receive the honor, including last year's cover girl, Lupita Nyong'o, and Gwyneth Paltrow in 2013. She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing \"ridiculous.\" \"Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' \" she told People. \"No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying.\" The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. \"I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in,\" she said. \"And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' \" The Oscar-winning star of movies including \"Gravity,\" \"The Blind Side\" and \"Crash\" said she's happy with who she is. \"As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see.\" The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. \"Great choice! Gorgeous, talented, over 50 and FABULOUS! That's the way it's done!\" wrote one fan on People's Facebook page. Also making the \"most beautiful\" cut this year: Gabrielle Union, Ariana Grande and Laverne Cox. The issue hits newsstands Friday.",

According to Omaha.com, Jenkins told his attorney about the incident in a phone call from his cell in Omaha, Nebraska. It comes amid the 28-year-old's ongoing appeal that he is mentally unstable and therefore ineligible to face the death penalty. Jenkins was jailed exactly one year ago for shooting dead four people in 10 days after being released from prison. During his murder trial in Douglas County, Jenkins was assessed by a doctor who concluded that he was 'a psychopath' and 'one of the most dangerous people' he had ever encountered.

The decision of whether he would be sentenced to death was delayed after Jenkins revealed he had carved a swastika into his skin. Following months of delays, he will face a panel in July to decide his fate.

'A few people often hang out there and drop things like food and so on, so the dogs like to go scavenging around that area. 'He came back in the house and lay down and was tired as you might expect. 'But then he got up and started running around, doing laps of the room as if he was being chased. The bus stop in\u00a0Leintwardine, Shorpshire, where Twiglet found and consumed the unidentified narcotics . After  drooling at the mouth uncontrollably, shaking and walking into walls he seems to be back to normal . 'He had his tail between his legs and his head down, which he only does when he is being chased around by our other dogs. 'When I got hold of him he started shaking uncontrollably, producing huge quantities of saliva and panting excessively. 'He then lost his balance on the laminate flooring and fell onto his side. 'My wife was obviously quite upset. She's never seen a dog go through anything neurological before. Let alone tripping on drugs. 'I just reacted instinctively and had to treat him like any client's dog. I took step back and tried to remain calm.' Because of Twiglet's symptoms Mr Fisher believes his dog may have ingested something hallucinogenic . The father-of-one said he phoned the nurse at his surgery in Ludlow, Shropshire, to come and take a blood sample and made Twiglet vomit. The blood test did not show any obvious medical cause but a veterinary neurologist believed the illness to have been caused by narcotics. He added: 'The next day he was completely back to normal - although his eyes were very red. 'I've got a friend who is a neurologist so I asked them what they thought it was. 'Because of the circumstances and symptoms they suggested it sounded like he'd ingested something hallucinogenic. 'For a dog with no history of having any neurological issues to behave like this for a short period is usually related to drugs. Twiglet's scavenging days would appear to be over following the unfortunate incident last week . 'He would have been quite an unlucky dog to have had all those symptoms and for it to be anything else. 'It's not a common diagnosis around our village but there is a bit of a hippie commune up the road. Maybe something was dropped or had fallen out of someone's pocket. 'I have only seen one similar case in which we found a dog had swallowed a bag of marijuana - we just want other owners to be careful in future.' Wife Karen, 33, a farm consultant, added: 'It led to a 45 minute episode in which Twiglet showed symptoms of being under the influence of narcotics. 'Symptoms include hallucinating, partial seizures, tremors, hyper salivating, in-coordination and collapsing. 'We want to make other owners aware to be vigilant when walking their dogs in the area.' The vet is urging dog owners to be vigilant while walking pets in the area in case a similar incident occurs .",

It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation. 'I want to reinforce the message that you should be abiding by directions, if the train station is closed, you don't climb over onto railway tracks, It is a shame that people have taken it upon themselves to do so on this occasion.'",

The appalling conditions of a dog training centre where illegal pitbulls covered in scars were forced to wear electric shock collars and train on treadmills has been caught in shocking footage . RSPCA officers discovered the five illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs at a make-shift farm in Lancashire where they had been brutally trained to take part in illegal dog fights .

All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed. Darren Wheatcroft pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan, and farmer Simon Whitworth pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting. All three were handed suspended prison sentences and ordered to pay a total of \u00a340,000 to the RSPCA at Burnley Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" Jama said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack . In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

Last week he won his 50th cap at the age of 27 and was immensely proud of his achievement. And his club may need his leadership now. At the Etihad Stadium two weeks ago there was a distinct lack of fervour despite the 3-0 win over West Brom, as though a certain kind of resignation has set in regarding Manchester City\u2019s trajectory but Hart does not accept that. \u2018We\u2019ve proved it and the fans have proved it \u2013 we never give up,\u2019 he said. \u2018That is one thing that is part of Manchester City that we\u2019ve taken with us from the olden days. We\u2019ll never give up while anything is possible. We\u2019ll go for it. \u2018We have definitely moved on as a team since we first won the league in 2012. That was a massive achievement but now we expect it of ourselves. We have been disappointed at certain times this season but there are eight games to go and we\u2019ll give it all we\u2019ve got.\u2019 Hart himself is a good example of the adage that one should never give in. Dropped last season by Manuel Pellegrini and threatened this season by the \u00a36million signing of Willy Caballero, Hart is playing as well as ever, his penalty save against Lionel Messi and the subsequent performance at the Nou Camp a product of a long period of good form. Hart has proven his class after being dropped last season following a handful of mistakes . \u2018I feel pushed,\u2019 said Hart. \u2018I have personal pride. I push myself personally. I think the world of Willy. I think he is a fantastic goalkeeper and I know full well that if my standards drop, Willy will be in goal. That is how it is at Manchester City. That is how it is with England. I know it is the same thing here. I need to be on my toes and performing at a high level otherwise someone takes your spot.\u2019 And Hart is not content with game, striving to better himself. \u2018I can improve everything, management of the game. But I want to improve on everything and don't just say that lightly. I look at everything I do. You don\u2019t set limits. I want to keep going and keep pushing and keep my place in the two teams I\u2019m with \u2013 Manchester City and England. I hope the best is to come. That is what I\u2019ll be pushing to do. \u2018Every game is a rescheduled goal for me. It genuinely is. I\u2019ve enjoyed the two games with England but I turn my head to Palace now. That is the next game for me and the one I\u2019m looking forward to.\u2019 Hart labelled Buffon, who won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, a 'legend of the game' And if he needed any inspiration in that quarter, a look across to his opposite number on Tuesday night at the Juventus Stadium would have provided it. As Hart won that 50th cap for England, Gianluigi Buffon was winning his 147th at the age of 37 and proving as sharp as ever. The England goalkeeper is a fan. \u2018It\u2019s hard to look past Buffon. He\u2019s absolutely amazing. What a keeper \u2013 147 caps, countless titles, the World Cup, European trophies. What a goalkeeper and what a gentleman. He\u2019s real idol of mine and it\u2019s a real privilege to share a pitch with him. \u2018I\u2019ve got a long way to go. But to see people like that at the top level is a real good feeling. I like him. I\u2019ve watched his career and how he is around people. It\u2019s a small amount of time you spend with people when you are in the tunnel with them but he oozes class. 'He is a classy guy and it\u2019s great to have an icon like that. Fraser Forster played against Juventus a few times and said the same thing.\u2019 Only in one area will Hart not be emulating Buffon. With his designer stubble, flowing hair, and his silk waist coat and designer shirt, Buffon looked a little more like a successful artist or film-maker than a footballer as he left the Juventus stadium. \u2018He does look cool,\u2019 said Hart, with a degree of self deprecation. \u2018I\u2019ll never try to be him. With my mousey blonde hair, it wouldn\u2019t really work.\u2019",

Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers because of restrictions that will squeeze profits. The company has also warned existing customers that the loyalty points they earn will be much lower from June 1. Financial experts believe other firms are likely to follow suit. Capital One yesterday became the first provider to scrap its cashback offer for new customers after the announcement of an EU cap limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments (file photo) The company scrapped the deal after the announcement last month of an EU cap \u2013 due to be introduced in October \u2013 limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments. Capital One said it made perks 'no longer sustainable'. Kevin Mountford, of price comparison website MoneySupermarket, told the Daily Telegraph: 'This is a classic case of regulators, in this case European, trying to act with the consumer in mind, only for the policy to come back to bite the very people it was supposed to help. 'Its new rules won't just hit cashback cards, all loyalty programmes are at risk because something will have to give when card companies are squeezed.' Last month, the European Parliament voted in favour of a cap at 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. The cap will apply to all purchases paid for with a card in the EU \u2013 either abroad or on the internet. Several credit card companies \u2013 including American Express, Barclaycard, and Santander \u2013 have millions of customers who earn hundreds of pounds or free flights if they clear their debts every month. Capital One, which pays card-holders 5p for every \u00a31 cleared, has written to customers warning that the amount they earn will be much lower from June 1. Last month, the European Parliament voted in favour of a cap at 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards (file photo) It said that fees paid by merchants such as shops and restaurants to accept cards are being reduced, and it was these fees which had funded their cashback. It said it would not be increasing fees or charges as a result of the changes. Rachel Springall, of financial information website Moneyfacts, said: 'The changes from Capital One could be the starting point for a change to reward schemes because of the new ruling on interchange fees. 'Instead of adding on card fees, providers will be looking at other ways to re-coup their costs and one of the ways to do this is to withdraw reward schemes or interest-free offers.\u00a0All it takes is for one provider to start the ball rolling before others do the same.'",

The intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester, by builders who were renovating the property. Oblivious to its true value and historical significance, the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers. The four-poster oak wood bed (above), which was dumped in the car park of Redland House Hotel in Chester and later sold at auction for \u00a32,200, has now been confirmed by DNA as once belonging to King Henry VII . The intricately-carved bed was left in the car park of the former hotel by builders who were renovating the property and, oblivious to its true value and historical significance,  left it to be picked up by auctioneers . It was snapped up for \u00a32,200 in 2010 by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland who spotted the item, which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival, on the internet. However, he was shocked when his new 'Victorian' purchase arrived and approached TV historian Jonathan Foyle with a suspicion that the bed was, in fact, the only surviving Tudor bed. Since then, Mr Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII. He said tests confirmed it was European oak and of a sub-species 'typical of the origin of the finest, slow-grown oak imported by the medieval elites', with analysis of the historic paintwork proving its age. 'Under the varnish, traces of late medieval decoration have been found,' he said. He has traced it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire to see the Stanley family, who had helped him to victory in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Mr Foyle said DNA from the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII (pictured) and he traced\u00a0it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire.  Henry VIII may have been conceived in the bed . The bed was snapped up by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland,\u00a0for \u00a32,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former\u00a0Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester (above) TV historian Jonathan Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to King Henry VII . He also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch. The carving also features biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility, such as acorns, bunches of grapes and strawberries. Meanwhile, scribblings in a Victorian furniture restorer's diary suggested that the bed was at Lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644. Mr Foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of Victorian revivalists by reflecting on the Tudors' belief that they had been chosen by God to save England from civil war. The bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch . The bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . He said the headboard showed Henry VII and his bride as Adam and Eve transmuted into Christ - adding: 'It's arguably the cradle of the English Reformation. Henry VIII may have been conceived in bed . The carved four-poster bed, which has been revealed as Henry VIIs, was reportedly created for the marriage of the first Tudor King and his wife, Elizabeth of York, on January 18, 1486. It is highly likely that the couple's son, Henry, was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Born at Greenwich Palace in 1491, Henry VIII was the third child and second son of Henry VII and his wife. Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 April, 1509. Under Henry VIII's reign, England turned in favour of Protestantism and split from Rome, the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded France. Jonathan Foyle, chief executive of World Monuments Fund Britain, said: 'This bed belonged to Henry VIII. It has to be the most important piece of furniture [in England' - and arguably, royal artefact.' He added: 'Even the Westminster coronation chair has less to say than this.' Experts believe Henry VII may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son. 'Look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of Christ and Mary; it's Henry VIII's God complex in a nutshell.' Dr Foyle described the 15th Century artefact, which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in England, as 'a complete national treasure'. He added: 'Evidence suggests the bed was made for the Painted Chamber of Westminster Palace for the marriage ceremony at Westminster Abbey on January 18, 1486.' Mr Foyle is backed by other experts, such as Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, who described the rediscovery as 'exceptionally important'. The medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to \u00a320million, although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display. It is part of the 'A Bed of Roses' exhibition at the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, at Hever Castle in Kent which also features a portrait of Henry VIII as a young man. The bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in England. In 2013, the battle-scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in Leicester. Meanwhile, in December of the same year, archaeologists uncovered a site in the Amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of Atahualpa, the last emporer of the Incas. And last year, explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to Alfred the Great in the grounds of Hyde Abbey in Winchester. Henry VII's four-poster bed will remain on display in the Long Gallery at Hever Castle in Kent until November 22.",

Both players have been hugely influential since they moved to London in the summer of 2012, but who has been the most exciting import to watch? Here, Sportsmail's reporters choose the player they most enjoy seeing in action. Eden Hazard (L) and Santi Cazorla are both set to make their 100th Premier League appearance this weekend . Lee Clayton . Cazorla has wonderful balance. So does Hazard. Cazorla scores important goals. So does Hazard. Cazorla is two-footed. So is Hazard. Cazorla dances past opponents. So does Hazard. So, while there is not a lot to choose between them and Hazard is likely to get the most picks in this article, I am going for Cazorla. It's a personal choice. He is a wonderful footballer. I have paid to watch them both (and I will pay to watch them both again), but the little Spanish magician edges it for me. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla, pictured in action against Burnley, has been an influential part of Arsenal's midfield this season . Ian Ladyman . I remember when Manchester City baulked at paying Hazard's wages when the Belgian was up for grabs in 2012. Back then City thought the young forward had a rather high opinion of his own worth for a player who was yet to play in a major European league. In the early days of his time at Chelsea, it looked as though City may have been right. He showed flashes of brilliance but also looked rather too easy to push off the ball. Roll forward to 2015, however, and the 24-year-old has developed in to one of the most important players in the Barclays Premier League. Brave, strong and ambitious, Hazard plays on the front foot and with only one thought in this mind. Rather like Cristiano Ronaldo, he has also developed in to the type of player ever defender hates, simply because he gets back up every time he is knocked to the ground. He would get in every team in the Premier League and is one of the reasons Chelsea will win the title this season. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge . Dominic King . It has to be Hazard. I saw him play for Lille twice in the season before he joined Chelsea \u2013 once against St Etienne, the other was what proved to be his final appearance against Nancy. He scored two in the first match, a hat-trick the latter and played a different game to those around him. He hasn't disappointed since arriving here and I love the nonchalance with which he takes a penalty, his low centre of gravity and the way he can bamboozle defenders. If there is such a thing as \u00a332million bargain, it is Hazard. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win against Hull in March . Nick Harris . Now this is a tricky one because while Eden Hazard will frequently embark on a dribble or dink in a pass that will make you nod in appreciation, he'll also miss a penalty and make you groan. Whereas the older Cazorla, less flashy but no less of a technical master, is to my mind more of a fulcrum, more important relatively to the sum of Arsenal's parts than Hazard is to Chelsea. You'll gasp at Hazard but Cazorla's wow factor is richer. That's not to dismiss either: both are brilliant footballers, contributing goals, assists and flair. Any neutral would bite your hand off to have either playing in your team. Forced to pick though, it's Cazorla, for his consistency and crucially doing it in the biggest games. Exhibit A would be Manchester City 0 Arsenal 2 in January; goal, assist, all-round brilliance, against a big team, at an important time. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla scores from the penalty spot in Arsena's 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January . Riath Al-Samarrai . Eden Hazard for me. Cazorla is an utter delight, a little pinball of a man who is probably the most two-footed player I've seen. Put him in a tight space and then you see what makes him rare among the best. But Hazard is the top player in the Premier League, in my opinion. This is the sixth of his eight seasons as a professional where he has reached double figures and yet he offers so much more than goals (36 in 99 in the Premier League for Chelsea). He can beat a man and, better still, you sense he likes doing it. Technically, his passing and shooting are excellent and he also has a mind capable of sussing out the shapes and systems in front of him. That intelligence, more specifically his speed of thought, is probably what makes separates the good from the brilliant. A complete player who doesn't yet seem to have the complete ego. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard gets away from Manchester City duo Fernando (left) and Martin Demichelis at Stamford Bridge . Laurie Whitwell . Has to be Hazard for me. The way he carries the ball through ever tightening spaces and emerges the other side is a joy. Like one of those Indiana Jones impossible escapes from a sliding door or rolling boulder. And his penalties are mesmeric. I could watch them again and again not working out how he does it. VERDICT: HAZARD . Belgium international Hazard scores a header past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian at Upton Park . Sami Mokbel . Both are marvellous players, but I could watch Santi Cazorla all day. When he first arrived in England I remember, whilst sitting in the Upton Park press box, trying to work out whether he was left or right footed. He was wonderful that day as Arsenal cruised to a 3-1 win; it was one of the most complete performances I've seen live. In truth, I've still got no idea whether he's left or right footed. He's that natural on either. Hazard is a phenomenon, but aesthetically no on can touch Cazorla in the Premier League. VERDICT: CAZORLA . Cazorla grins after scoring Arsenal's fourth goal against Aston Villa at the Emirates in February . Jack Gaughan . From a purely artistic sense, Santi Cazorla is probably the most graceful individual on the ball in the entire Premier League. But Eden Hazard provides moments to really stick in the memory. He glides past opponents effortlessly and regularly chips in with important goals - plenty of them stunning in their execution. Worth the ticket alone. The one blot from Cazorla's point of view is that his genius can be fleeting. VERDICT: HAZARD . Sam Cunningham . Jose Mourinho has told him to add more goals to his game to move on a par with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and, three years younger than the Argentine and six than the Portuguese, he is not far from doing that. I've watched Hazard countless times at Stamford Bridge this season and he makes the game seem like an art form with his movement, dribbling and passing. Cazorla can excite at times, but he is nowhere near consistently reaching Hazard's level. For me there is no contest between the pair. VERDICT: HAZARD . Hazard tucks home yet another penalty during Chelsea 2-1 win against Stoke City last weekend . Craig Hope . I would far rather have Hazard in my team, but I can't help but feel the excitement has been stripped from him under Jose Mourinho. Efficient, technically brilliant, effective and hard-working he most certainly is - and he will be crowned PFA Player of the Year - but he is no longer the daring dribbler of whom we heard so much about during his teenage years in France. He is, though, arguably a better player for Mourinho's influence. Cazorla, meanwhile, would never thrive under Mourinho, there is too much of Juan Mata about him. But there is no doubt he is thrilling to watch on his day - it's just a shame those days aren't as frequent as they should be for a player of his calibre. VERDICT: HAZARD . RESULT: HAZARD 7-3 CAZORLA . Hazard has been voted as a more exciting player than Cazorla in Sportsmail's survey .",

And now research is under way to find out why, with scientists proposing that climate change may have caused the surge in numbers. Common dolphins were once a rare sight in the Hebrides, preferring warmer waters found further south, leading experts to believe that global warming has led to pods moving north. Encounters with common dolphins (a stock image is shown) off the west of Scotland have more than doubled over a decade, according to a leading research body.\u00a0Monitoring by Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust teams has seen the number of encounters increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years . Monitoring by Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust teams has seen the number of encounters with common dolphins increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years. The dolphins come to the Hebrides in spring to take advantage of seasonal food stocks, travelling in large groups and sometimes forming \u2018super-pods\u2019 of thousands of individuals. The species, which are smaller than the area\u2019s resident bottlenose dolphins, often approach boats and play in the wake, the trust said. While they were once drawn to warmer waters above 10\u00b0C south of the area, climate change is  causing sea surface temperatures in the Hebrides to rise by around 0.5 \u00b0C a decade. And warmer water species appear to be colonising new areas further north or closer to shore, the trust said. The dolphins are moving further north than they did decades ago, possibly because the water has become warmer. While the shift could create new feeding opportunities for the common dolphins, it could increase competition between other types of dolphin or seabirds. An Oystercatcher on the Isle of Mull is shown . The shift north could be creating new opportunities for the common dolphins to find food in new areas, but may mean the species is competing for fish with other types of dolphin or seabirds. Volunteers will live, work and sleep on Silurian research ship for up to 12 days. They will receiving training and work with scientists to conduct visual surveys, acoustic monitoring using specialist equipment, and cetacean identification through dorsal fin photography. They will also help run Silurian - giving them a chance to learn to sail and navigate. Areas covered depend on the weather but will range from Mull of Kintyre in the south, Cape Wrath in the north and St Kilda in the west. These seas are one of Europe\u2019s most important cetacean habitats. Participation costs range from \u00a3683 to \u00a31,500 to cover boat expenses, accommodation, training, food and insurance, and support the trust\u2019s research. More information can be found at HWDT. Colder water species such as the white beaked dolphin could be forced to retreat further north, and while the trust said it had found no evidence of the white beaked dolphin being displaced, continued monitoring of the situation is needed. The charity is calling for volunteers to join its research vessel Silurian to help conduct visual surveys and acoustic monitoring and identification of cetaceans. This includes dolphins, whales and porpoises. Dr Conor Ryan, sightings and strandings officer at Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust said: \u2018An increase in common dolphins means that those wishing to encounter dolphins in the wild are in luck - but further research is needed to explain why this is happening, the extent to which it has been caused by human activity and the implications for other cetacean species.\u2019 Kerry Froud, the trust\u2019s biodiversity officer, added: \u2018Our research expeditions depend on volunteers. \u2018In return they offer the opportunity of a lifetime to contribute to a better understanding of cetaceans and basking sharks, whilst enjoying the beautiful scenery of Scotland\u2019s west coast and experiencing exhilarating sailing. The charity is calling for volunteers to join its research vessel Silurian to help conduct visual surveys, acoustic monitoring and identification of cetaceans - which include dolphins, whales and porpoises - as well as helping to run the yacht. A stock image of the crew of the yacht is shown . Areas that will be covered in the forthcoming survey depend on the weather but will range from Mull of Kintyre in the south, Cape Wrath in the north and St Kilda in the west (all marked on the map)",

'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, 'You know what, I'm not on hard court.' I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not,' said Williams afterwards. 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary.' Meanwhile, the Stuttgart event could decide who is ranked second in the world with Simona Halep close to overtaking Sharapova in the WTA list.

The March 18 video recorded by Faysal Mohamed lasts for 30 seconds and begins with a police officer giving a violent warning while his gun was trained on the teen and his two friends. 'Plain and simple, if you f*** with me I'm going to break your leg before you even get a chance to run. Be honest. I don't screw around,' says the officer. Keeping calm, Mohamed's friend replies to the officer without missing a beat to say, 'Who said I was going to run?' Scroll down for video .

Filmed:\u00a0Faysal Mohamed (picture) was in the car when the officer threatened violence against the three teenagers . Put on the backfoot, the unidentified officer justifies his aggressive tone saying, 'I'm just giving you a heads up. I'm trying to be Officer Friendly right now.' According to Mohamed he and friends had just left the YMCa in south Minneapolis when the police officer pulled over their car. They were told to get out and put into handcuffs and when they asked why, the police officer said, 'Because I feel like arresting you'.

'It's a threat \u2026 it's an illegal, you know, you can't threaten people. And the other thing is you can't break legs. It's not part of the Constitution and it's not part of the laws that we have,' Masson said to CBS News.

With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you\u2019re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don\u2019t do that.'",

So, who are Cape Verde and why has this tiny island off the west coast of Africa suddenly become an international football force? Where are the Cape Verde Islands? Cape Verde is a group of islands 400 miles from Senegal off the west coast of Africa. Its population is around 500,000 and boasts both beautiful beaches and striking volcanic landscapes, making it a haven for tourism . Cape Verde is a picturesque island off the African coast with a population of just 500,000 people . Does it have any footballing tradition? More than you think. Manchester United winger Nani is from Cape Verde and could have played for them instead of Portugal. Celtic and Sweden legend Henrik Larsson's mum is from Cape Verde. Being a former Portuguese colony, most people support the big Lisbon clubs Benfica and Sporting, you see the club's scarves and banners hanging from cafes and bars . Sporting Lisbon ace Nani (centre) is from Cape Verde but decided to represent Portugal at national team level . Former Barcelona star Henrik Larsson could have played for Cape Verde as his mother was born on the island . Why the sudden success? Like a lot of African countries including Algeria and Ghana, Cape Verde decided to start recruiting players who grew up in Europe, mostly Portugal in their case, but were eligible for them through family ties. Around a quarter of the Cape Verde squad are European, although 14 of the 19 players used in Portugal were born on the island. They qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and reached the quarter-finals, and qualified again this year. They are the smallest nation ever to play in the continental finals. Cape Verde were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of their first ever Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 . Who are the star players? Every member of the squad plays club football outside Cape Verde, mostly in Europe and particularly Portugal. Striker Heldon plays for Sporting Lisbon and midfield set-piece specialist Babanco is with Estoril. Odair Fortes, who scored their second goal against the Portuguese, plays in French football for Reims. Other members of the squad ply their trade from Romania, Angola, Cyprus, Hungary, Holland, Bulgaria and Mexico . Sporting Lisbon striker Heldon, currently on loan at\u00a0Cordoba, is one of Cape Verde's key players . What can Cape Verde offer visitors? Firstly, sunshine. The temperatures rarely dip below 21 degrees Celsius (70 F) even in the December and January winger months. The name of the main beach Boa Vista (beautiful view) says it all. It is beginning to become a big tourist destination, just a six-hour flight from the UK. Visitors are encouraged to sample the excellent local fish and admire the spectacular dunes and volcanic mountains. Boa Vista beach, pictured, is one of the main attractions on the small island of Cape Verde . Are they a flash-in-the-pan? The FIFA rankings would suggest not. Cape Verde currently stand 38th in the world, one place ahead of Scotland. Although they failed to make the knockout stages of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, they did return home unbeaten after three draws against Tunisia, Congo and former winners Zambia. Cape Verde celebrate during their 2-0 friendly victory over Portugal on Tuesday evening . What is the special relationship with Portugal? Portuguese explorers discovered the island in 1456 and it stayed a Portuguese colony until independence in 1975. But famine and lack of economic opportunity around the same time meant many young Cape Verde men were forced to go to Portugal to build new lives there. Now the country's football team is helping them re-establish their roots. The reason for Tuesday night's friendly in the first place was to raise money for the victims of a volcanic eruption on the Cape Verdean island of Fogo. And the only saving grace for Portugal... Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't playing. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was rested for Portgual's clash against Cape Verde .",

Federici allowed Alexis Sanchez's driven shot to slip through his body in extra-time as Arsenal ran out 2-1 winners at Wembley to reach their second consecutive final, having beaten Hull to lift the trophy last year. The mistake overshadowed a number of strong saves Federici had made to keep his side in the game and Szczesny had only kind words for his opposite number. Wojciech Szczesny (left) says he feels sorry for Adam Federici after his mistake in the FA Cup semi-final . 'He can be very proud. It only went to extra-time because the goalkeeper was magnificent,' Szczesny told Arsenal's official website. 'We're very happy to go through but personally I do feel for the goalkeeper. 'It's a difficult moment for him. He was the best player on the pitch and in his dreams last night he was probably hoping he would get them through to the final. 'He did everything to do so but got very unlucky in extra-time. The Australian let an Alexis Sanchez effort slip through his hands and sneak over the line in extra-time . 'It was a really good performance from him and he's shown what a good keeper he is.' Arsenal looked like they might enjoy a comfortable afternoon when Sanchez opened the scoring in the first half, but Garath McCleary's equaliser galvanised the Championship outfit. 'You know what to expect when you play Championship sides,' Szczesny said. Federici was inconsolable at the final whistle despite his team-mates and staff trying to help . 'They're very solid defensively, they're not scared to put their foot or head in and they defend very well. 'Today they did that with a great performance by their goalkeeper. It was a difficult game but we just got over the line.' Arsenal are now just one win away from defending the crown they secured last year, with either Liverpool or Aston Villa lying in wait in the final. Szczesny was also at fault for the Reading goal when he let Gareth McCleary's shot find a way into the net . Victory would also see the Gunners become the most successful FA Cup team of all time as they currently sit level on 11 titles with Manchester United. 'We want to win for the fans,' Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla added. 'It's always special to play at Wembley and we have a good opportunity to get the title. 'Now we have to wait for the other team - Liverpool or Aston Villa.'",

'I didn't get down on one knee, because I don't think I would have been able to get back up.' Between them they have had seven children, 15 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. They finally decided to make the union official by giving into pressure from their elderly children. George, currently 102, proposed on Valentine's Day and will marry for the third time on June 13 - getting hitched to Doreen in front of 60 guests. Doreen said: 'I won't be much of a blushing bride, but I'm getting a bit giddy thinking about it.' On their wedding day, the pair will have a combined age of 194 years and 281 days - smashing the previous world record of 188 years set by a couple in 2013.

The pair, started courting in the 1988, when they met through an organisation to find friends for mature people. George, then 76, had just got divorced while Doreen, who lived in Staplehurst, Kent, had sadly become a widow three years earlier following 36 years of marriage. She said: 'He used to come to my house. We got on straight away. He liked the roses in my front garden.'

George said: 'We were having dinner and I asked Doreen if she wanted to be married to me for a short time. I was so happy that she said yes.' The pair will get married at the Langham Hotel, owned by George's son Neil, where they have lived since 2013. Neil, 63, who will be best man, said: 'We've adopted Doreen as our mum and we're delighted that she's going to become a Kirby. 'We're thrilled that they are going to get married in front of all their proud friends and family. 'Also, it's about time my dad has finally made an honest woman out of her.' George was born in London in June 1912 and joined the RAF as a physical education instructor in 1933, where he stayed for 25 years. He was a passionate and talented boxer, winning every single one of the 60 fights he entered during his life. He finally gave up work, and lifting dumbbells, at the age of 94, although continued to tend Doreen's garden in Kent. Doreen was born in Brixton in September 1923 and spent much of her career as a shorthand typist for the Director of Public Prosecutions at Temple, where she worked on transcripts for the cases of the Kray twins and Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. Sprightly Doreen keeps herself in shape by doing yoga classes on the seafront every week. Instead of wedding presents, the pair would like to raise as much money as they can for their chosen charities - the Royal Air Forces Association and the Women's Royal Naval Service .

Lucian Faggiano bought the building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy and had planned to turn it into a trattoria - but renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked. And while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a Messapian tomb built 2,000 years ago, a Roman granary, a Franciscan chapel, and even etchings thought to be made by the Knights Templar. Scroll down for 3D tour . Lucian Faggiano's dream of opening a restaurant was scuppered when a dig to find a blocked sewage point yielded some 2,000 years of hidden history, including vast rooms and pottery (shown in this image that features Mr Faggiano left and his son) In a bid to stop the sewage backing up, Mr Faggiano, 60, and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 Via Ascanio Grandi,The New York Times reported. The search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium. Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and an important trading post for the Romans. But the first layers of the city date to the time of Homer, according to local historian Mario De Marco. Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the building has been turned into Museum Faggiano (pictured) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family . He imagined it would take a week to dig down and fix the plumbing beneath the building, but instead, the DIY mission led to the discovery of a Messapian tomb, a Roman granary (pictured left), a Franciscan chapel - and even etchings from the Knights Templar. An ancient room beneath the modern building is shown right . The search for the pipe (shown in this image of Mr Faggiano and his son) began at the turn of the millennium when no-one could have predicted the treasures hidden beneath the floorboards, which revealed a subterranean world dating back to before the birth of Jesus . It is not unusual for religious relics to turn up in fields or in the middle of the city itself, which has a mixture of old architecture . For example, a century ago, a Roman amphitheatre was recently found beneath a marble column bearing the statue of Lecce\u2019s patron saint, Orontius in the main square and recently a Roman temple was found under a car park. \u2018Whenever you dig a hole, centuries of history come out,\u2019 said Severo Martini, a member of the City Council. Years of excavations have seen the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Here, Mr Faggiano carries a piece of Roman pottery from an underground room . The building yielded plenty of nooks and crannies including mysterious shafts (pictured left and right) which lead to older parts of the building deeper and deeper underground . Lucian Faggiano bought the seemingly standard building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy, (marked on this map) but his dream of turning it into a trattoria was put on hold thanks to a broken toilet.\u00a0Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and a trading post for the Romans . The origins of Lecce in southern Italy are thought to be more than 2,000 years old. It was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, explaining the city's Greek culture. According to legend, a city called Sybar existed at the time of the Trojan War and was founded by the Messapii. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, who gave it the name Lupiae, which later became Lecce. Under the emperor Hadrian, in the second century AD, the city moved two miles (3km) northeast, got a theatre and an amphitheatre and was connected to the Hadrian Port. Oronotius of Lecce, who is known as Sant'Oronzo is thought to have served as the city's first Christian bishop and is now Lecce's patron saint. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was sacked by king Totila in the Gothic Wars. After that it was conquered once again by the Byzantines in 549 and remained part of the Eastern Empire despite some small conquests. After the Normans arrived in the 11th century, Lecce grew in commercial importance again, having been an important trading post in Roman times. It grew rich and became one of the most important cities in southern Italy, evidenced by its many impressive Baroque monuments. Plague broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to Allied fighters fighting the Nazis in the Second World War. Mr Faggiano asked his sons to help fix the problem with the plumbing so he could accelerate the opening of his restaurant, in a building that looked like it was modernised. But when they dug down they hit a floor of medieval stone, beneath which was a Messapian tomb, built by people who lived in the area before the birth of Jesus. Legend has it the city was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, but then the settlement was called Sybar. Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain, and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife, in part perhaps because he was lowering his youngest son, Davide, 12 though small gaps in the floor to aid his work. But his wife, Anna Maria San\u00f2 suspected the work was more complex than it appeared thanks to the amount of dirty clothes she was washing, and because of dirt and debris being taken away. Investigators shut down the site, warning Mr Faggiano he was conducting an unofficial archaeological dig. After a year, work continued but had to be overseen by heritage officials who witnessed the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Retired cultural heritage official, Giovanni Giangreco, who was involved with the excavation, said: \u2018The Faggiano house has layers that are representative of almost all of the city\u2019s history, from the Messapians to the Romans, from the medieval to the Byzantine time.\u2019 Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife. Here, he sorts though pieces of glass and pottery found in one of the rooms. There are even pieces embedded in the wall . Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead.

Despite bearing the financial load of the dig, the family became fascinated about the history beneath their building and made ends meet by renting rooms in it. Mr Faggiano admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant. He said: \u2018At one point, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened.\u2019 Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the incredible building has been turned into Museum Faggiano and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers. However, Mr Faggiano hasn\u2019t given up on his culinary dream and is planning on opening a restaurant at a less complex location \u2013 even though he finally found the troublesome sewage pipe.

James and Hope Ben Canaan last month declared they were living in a 'false system' and left the Gloriavale Christian Community, located at Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's West Coast, with their twelve children and few worldly possessions. Founded by the Australian-born evangelical preacher Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - Gloriavale is home to around 500 residents, sometimes known as Cooperites, who wear a plain, blue uniform and reject birth control. Scroll down for video . Free: The Ben Canaan family (picture supplied) have left behind Gloriavale for the outside world. Many family are pictured here in traditional Gloriavale uniforms, although they are now allowed to wear 'modest' clothing . Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament and reject the outside world . The Ben Canaans fled some 300km south to the town of Timaru, where supporters from the Marchwiel Reformed Baptist Church community have helped them adapt to a world where Christmas and birthdays are celebrated and money is used to purchase goods and services. '(They're doing) really, really good,' said Mr Ben Canaan's aunt, Miracle, who herself fled the picturesque commune with her husband and ten children around six years ago. 'They are adapting very well. They've got a job and everything. They've had a lot of support.' The family left Gloriavale, which is located at Lake Haupiri on the west coast of the South Island, for Timaru, around 320km away . Gloriavale residents do not hold celebrations for birthday parties or Christmas . Miracle, the daughter of Neville Cooper (pictured speaking in a previous interview with New Zealand television) said the Ben Canaan family are adapting very well . The Ben Canaans' close supporters have closed ranks around the family, who last month thanked the community for their support and requested privacy in order to 'settle into our new lives' in Timaru. Sources familiar with Gloriavale, such as Miracle - one of Neville Cooper's ten children - discussed the challenges of adjusting to life outside the commune in general terms to Daily Mail Australia. 'There's just a complete struggle in the outside world,' she said, adding that she had 'nothing' when she left but 'managed to get away' from the community 'without too much drama'. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before. 'You know nothing of just normal, everyday stuff - like renting a home, insurance, any of those types of things. 'Often people don't have their birth certificates or bank accounts. They don't even know how to spend money, how to buy things. 'There's birthday parties, Christmas - none of that was practised in the community... It's huge, adapting (to all of that).' The Ben Canaans will now be able to readily access personal technology, like mobile phones and have a television which they can watch without restrictions. Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - is the Australian evangelist who founded the Gloriavale commune after clashing with church leaders in New Zealand and Australia. In 1995, he spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges . Former Gloriavale residents tend to find it difficult to adapt from the outside world, a former resident told Daily Mail Australia.\u00a0'It's totally different to what you've lived before' The Ben Canaans no longer have to wear their Gloriavale 'uniform'. Instead, Miracle said they will now wear 'modest clothes'. The women in the family will also have to adjust to a world where make-up is worn regularly. Author Fleur Beale, who wrote the book\u00a0Sins of The Father\u00a0about the 1989 escape of Neville Cooper's son, Phil, and his family from the commune, said the biggest challenge the Ben Canaans would have would be financial, particularly given their 12 children. 'You can imagine what it's like trying to find a place to live with a family like that,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Gloriavale residents are often dubbed 'Cooperites'. Pictured is a Gloriavale wedding . The happy couple kiss as they are led from their wedding ceremony . 'You haven't been used to handling money or buying in a shop.\u00a0And what do you wear?' The details of the Ben Canaans' departure from Gloriavale remain unclear.\u00a0Miracle said the community was not surrounded with large walls, but: 'There are different types of walls... 'Psychological walls as well as physical barriers, but no access to telephones and long driveways to be able to leave.' A spokesman for the commune, Fervant Steadfast, told the New Zealand Herald last month the family had been permitted to depart. 'If they want to go and live in Timaru, well, that's their choice and that's what they need to do. 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist.\u00a0Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book\u00a0Sins of the Father,\u00a0said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can.\u00a0That's why they have big families.' Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt.\u00a0And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms. The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels.",

The monarch, who was resplendent in a fuchsia suit and a matching hat, appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers in the Royal Box. Unfortunately for Her Majesty, her horse  was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner. Oh no! The Queen allows herself a look of horror as Ring of Truth is narrowly pipped to the post . One is not amused: The Queen briefly looks glum before smiling at her second place finish . Better than nothing: The Queen's second place appeared to go down well and she got a third place later on . The Queen, who has long been an avid racing fan, had a second runner later in the afternoon but was once again left to rue missed chances after her horse Capel Path came in third. Newbury Racecourse is currently hosting the Dubai Duty Free Spring Trials, one of the most prestigious dates on the flat racing calendar. The event, which coincides with the racecourse's annual real ale festival, also saw runners owned by fellow royal Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai take to the track. Unfortunately for the Emirati, the horses bred by his Godolphin Stud also failed to triumph with one, Strong Chemistry, taking second place in the Dubai Duty Free Full Of Surprises Handicap. Despite failing to register a win, the 88-year-old monarch was on cheerful form and chatted happily to jockey Richard Hughes in the parade ring ahead of the Maiden Stakes. Top tips: The Queen chatted to Ring of Truth's jockey Richard Hughes ahead of the race . Looking around: The Queen, joined by racing manager John Warren (second right), toured the parade ring . Enjoying the day: Afterwards, she made her way back to the Royal Box in the grandstand . The Queen certainly has plenty to smile about, with her fifth great-grandchild due next weekend and sex claims against her son Prince Andrew struck out by a US judge. She has also been  making the most of the recent spell of hot weather and has been pictured twice in the last seven days enjoying a trot around Windsor Great Park. The Queen, who usually rides wearing a silk scarf rather than a riding hat, first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. Lovely: The Queen was resplendent in a cheerful fuchsia coat and a matching hat . Cheerful: The Queen has multiple reasons to be cheerful at the moment, including the impending royal birth . Great-grandchild: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child will be her fifth great-grandchild . Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral. So close: Ring of Truth (left) tries to make up the gap between her and Harvard Man . Pipped: In the event, Harvard Man galloped ahead to win the Maiden Stakes at Newbury .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nFloyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man vs PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history\u00a0will depend upon what happens\u00a0that coming night in the MGM\u00a0Grand Garden Arena. Here are my 12 most significant\u00a0fights in boxing\u2019s history. THE FIGHT FOR RACE . Jack Johnson v James J Jeffries . July 4, 1910 in Reno, Nevada . Jim Jeffries came out of a six-year retirement to take on Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion . Jack Johnson, as the first black world heavyweight champion, was the bane of the white supremacists in America in the early 1900s. They hated it when the Galveston Giant beat Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia, in 1908 to win the title they had brandished as the symbol of their racial superiority. Thus began the quest for The Great White Hope. When Johnson KO\u2019d their best hope of all, Stanley Ketchel, the crusade to bring their old idol Jeffries out of six-year retirement reached a frenzy. Jeffries finally agreed \u2018to respond to that portion of the white race that has been looking for me to defend its athletic superiority\u2019 \u2013 in return for a purse of $120,000 (worth more than three million dollars today). So racist was the press coverage of the build-up to the fight that even The New York Times wrote: \u2018If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbours.' As the racial tensions grew, the sheriff of Reno took the then-unusual step of banning guns and alcohol in the 20,000 capacity arena erected down town. Jeffries, by then a contented farmer, had shed more than 100 lbs to get close to his old fighting weight. White America hated it when 'Galveston Giant' Johnson (left) beat Tommy Burns in Sydney, Australia, in 1908 to win the title and after a frenzied campaign, Jeffries (right) agreed to take the fight for what would equal \u00a33m . The bout was scheduled for 45 rounds but Johnson said he knew it was as good as over in the fourth when he saw the alarmed reaction to his trademark uppercut and \u2018the old ship sinking.\u2019 Jeffries, hitherto undefeated, had never been off his feet but after two knock-downs his corner threw in the towel at the end of the 15th. He dismayed white America by saying: \u2018I could never have whipped Johnson at my best, not in a thousand years.\u2019 Symbolically, the Fourth of July shook the foundations of America\u2019s old white order. Riots broke out that night in 25 cities across the United States and 50 cities including New York and Washington. As police joined enraged white citizens in subduing black American celebrations, 20 people were killed and hundreds injured. Johnson continued to anger the racists on several counts. As heavyweight champion he reigned another five years before surrendering the crown to white challenger Jess Willard, afterwards claiming he had thrown the fight. After beating Jeffries convincingly, Johnson would be world champion for another five years . Johnson then surrendered the crown to white giant Jess Willard, and later claimed to have thrown the fight . Outside the ring he lived the high life of a celebrity and angered the old order again by continuing to marry white wives, three of them in all. The American establishment vented its grudge by accusing him of taking women across state lines for immoral purposes and pursuing him into exile in Europe and Cuba. He finally gave himself up at the Mexican border and served a nominal one-year prison sentence. Before his death, in 1946 at the age of 68, he collaborated on movies about his life and a Broadway play entitled \u2018The Great White Hope\u2019 Jack Johnson is still regarded by many boxing historians as the greatest heavyweight of all time.",

Audrey Nethery, from Kentucky, has Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a life-threatening bone marrow condition that impacts her body's ability to circulate oxygen. Since Audrey is unable to produce enough red blood cells, her parents told the\u00a0Mirror,\u00a0she has faced a host of health issues in her short life. But the condition doesn't stop Audrey from dancing, which she does incredibly well to Bruno Mars\u2019 chart-topping hit Uptown Funk in a widely-watched video that her family posted on her\u00a0Facebook page. Scroll down for video . Girl can groove: Audrey Nethery, six, has a rare illness called Diamond Blackfan Anemia - but her condition doesn't stop her from dancing adorably in videos from her Zumba class . Family affair: Audrey danced while her dad Scott played guitar at a DBA benefit, pictured here . Audrey learned the cute choreographed routine to the Kidz Bop version of the song at her Zumba class in Louisville, Kentucky. Dad Scott Nethery and mom Julie Haise were quick to upload a clip of the six-year-old dancing to Facebook, and the internet was just as quick to watch it. The recording of her complete performance has already reached 2.8 million views since it was posted in March. But Audrey's cute videos don't just bring joy to those who watch them - they also help bring attention to DBA and raise funds for the\u00a0Diamond Blackfan Anemia Foundation. Get your groove on: Audrey's most popular video sees her dancing along to Bruno Mars' hit Uptown Funk (pictured) Shaking her money maker: Audrey's parents are posting videos of Audrey dancing at Zumba class to raise money for the Diamond Blackfan Anemia Foundation; here, Audrey holds a check for $10,000 . Because of her condition, Audrey has already endured 20 blood\u00a0transfusions, and will likely undergo more in the future. Half of people with DBA need a transfusion once every three to five weeks. She was also born with a hole in her heart and a cleft palate, and she isn't growing as fast as her peers, partly because of the steroids she needs to take for her illness. But despite her hurdles, her father Scott told Daily Mail Online, she has plenty of energy and a positive outlook: 'Audrey is a happy, loving, smart, little girl who loves to dance, listen to music, and collect dolls and stuffed animals. She is incredibly strong and leaves an impression on everyone she meets!' Feeling playful: Audrey's dad says she loves to collect dolls like the one she is holding in this picture with her mother Julie . Major music lover: Audrey's dad Scott, pictured here before taking Audrey to a father-daughter dance, says his little internet star is a big fan of Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift . The musically-inclined six-year-old, whose favorite musicians include Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, and the Beatles, has also left an impression on strangers on the internet. Posting cute videos and smiling photos of Audrey have helped the Nethery family to raise thousands of dollars, as well as promote blood drives which they host to give back to the community. 'Once people realize she has a life-threatening illness, it really touches their hearts,' her father told the Mirror.",

Nadal suffered his earliest exit in 12 years at the Barcelona Open last week with a third-round defeat by world No 29 Fabio Fognini and has admitted his confidence is lacking.

Federer said: 'At the French Open, Rafa for me is still the favourite alongside Djokovic who has been playing so well. 'Even though his (Nadal's) form is not as good as in previous years, I still believe when the French Open rolls around he is going to be very difficult to beat.'

Williams head of vehicle performance Rob Smedley claimed earlier this week he was seeing the best of the Brazilian in their nine years working together. After twice being written off in the past, initially following his life-threatening accident in 2009 and again when he left Ferrari at the end of 2013, Massa appears to be a driver at the top of his game. Felipe Massa is preparing for the Bahrain Grand Prix this weekend as he looks ahead to practice .

'The only thing you cannot say (on this occasion) is we are fighting for the championship. 'We had maybe the top car in 2008, and now we are the third team in the championship.

'The team is also working a lot for you, to understand and take in everything you say, to try to develop everything they believe is correct. 'It's fantastic because the driver cannot do anything alone. You need the whole group working for the best of the driver, and that's really counting a lot for me. 'Maybe also, when many of you wrote after my accident that it changed completely my driving, maybe that's not correct.' Suggested to Massa he had been too easily written off, he said: 'It's much easier to write than drive.'

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

The fee-paying school's facilities manager Kevin Bird walked in on the pair while they were engaged in a sex act during an entrance exam day. Colin Turnbull (left), 69, was caught having sex with 'model' Rozina Khanim (pictured left and right) in a classroom at a \u00a313,000-a-year Catholic private school in Birmingham . Caught: Mr Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Ms Khanim by a governor at the school . The school was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and 39-year-old Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on. The teacher has worked at the school for nine years, hiring out a room to offer private tuition to pupils looking to pass the 11+, The Mirror reported. Mr Turnbull has not commented on the tryst, but the school confirmed senior staff had told him to 'never return'. A school spokeswoman said:\u00a0'Once Mr Turnbull's behaviour was discovered by the school's facilities manager, he promptly informed the assistant headteacher. 'Mr Turnbull was challenged; he fully admitted improper behaviour and was then instructed by the assistant headteacher to leave the school site immediately and to not return.' She added that the teacher was not directly employed by the school but he did hire out the classroom for tuition. 'As far as the school is concerned, while behaviour of the sort alleged is wholly unacceptable in any circumstances, we understand from the advice taken from social services that Mr Turnbull had not engaged in any illegal activity.

Elite: The independent Catholic school charges up to \u00a313,000 a year in fees for students to attend . 'There was no pupil involved, the incident was between Mr Turnbull and an adult female,' she added. School regulator Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the Department for Education were all informed of the incident. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Independent schools must adhere to the Independent School Standards. Any suggestion that schools are not doing so will be investigated.' Sources close to the school, however, said Mr Turnbull had been allowed to 'leave by the back door' and were angered that he would be able to continue teaching. Ms Khanim declined to comment but told the Birmingham Mail: 'That's not how it all happened.' The Priory School is attended by around 400 pupils, from 'Nursery and Poppets' classes up until sixth form. It charges fees of up to \u00a312,870 a year for its most senior students. On the school's website, its headmaster Jonathan Cramb says 'knowing what is right and wrong' allows teachers to get on with providing an education for pupils. More than 80 per cent of students got five GCSEs graded A* to C last year, well above the national average.",

The results far surpassed most analysts' expectations for the first three months of the year, when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit - and up 40% from a year ago . Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit. $58 billion in revenue, $13.6 billion in profit . $200 billion in cash, up from around $150 billion a year ago. More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29% to $5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion . 'We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. 'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion \u2014 continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow. Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 14, 2014. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again \u2014 not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to \"rebrand\" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a \"relentlessly, insultingly vapid\" effort of \"demographic box-checking.\" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a \"State Farm commercial gone viral\" and also \"boring as s---.\" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed \"I\" to empathetic \"we.\" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.  In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.  In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a \"T\" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?  Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.  Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming \"Morning in America\"? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.  She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging \"schizophrenia,\" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.",

And now that status update about jetting off on holiday is set to be even easier after Virgin Atlantic announced it would allow each passenger one Facebook login for free so they can post an update from 35,000ft. The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",

Randy Linn, now in a California federal prison where he's two years into his 20-year sentence, said that he can't believe that he tried to destroy a place of worship. Federal prosecutors said Linn drove about two hours from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to suburban Toledo on September 30, 2012, and broke into the mosque where he poured gasoline on a prayer rug and lit it on fire. Randy Linn was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused over $1million in damages to a suburban Toledo, Ohio, mosque . Federal prosecutors said Linn drove from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo (pictured) in September 20112, broke into the mosque, poured gasoline on a prayer rug and set it on fire . 'Well again, I\u2019m very sorry for what I did. Hopefully someday you all can forgive me. And yes I don\u2019t like it here, you can tell everyone, that I\u2019m sure will put a smile on everyone face,' he said in his letter, according to The Blade. Cherrefe Kadri, president of the center, said she thought Linn's letter was sincere . Linn had several firearms in his car and carried a gun into the mosque, which was empty at the time. Linn later said while pleading guilty to hate crime charges that he'd become enraged after seeing images of wounded soldiers in the news and decided to burn the mosque. He also blamed what happened on a day of heavy drinking. Being forgiven, he wrote last December, would 'probably give me a little bit of peace of mind.' Cherrefe Kadri, president of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, told The Blade said she waited nearly six weeks to respond to Linn's letter. Most of the members have moved on, she said. 'I think his letter was truly sincere, and I told him that,' she said. Her response, written on stationery with an image of the mosque at the top, said that she hopes he can make peace with God. 'Neither our community nor I harbor any hatred, ill-will or malice toward you,' she wrote.

It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,\" the military source said Monday. It is customary for Kenyan military sources not to give their names to media. Two of the airstrikes hit Al-Shabaab training camps, according to a resident of the southwest Somalian town of Bardera, almost 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Kenyan border, and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. The Kenyan military began its bombing raids Sunday afternoon, targeting the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Godon Dhawe, Somali resident Ibrahim Mohammed said. Godon Dhawe is between Bardera and the Somalia-Kenya border. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the university attack. Also Monday, a police source said Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre began, arranging for transport. It's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital, roughly 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of the attack, but the police source in Garissa told CNN that Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Journalists on the ground corroborated that report. Once the team entered the university complex, the situation was quickly defused, journalists and the police source said. Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenya's president and deputy president, defended the response time, telling CNN there is always criticism regarding whether \"you reacted as fast as you have or shouldn't have.\" \"With the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better,\" he said, adding that Kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and \"got the job done.\" Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed those remarks in a Monday interview with CNN, saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation. \"We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,\" she said. She repeated Esipisu's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight. \"Obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning, it's always easy to fall back on things like that, but I can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported,\" Mohamed said. \"Obviously hindsight is always 20/20. We did everything that we could do.\" The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud is the mastermind of Thursday's terrorist attack on Garissa University College. The country's Interior Ministry singled out Mohamud, a senior leader of Al-Shabaab, on Twitter. He is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a Kenyan ministry document given to CNN. The ministry posted a \"most wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His position as one of Al-Shabaab's top field commanders in southern Somalia has brought him into direct conflict with Kenyan troops deployed as part of African Union forces in the country. \"This is a man who has a lot of grudges against the Kenyans,\" said Stig Jarle Hansen, an associate professor at Oslo's Norwegian University of Life Sciences and author of \"Al-Shabaab in Somalia: The History and Ideology of a Militant Islamist Group.\" Mohamud's network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's in Kenya's North Eastern Province near Somalia. Garissa, the town where the university attack took place, is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from the Somali border. It's within \"striking distance\" of Mohamud's stronghold in Somalia's Middle Juba province, Hansen told CNN. But he noted that Mohamud is better known \"for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks.\" Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter . Over the weekend, Al-Shabaab promised to bring about \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. Though the terrorist group is based in Somalia, it hasn't confined its violence to the lawless nation. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's attack on a quarry in a Kenyan village near the Somali border, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. He's from a clan, the Ogaden, that has a heavy presence in Kenya and Somalia, Hansen said. \"The borders historically have been meaningless to them,\" he said. CNN exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . On Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\" Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Three days of national mourning for victims of the attack, declared by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, began Sunday. CNN's Christian Purefoy and Lilian Leposo reported from Garissa; Eliott C. McLaughlin and Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta; and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

Inked: Tattoo-loving soldiers in the U.S. Army will soon be able to get inked on their arms and legs thanks to changing rules, officials announced Wednesday . An Army spokeswoman said they will go into effect in the 'very near future.' The changes came as a result of feedback from soldiers. But it wasn't so long ago that the Army made a much different announcement concerning its tattoo policy. Highly unpopular regulations that went into effect in March 2014 banned tattoos below the knee or elbow. Soldiers who already had the ink were grandfathered in. Under those regulations, any soldier with tattoos was barred from seeking a\u00a0promotion to warrant officer or commissioning as an officer. Tattoos have long been a part of military culture, but as they have become more popular, and more prominently displayed on the body, the various branches have been regulating them in to try to maintain a professional look. 'Society is changing its view of tattoos and we have to change along with that,' Odierno said. 'It makes sense. Soldiers have grown up in an era when tattoos are much more acceptable and we have to change along with that.' New rules: Ink may extend all the way to the wrist once the rules go into effect.

That's the mayor's response to an artist's apology and offer to cover the cost of fixing the \"Scary Lucy\" statue that has put the New York town of Celoron in the spotlight this week. The bronze figure of comedian and area native Lucille Ball has elicited comparisons to a \"Walking Dead\" zombie and inspired the Facebook campaign \"We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue.\" The sculpture, a gift to the town from its original owners, has been on display since 2009. Artist Dave Poulin has \"had plenty of opportunity to step forward, and our last conversation he wanted $8,000 to $10,000,\" Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost said. \"And then he stated that if we didn't have the funds and we didn't like the statue, we should take it down and put it in storage.\" After the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend, Poulin publicly apologized Monday for his \"most unsettling sculpture\" in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter. \"I take full responsibility for 'Scary Lucy,' though by no means was that my intent or did I wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic Lucy image,\" Poulin wrote in the letter (PDF). \"From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy's beauty or my ability as a sculptor.\" Poulin said he has been talking to Celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture. It seems that cost has been the chief barrier. \"It puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community, they accept it, and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense.\" Poulin wrote in the letter. But the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind. \"I am willing to put my time and money into redoing the Lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years I can do a much better job,\" Poulin wrote. No thanks, Schrecengost said. He said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue. \"It would be reworked from the shoulders up -- the entire head, neck and shoulders, not just the face,\" Schrecengost said in a news release Tuesday. The town has set up a post office box for donations, which can also be made through Kickstarter. But the controversy may not be over. It seems that nearby Jamestown, New York, also has ties to Lucille Ball's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend. Schrecengost's Tuesday statement referred to an anonymous Facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising Jamestown's Lucille Ball profile at the expense of the Celoron statue. \"The best place for a life size statue of Lucy is right where it is now -- in Lucille Ball Memorial Park in her hometown, in the Village of Celoron, NY,\" he said. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this story.",

The annual Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing. Riot of colour: The Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year . Superstition: People travel from nearby towns to join the Net Boat Fair. Other Water Temple Fairs are held around Chinese New Year. Fishermen from the area take their boats out for show, hoping for good fortune and blessing . Extravagance: An aerial view of the 2015 China Jiangnan Net Boat Fair which commemorates an ancient hero . Starting on different dates in the western calendar, the fair happens annually according to the Chinese Lunar calendar. This year, it began yesterday and the celebrations are expected to last three to seven days, with festivities sometimes being extended to a month long. One of the highlights of the carnival is the Net Boat Fair which showcases the unique culture of Jiangnan water people. One of the most anticipated performances is the 'tie the perfume to your skin' which sees performers attach metal hooks to their forearms. On the other side of the hook hangs a censer containing incense\u00a0or sometimes even heavy anchors with flowers in them to mask the natural smell of the fishing town. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing . The traditional local folklore carnival pays homage to Liu Chengzhong, a figure who led people in annihilating locusts in the Yuan Dynasty . Tradition: Fishermen and their families dress up in traditional clothes. About 50 different folklore groups and nearly two thousand people will be joining the celebrations. It will be the biggest Net Boat Fair in 60 years . The Fair commemorates General Lui Chengzhong, a hero in the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), who successfully eliminated pests during a massive drought. When the Yuan Dynasty came to an end, General Lui killed himself by jumping in the river as an act of loyalty to the Yuan emperor. The locals built the Lui King temple for him and celebrated his heroic acts. Mr Li, one of the participants, told Jia Xing Ping Dao: 'I am the sixth generation to come to this temple fair. 'My great-grandfather once said the celebrations were even more extravagant than what we have now. 'We want to pray for safety and for the Gods to give us proper weather next year.' Music and beats: Little drums are used to scare away angry spirits. This event was listed as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in China in 2011, along with Chinese abacus, an ancient calculator . Cultural heritage: Fishermen prepare shrine offerings, including food, wine, pork, fruit and snacks. An elaborate ritual will be performed on the boats to give thanks to the Gods and the ancestors . The Net Boat Fair has already been included in the list of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage. One of the most important agenda this year is giving out the 'folklore religion activity' certificate to the Liu King temple. Jiangnan Mayor Liang Bokai sauid: 'This marks the first certificate of its kind. It is a massive step for the preservation, promotion and legacy of this folklore religion in the Liu King temple. 'We will further promote our local customs and culture and combine it with tourism in order to put out a new image.' Jiangnan folklore: 'Stepping on whites boats' is a custom for fishermen. Their boats are known to be very unstable because of the exceptionally long frame. Fishermen remodel the boats with a wooden see-saw in the middle. Two people stands on the edge of both sides and jump to make the boat go forward . Tourism: It is a very popular tourist attraction as well. Vendors and shopkeepers appeal their products to passers-by, participants gather for pictures and others pray for blessings .",

A\u00a014-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day . Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday . Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.' Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain  are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead . Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday . London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

The study uncovered a link between belief in God and other societal characteristics, such as a strong social hierarchy. Scientists suggest that religious beliefs help people cope in inhospitable habitats. A study suggests that societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in all-powerful, deities. Here, people carry bags of popcorn through a Christian cemetery, to sell in a shanty town in Lima, Peru . \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland and a founding director of the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences in Jena, Germany. \u2018Prosocial behaviour [actions that help others] maybe helps people do well in harsh or unpredictable environments.\u2019 Together with other experts, he found that communities that believe in a high, controlling God or gods who enforce a moral code, tend to live in politically complex groups with a social hierarchy beyond the local community - and often tend to animals. While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre (Nescent) in Durham, North Carolina, implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland. Here, devotees prepare ritual rice dishes to offer to the Hindu sun god as they attend Pongal celebrations, at a slum in Mumbai . The UK is one of the least religious places in the world, according to a new survey. In a global ranking of 65 countries, the UK came sixth from last, with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious. This compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are \u2018convinced atheists\u2019, with the remaining Britons saying they \u2018did not know\u2019. In contrast, 94 per cent of people in Thailand deem themselves religious, with Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia and Morocco completing the top five, with 93 per cent each. At the bottom of the list was China, where 61 per cent of people are atheists, with only six per cent regarding themselves as religious. It was followed by Japan where just 13 per cent are religious, Sweden with 19 per cent and the Czech Republic on 23 per cent. Globally two-thirds of people consider themselves religious. Those under the age of 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups, the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found. People without a formal education were also more likely to practice a faith. \u2018When researchers discuss the forces that shaped human history, there is considerable disagreement as to whether our behaviour is primarily determined by culture or by the environment,\" said primary author Carlos Botero, of North Carolina State University. \u2018We wanted to throw away all preconceived notions regarding these processes and look at all the potential drivers together to see how different aspects of the human experience may have contributed to the behavioural patterns we see today.\u2019 The study, published in PNAS, took into account variables associated with the environment, history, and culture and involved experts in biology, ecology, linguistics, anthropology, and theology. It began when evolutionary ecologist Dr Botero plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising, high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds. He took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion, and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation. Professor Gray said: \u2018Although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive, the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically, we get some insight.\u2019 While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study  implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. Here, Muslims on the outskirts of New Delhi participate in Friday prayers at a slum area during the holy month of Ramadan . The team used historical, social, and ecological data, such as plant growth, rain and temperature, for 583 societies to illustrate the multifaceted relationship between belief in moralising, high gods and external variables. They used the Ethograhic Atlas, which was collated during the last century, to pinpoint communities around the world and access data about religious beliefs, agriculture, and animal husbandry. \u2018The goal became not just to look at the ecological variables, but to look at the whole thing. 'Once we accounted for as many other factors as we could, we wanted to see if we could still detect an environmental effect,\u2019 Dr Botero said. \u2018The overall picture is that these beliefs are ultimately shaped by a combination of historical, ecological, and social factors.\u2019 Dr Botero believes that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in examining human behaviour from a cross-disciplinary standpoint. The team plans to further their study by exploring the processes that have influenced the evolution of other human behaviours including taboos, circumcision, and the modification of natural habitats. Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous - a phenomenon known as The Scrooge Effect, after the Dickens character (shown) Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous, according to a new study. It also boosts the feeling of pleasure we get from doing a good deed. \u2018Acting pro-socially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety, and in turn produces psychological satisfaction,\u2019 researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. The study builds on the terror management theory, which says that humans deal with our fear of death by believing in an afterlife or devoting our lives to a cause that will live on, Pacific Standard reported. Previous work found that Americans reminded of their own mortaility gave more money to a charity that said it would help people in the country, than one that had an international focus. It suggested that thoughts of death made people strengthen their beliefs - such as allegiance to a religion or country \u2013 and is known as The Scrooge Effect. The new study included an experiment, where people were asked to split $8 between themselves and a stranger, while reporting their own satisfaction. Before this, Polish student participants were asked to fill out a survey about death, or dealing with a trip to the dentists, then complete a crossword. The researchers found that volunteers who had previously thought about death gave more money to the stranger and said they felt happier doing it. The experiment seems to bolster The Scrooge Effect and suggests that reinforcing a person\u2019s self-image of being generous, or supporting a cause, are effective ways of managing fear of dying.",

Nobody else would get close. This has been his best season in a Chelsea shirt. Two seasons ago Rafa Benitez said he couldn\u2019t cope with two games a week. That will have frightened the life out of John. So credit Jose Mourinho for trusting him and building that defence around him. Terry has never had pace but that is not a problem as he reads the game so well. He didn\u2019t break sweat against Arsenal and Chelsea were too streetwise for Arsene Wenger\u2019s team. John Terry celebrates after the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium . Chelsea are undefeated against the top four this season where Arsenal have lost twice \u2014 that is the gap Wenger\u2019s side need to bridge and Terry has been a huge part of that. I remember playing against him early in his career and after I tackled Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, he clattered right into me \u2014 he wasn\u2019t going to let me put one on his team-mate. That\u2019s when I knew he could grow up to be a special player. Terry  celebrates with his team-mates after the Premier League draw against Arsenal in north London . One Hull of a result . Beating Crystal Palace was a massive result for Steve Bruce. Their run-in is horrendous and had they lost at Selhurst Park, surely it was all over. It shows how football fortunes can change in an instant. Hull are not the best away from home but as the stats below show, they thoroughly deserved their win. Dame N\u2019Doye was the star and could have had a hatful but I love the way he took his second. That little delay of his foot was just enough to put the defender off balance and give him a sight of goal before firing it in. Bruce had to move quickly to sign him on deadline day in February but N\u2019Doye has done well since joining from Lokomotiv Moscow. If he carries on like this and Hull stay up they might have to build a statue outside the ground! Dame N'Doye  celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Premier League win against Crystal Palace . Can Manuel still be the man? After recent results, people say Manuel Pellegrini is a dead man walking. Beating Aston Villa was important but can he keep his job under so much pressure? Deciding Pellegrini\u2019s fate will be one of the toughest choices Man City\u2019s owners have faced. I spoke to Frank Lampard and he says they are fantastic people \u2014 there is no desire to chop and change. City are so close. They have world class training facilities, an expanding stadium and absolute fortunes to spend. But this season has been a blip. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during the Premier League match against Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium . Pellegrini won two trophies last year, so they could keep him and let him rebuild. Recruitment has been poor and they need to get it right in the summer. But it\u2019s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year. If he is sacked, who gets the job? Pep Guardiola is the dream but it would take a major fallout for him to leave Bayern. Patrick Vieira has the tools but no experience, Jurgen Klopp would be appointed on past success and Diego Simeone is an underdog manager. City want style. There is no shame losing to Barcelona, it\u2019s the defeats to the likes of Burnley and Stoke that have hurt Pellegrini. City could still get rid of him, but I\u2019m sure it would be with a heavy heart. Manchester City are dreaming of Pep Guardiola but it's unlikely the Bayern boss will make the move to City . Flying Foxes . Talk about timing your run. Leicester are in amazing form. Four straight wins is good for any side, let alone one facing a relegation battle. It\u2019s been a tough season for Nigel Pearson with all the drama of him being \u2018sacked\u2019 and reinstated, but he has got his team flying at exactly the right time. Home disadvantage? There were only two home wins this weekend with three away and five draws. At this stage in the season sometimes it\u2019s far easier to play with freedom on the road than under huge pressure at home. Toon's poor show . The way Newcastle are going I would not be surprised if they don\u2019t get a single point between now and the end of the season. They have been an embarrassment. It\u2019s as if they are in the clubhouse with 35 points. They don\u2019t look like adding to that any time soon and anybody with Newcastle in their run-in has got a chance of a result. A deflated Jack Colback and Siem de Jong trudge off the pitch following yet another Newcastle defeat . The Newcastle players react as they suffer yet another defeat, this time to Premier League rivals Swansea . Chaos at Watford, but it works . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates scoring for Watford against Brighton at the Amex Stadium . Watford have spent 20 days at the top of the Championship table. Bournemouth, who are on the verge of promotion, have led for 111 days. Congratulations to Watford after their promotion, but if ever you want an example of how not to run a club, they have been it this season! With unpredictable owners, four different managers and a host of key players on loan, it has been chaos. They have been outsiders throughout but have come through when it counts. I\u2019ve loved watching Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo bang in the goals and you can\u2019t argue with the results. It just shows you there\u2019s no right or wrong in football. The Watford players celebrate victory against Brighton as they all but secure their promotion to the big time . United slip up . Two weeks ago Man United had all the answers but two defeats later it\u2019s back to the drawing board. It\u2019s not that they have been found out, but maybe they are not as good as people thought. They were just in good form. They have had the luxury of playing with no European football this season so still have work to do in the summer. It\u2019s the same feeling with Everton. They started the season dreadfully but have won five out of six. I\u2019m a Roberto Martinez fan and they have good players so we should not be surprised that things have changed. Louis van Gaal watches on as his Manchester United side are comprehensively beaten by Everton . Paying the penalty . Why oh why did Danny Ings not take that penalty for Burnley? Yes, he is out of form and without a goal since February but what better way to get back on the scoresheet? He took one against Aston Villa in November and scored and he and Burnley needed that goal. Then to make things worse Leicester go up the other end and score 27 seconds later. Burnley midfielder Matthew Taylor holds his head after missing the chance to score from the spot . It was a similar story at QPR. Charlie Austin\u2019s goals have kept his side going this season but he has missed two big penalties now \u2014 against Hull and West Ham. When every goal is so vital you can\u2019t afford to pass up these chances. PS If QPR go down, Austin won\u2019t be the only player with plenty of suitors. Matt Phillips has been scoring and setting up good goals in the run-in. He is a useful Premier League player. Charlie Austin looks on angrily following his penalty miss against West Ham United at Loftus Road .",

This aerial photo shows a path of destruction, after a tornado swept through the small town of Fairdale, Illinois . Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could . The DeKalb County Sheriff's Office bused residents back to the scene of the devastation so they could begin to take stock of what was left of their property. Seeing the wreckage up close for the first time since Thursday's storms left some amazed that they survived. 'I thought my parents were dead,' said 32-year-old Adam Davis, who hopped into his truck Thursday and raced along with the tornado in the hopes of getting to his parents' house and rescuing them before the twister struck. He found them standing in their doorway frozen in disbelief and grabbed them just in time. On Saturday, he was helping collect what could be salvaged from his childhood home, now full of debris, its roof ripped off and its windows broken. 'It's not necessarily the mementos yet; it's the essentials for now. One step at a time,' he said. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms, the National Weather Service confirmed Saturday. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people. Debris surrounds a plot where a house once stood in the farming community. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way . The weather service gave it a preliminary EF4 rating \u2014 its second strongest \u2014 with winds of between 180 and 200 mph. It was a half-mile wide and remained on the ground for at least 28.7 miles, a record long path for that part of Illinois. Al Zammuto, a 60-year-old machinist, was preparing to inspect what was left of the roof on a former schoolhouse that he had been transforming into his home over the past year. He will have to start over. 'I don't know how much of the roof came off,' he said. 'I'm going to climb a ladder later today and see.' In all, some 70 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Fairdale, authorities said. Another 50 buildings were hit in nearby Rochelle. All buildings have been searched, but not all residents have been accounted for, so cadaver dogs are being used in parts of DeKalb County, the Illinois State Police said late Friday. The tornado blew numerous vehicles from nearby interstates, and troopers helped rescue a trapped driver in an overturned semi-trailer. As the cleanup began, tales of survival continued to emerge. The vortex created a path through the fields and wiped out a house as it made its way to the town. A building is left standing in a property above . Kelly Newman, 46, lost her Rochelle home. For her, the storm began with a moment of playful wonder at the size of the hail. She ran outside to collect some of the pieces to put it in the freezer to show her children. 'Then I noticed to the southwest there was a huge black funnel thing, but it didn't look like a tornado because it was just way too wide,' she said. But the telltale train-like roar sent them and their 19-year-old daughter running for the basement. The house cracked and collapsed around them, raining down debris and a dusting of what she described as 'muddy soot.' The family survived, and several police officers helped free her husband, who had been trapped nearly upside down between two collapsed walls. 'We're alive, we were spared. Our lives were saved,' she said. A destroyed house is seen in Fairdale is pictured on Friday, hours after a tornado ripped through the community .

Lyvette Crespo, 43, entered the plea to a grand jury indictment. She was ordered held on $150,000 bail and could face up to 21 years in state prison if convicted. Crespo shot Bell Gardens Mayor Daniel Crespo three times in the chest on September 30. The killing came after the late mayor's years of domestic abuse, the widow claims. However, the late Crespo's brother says those claims are all a lie and that he has evidence proving Mrs. Crespo is a cold-blooded killer. Indicted: Lyvette Crespo (right) allegedly shot her husband,\u00a0Bell Gardens, California Mayor Daniel Crespo (left), in September during a heated argument about his infidelity. She's now been indicted on charges of voluntary manslaughter . History of abuse? The Crespos were high school sweethearts. Mrs. Crespo claims her husband had become increasingly abusive in the months leading to his death. She says she shot him after he punched their son, who'd tried intervening during an argument . In text messages that brother, William Crespo, provided to the LA Times, Mrs. Crespo appears to have threatened to shoot her husband at least once before doing the deed. 'I'll find out who ... u got flowers for. Has to be a bell gardens wh***,' reads a message from Lyvette to her husband. Mr. Crespo replied: 'It better last time U threaten to shoot me in head!!!' In a civil suit filed against Lyvette on behalf of his mother, William Crespo has asked for more than $53 million in damages for the death of his brother, who he says was killed 'with malice and in cold blood,' by Mrs. Crespo. Crespo has told authorities it was self-defense after he punched their 19-year-old son in the face after he intervened in the couple's argument. Counter claim:\u00a0Daniel Crespo's brother William (pictured) says his ex sister-in-law's claims are all lies and that she killed her husband in cold blood . Broken family: In this file photo, attorney Claudia Osuna holds a photo of the Crespo family - from top left to bottom right, Bell Gardens, Calif., Mayor Daniel Crespo, his daughter Crystal, his wife Lyvette and son Daniel Crespo Jr. Daniel Crespo Jr. called 911 to report the shooting, telling a dispatcher: 'He's on the floor dying. He hurt me.' Daniel Crespo, a Los Angeles County deputy probation officer, was elected in 2001 to the City Council of Bellflower, a city of about 42,000 residents. The mayor's position rotated among council members. He and his wife were high school sweethearts and married as teenagers in 1986. However, the autopsy report contained allegations by a daughter, Crystal Crespo, that her father had been verbally and physically abusive toward her mother over two decades. She said the abuse had become more physical in recent years because of arguments over Daniel Crespo's infidelity, but it was never reported and never left serious injuries. Daniel Crespo's brother, William Crespo, has denied the abuse allegations. The mayor's mother filed a $53 million lawsuit last fall in which she calls Crespo a 'cold-blooded killer' who picked a fight with her husband knowing their son would intervene. What happened?

Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment: \u00a0This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady\u2019s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead\u2019s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration:\u00a0Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .",

After a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between Iran and world powers, many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon. Businesses are already gearing up for a time after the restrictions are lifted, and many people anticipate a huge boost to the economy. \"Naturally we are all very happy,\" one woman in central Tehran told us. \"We expect better days economically and culturally. We want better relations with the rest of the world.\" Another man added, \"I have a good feeling about it, because my country will be free of the fear of war.\" But this weekend, just a few miles down the road, Iran's leaders were celebrating their war machine as the military held its annual National Army Day parade. As the U.S., Saudi Arabia and other countries criticize Iran for its alleged involvement in funding and supplying the Houthi rebels who have seized power in much of Yemen, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has praised the military as peacemakers for the Middle East. \"Today, our army is the source of our national stability,\" Rouhani said in his speech at the parade. \"And even more than that -- it is also a source of security and stability in the entire region.\" The country's top military brass seemed surprisingly relaxed and unusually willing to speak with Western media outlets. Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, the Chief of Staff of Iran's armed forces and a man who is close to Rouhani, told CNN he hopes the U.S. and Iran can work closer together to fight ISIS in Iraq. \"The unity of humanity based on the right of all human beings to live, and their right to freedom, dictates that all human society is threatened by ISIS, and all humans should unite against ISIS and work against them,\" Firouzabadi said. Firouzabadi also repeated Iran's longstanding claim that the U.S. is partly responsible for creating ISIS, which now controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. \"If the Americans really didn't create ISIS, and if they want to destroy ISIS, it is possible for them to achieve that,\" he said. \"But we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the U.S. and Britain. We hope that one day, because of their national interests and the will of their nations, the U.S. and the UK will decide to really fight ISIS.\" Iran has often dismissed the coalition air campaign as ineffective, while praising its own strategy of training, advising, outfitting and directing Iraqi Shia militias, Kurdish forces and the Iraqi military. But in another apparent softening of rhetoric, a top military official said he hopes that the animosity between Iran and America will fade. \"At the moment, we consider the United States to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us,\" General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, the commander of Iran's ground forces, told CNN. \"We would like the U.S. to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in the U.S. military leadership,\" Pourdastan continued. \"We trust the American people, but the tone of U.S. government and military officials is such that we still consider the U.S. a threat.\" At the same time, Iran's leadership is showing no sign of toning down its own fiery rhetoric -- and the usual \"Death to Israel, death to the U.S.A.\" chants echoed around the crowds at the military parade. The U.S. welcomes some of Iran's support for Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS, but says at this point that there simply is no basis for deeper cooperation on the battlefield. And for Iran's part, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also rejected direct coordination between the two long-time adversaries. And even though many Iranians have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal, the leadership in Washington and Tehran is far more skeptical. In a recent televised speech, Khamenei said it was possible that there would be no deal by the June 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all. And Iran's army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites. Meanwhile, the White House has been confronted by a Congress that is largely hostile to the negotiations, and has been making the case that a deal cannot be about trust, but about monitoring and verification. \"Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't abide by its agreement, that we don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said last Friday. \"That's our main concern. And I think that goal, of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation, that goal can be met.\" So far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week. But despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air, there is also fear that things could fall apart if Tehran and Washington aren't willing to make tough concessions.",

Patients at Wolfson Children's Hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them. Scroll down for video . The toys include a long 'tail' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. The Idaho firm behind the system\u00a0has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the US, letting anyone play with cats via the system - and plans to sell a version for pet owners via Kickstarter next month. 'Play through programs like the Play with Cats project has a powerful normalizing effect on a child's hospital stay,' said Wolfson Children's Hospital President Michael Aubin. Patients who are in isolation with a specific treatment or a chronic medical condition like cystic fibrosis or bone marrow transplant will be among the first to benefit. Made possible with a $15,000 grant from the Mattel Children's Foundation, the Play with Cats program connects to 151 hospital rooms throughout Wolfson Children's Hospital via GetWellNetwork. The Wolfson Children's Hospital Auxiliary first started a Pet Therapy Program in 1995. Two years ago, the hospital opened a pet visitation program, allowing children with long-term stays or in end-of-life situations to receive a visit from their own dog. 'This is the latest program to be implemented at Wolfson Children's Hospital to give more of our patients a chance to interact with a kitten or cat, which provides a welcome distraction.' said Pat Kirkland, Family Support Services Manager at Wolfson Children's Hospital. 'About 20 percent of our patients are on isolation at some time during their stay, so we are excited to bring the healing power of an animal friend to the bedside.' 'Our partnership with Wolfson Children's Hospital began with JHS veterinarians providing required vet checks and vaccines that allow patients in the hospital to visit with their own dogs. 'We are proud to expand the partnership using iPet so that all patients may benefit from the healing power of animals,' said Denise Deisler, executive director of the Jacksonville Humane Society. The system was developed by Idaho firm ReachIn. 'The idea came from the ability to move anything over the web,' Scott Harris of the firm told MailOnline. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. 'We started working on the technical side of remote control, and then an engineer went home to work on arm overnight. The next day he came in, took me to one side and said he'd been moving the arm, and his cat had started playing with it. He admitted he then hadn't got any work done and spent the evening watching the cat play - so I thought we might be on to something.' The firm contacted a local animals shelter and worked with them to build three toys. In May 2012, the first catcam went online, and was a huge success. Users join a virtual queue, and can then control three toys and a webcam in the enclosure. The iCompanion site that visitors play with cats in rescue homes around the US virtually . Now the firm plans to expand the idea after huge interest from shelters. Users from 90 countries played within 2 weeks playing, and adoption rates went up 57% at shelters, said Harris. The firm is now trying to work out how to fund the systems after over 300 charities got in touch wanting it. The firm is launching a kickstarter campaign to allow people to buy their own version of the system on May 1st. Users can control a variety of toys in the enclosures . 'it costs us to build these things and maintain them, and 317 shelters have requested it, so we are working with as many as we can.' The firm hopes to develop a low cost version costing around $200 for shelters, but admits the R&D costs are currently too high. The user is shown a live video feed to they can see their cat reacting to the toys . Kitten cam! Cats at a shelter in the Us play wiht the internet controlled toys .",

Marcelo and Mario Suarez were both booked during the 0-0 draw at the Vicente Calderon and due to accumulation of yellow cards will not be present during the return at the Santiago Bernabeu. Neither player were happy with referee Milorad Mazic, both feeling that their challenges weren't strong enough to be punished with a card.

The midfielder published a statement on Twitter after the game, reading: 'I'd like to apologise if anyone has been offended by my words after the game, it was not my intention. 'I meant to say that games of this magnitude should be given to a referee from one of the big leagues. Nothing more, we all make mistakes. Lets keep working. #AupaAtleti.'

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)In 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called \"comfort women\" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the \"comfort women\" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the \"comfort women\" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the \"comfort women.\" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national \"coming to terms with the past\" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving \"comfort women\" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.",

It is a campaign which has exceeded so many expectations but Swansea have yet to pick up a point after an international break this term, although in mitigation those have been away games at Chelsea, Stoke and Manchester City.

'I watched their last game against Chelsea and thought they performed extremely well and were unlucky to lose,' Monk said. 'We've always had close games with Hull. It's a tough physical game with them but they have got quality to hurt us if we're not on our game. 'This is it, the business end of the season and everyone's fighting for their own reasons.

Diwalinen Vankar, 58, had gone with her 19-year-old daughter Kanta, to the bank of the Vishwamitri River, 40 kilometres from Vadodara, in west India, to wash their clothes. As they were wringing out their laundry, a mugger crocodile grabbed Kanta's right leg and dragged her into the murky river. Diwalinen Vankar, 58, (pictured left) fought off a 13ft crocodile with a washing paddle after it attacked her 19-year-old daughter Kanta (right) A crocodile grabbed\u00a0Diwalinen Vankar's daughter's legs on the banks of the\u00a0Vishwamitri River in west India and dragged her into the river - her mother rescued her by hitting it with a washing paddle (stock image) The sudden attack rattled Vankar, who hastily grabbed her daughter's hand to try and pull her free from the clutches of the crocodile. But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch. 'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said. 'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go. 'It took me 10 minutes to finally free her from its jaws.' Kanta suffered a leg injury after the crocodile grabbed her right leg and dragged her into the murky river . This map shows the Vishwamitri River, near Vadodara, where the attack by the crocodile took place . Vankar said she went to wash her clothes in the river as there was a lack of water and electricity in the village . After hearing the commotion, villagers rushed to help and drove Kanta to hospital, where doctors were treated her for a leg injury. She has since been discharged. Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.' She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return. A wildlife officer said the river is home to ferocious crocodiles and villagers have been warned to steer clear of the river. 'She has miraculously survived. These crocodiles are huge and ferocious,' Ashok Pandya, Vadodara wildlife officer told the Times of India. 'We have been warning them not to go near the river.' Last year, six people were killed in crocodile attacks across Vadodara. There are more than 200 crocodiles in the\u00a0Vishwamitri River.

'It was only a short time ago that Wayne could have easily left United. But I always felt he was as good as any British player out there; wherever he plays, he's a great footballer and, most importantly, he'll always score goals.

When the reality TV star once shared a snap mid-way through her makeover revealing her contouring tricks, a new beauty craze was born. And now, the secret behind the 34-year-old reality TV star's glowing skin has been revealed. Scroll down for video . Want to look like Kim Kardashian? Now you can, because the flawless star has revealed the products that give her that envy-inducing glow . The mother-of-one, who shared her beauty essentials on Instagram, protects her skin with a \u00a365 ($96) Creme de la Mer\u00a0SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, which claims to prevent the appearance of discolorations while providing protection from the sun. The cream, which is packed with gemstones, peculiar sounding 'photonic spheres' and smart seaweeds, can also be used as a make-up primer. Kim shared her beauty essentials on her Instagram page and, of course, a hairbrush from her own brand featured . Kim then loves to spritz her face with a \u00a312 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier. The little-known product is made with roses and aloe and aims to to hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake. The brand say the product is also 'excellent as a make-up refresher and midday pick-me-up'. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a NARS face wash and Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System. The NARS Gentle Cream Cleanser apparently helps to maintain skin's moisture balance while removing makeup and impurities. Meanwhile, the vibrating brush uses a micro-massage motion, which is said to work within skin's natural elasticity to gently remove the impurities traditional methods leave behind-leaving skin softer, smoother and more beautiful. Clearly it's working for Kim. Other beauty essentials in her cosmetics bag include a hairbrush from her own range, Kardashian Beauty, which she established with her sisters, as well as an Essie nail polish. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Kim said: 'As far as products, I love the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.' Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'. 'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping'. The brow groomer uses the Dipbrow Pomade, which she applies with her \u00a315.50 Brow Wiz, an ultra-fine brow pencil, which claims to fill in sparse brows for a naturally fuller appearance. She then defines and enhances the brows with her \u00a317 Brow Powder Duo, which is enriched with Vitamins C and E to nourish and protect, before sealing the powder make-up into place with her \u00a315 Beauty Genius Clear Waterproof Gel, which she says seals and waterproofs any loose powder. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, left,\u00a0loves to spritz her face with a \u00a312 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier, centre, and protect her skin from the sun with\u00a0a \u00a365 ($96) Creme de la Mer SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, right . As well as running a successful beauty empire with her sisters, Kim has revealed that she wants to design a range of handbags for toddlers. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star - who has 22-month-old daughter North with husband Kanye West - is set to launch her Kardashian Kids collection next week and has revealed she's already thinking about adding more accessories to the range. Asked about designing shoes or handbags, she told Vogue.com: 'Well, North does love handbags. And anything where there's a little bit of glitz.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping' The 34-year-old beauty admits that while her daughter is a big fan of fancy shoes, she's not so keen on the range of headbands included in her mother's new collection. Kim explained: 'Every day she wakes up and says, \"shoes\". You have to bargain with her - before you change her diaper she needs a pair of shoes on ... She hasn't been the biggest fan of keeping something on her head.' Kardashian Kids launches on Nordstrom.com on April 13 with prices ranging between $25 (\u00a316.80) and $35 (\u00a323.60) and Kim admits that while she did a lot of research online, she also drew inspiration from her own wardrobe which is why the collection features pieces such as peplum tops and faux leather leggings.

Jenny-Lee, 28, was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy, and although doctors at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy, she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion. However her mother Heather has told The Daily Telegraph that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child, named Aroura. 'She knew chemo would kill Aroura \u2014 she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened, she wanted that baby alive,' Heather said. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . 'We were told she would have six weeks to live \u2014 she fought to have the baby. That's the decision she made \u2014 she gave up her life.' Instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter's unnecessary death, claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner, but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy. The Sydney mother's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. Jenny-Lee's elder daughter Chelsie, who was only 10 when her mother died in August 2009, also defended her mother. However the 28-year-old's brother David blamed the religion for how his sister died, calling her a 'fool'. 'It was not my sister who was sad and selfish, it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense,' he said. Jenny-Lee, 28, had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' She was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a\u00a0challenge\u00a0to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. In a recent article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber\u00a0Biscoe wrote:\u00a0'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.

The scathing critics told the six-months pregnant meteorologist Kristi Gordon that her 'front end looks like the Hindenburg\u00a0and your rear end looks like a brick s***house.' Fans jumped to support her when Gordon read out excerpts from the letters and emails on TV, but it seems that abuse of pregnant TV presenters daring to get on with their jobs during their pregnancy is nothing new. Australian presenter and model Nicky Buckley famously soldiered on with her presenting job on The Sale of the Century after falling pregnant in 1997, continuing to wear the glamorous, figure-hugging gowns her job required of her. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the barrage of abuse that was bestowed upon my unborn baby and me by a multitude of critics who were determined to dampen the joyous marvel of pregnancy,' Buckley, now 49, writes in her newly-released memoir. Scroll down for video . Pregnant and proud: Buckley copped heavy criticism for showing bump on TV but stood her ground . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about the book, 'Nicky Buckley: A Memoir', she shared just how bad the criticism became. 'I was told I jammed fax machines at Channel 9 and newspapers - with faxes coming in from people commenting negatively.' 'At the time there wasn't any maternity wear except kaftans which covered you from head to toe, hiding your boobs and bump,' she said. Bitterness over bump: Buckley wore sexy dresses that revealed her bump, \u00a0shocking TV audiences, and hit back in magazine interviews saying she refused to bend to critics . TV Scandal: Nicky Buckley enraged public by staying on air throughout her nine month pregnancy . Family first: Buckley bucked preconceived notions of women in TV and continued to work to support family . As her role was to wear glamorous evening dresses and there wasn't adequate maternity wear available, she  just went up a size from her usual attire and got on with things. 'I wasn't out to raise the flag or cause a stir, I simply wanted to work \u2013 as was my right. Yet in doing so people had other opinions and thought I shouldn't be seen publicly with a bump.' 'I had a mortgage, people tend to forget  and put you in a bubble. But I still had a mortgage and do you think I should just stop and be taken off the air?' Game model: Game show host and model copped flack for her bump and continued to work to pay the bills . Glamorous to gritty: Despite her glamour role, Buckley says the pregnancy showed the ugly side to TV . 'I needed to pay the bills and I was happy with what's going on,' she said. 'Looking back I'm proud of how strong I was. I can't push the point hard enough, I was steadfast and strong, I was going to work and do my job.' 'I couldn't wait to share the news with my girlfriends but after the usual squeals of congratulations  they said \"what are you going to do about work?' she reflects in the book. A friend even made the shocking suggestion to Buckley that they could build her a podium to stand behind once she started to show. Host to husband: Buckley married her co-host Murray Bingham and subsequently had three children with him . While taken aback, she said she believes people saw her role as glamorous one and being pregnant clearly didn't fit with that image. 'Despite my blossoming belly and impending birth, unintentionally I had sparked a very public debate that divided a nation - was pregnancy  something to be ashamed of? Were pregnant women even attractive?  said Buckley. Not to mention the dress she wore on the runway at a Myer Fashion Festival that saw eyebrows raised. 'That caused a real stir. It was a dress with a cut out heart over the belly, people saw it outrageous but the designer and I thought it was beautiful and embraced the bump and fashion all at the same time.' Nearly 50 and fabulous: Buckley now at nearly 50 is celebrating her age with release of her memoir . The book: Buckley's memoir on sale now for $29.99 .",

The woman, named only as Ms Zhao, lives in a house bursting with frozen dishes and snacks. Husband Yin Yunfeng spent the last week of his annual holiday making all sorts of stir-fried dishes as well as about 1,000 dumplings as a way to show his love to his wife, according to thePeople's Daily Online. Treasure chest: Ms Zhao has enough food to last for a year prepared by her husband . Feast: The husband, Yin Yunfeng, spent a week cooking all sorts of stir-fried dishes . All-you-can-eat: He also made about 1,000 dumplings before returning to his regiment in Tibet . The devoted husband is worried that his wife would be eating instant noodles all the time so he cooked different types of dishes and put them into small foam containers to be frozen. Ms Shao said she is extremely busy with work and only has fresh meals when her husband is home. But now all she needs to do is to reheat the food in the microwave. Mr Yin is stationed in a regiment in Tibet and only gets to go home - which is some 2,700 kilometres away in southern China - once a year. 'Although I mentally prepared myself for this life when I married him, I had no idea it would be so tough,' sais Ms Zhao. 'At the end of every holiday I would be devastated and would cry all day but I will continue to support him in his career and look after this family.' She added: 'The food he prepared is enough for me for one year and every time I think of this my heart is warm.' In addition to meals, Mr Yin has also bought a large amount of snacks and hid them in different corners of the house as daily surprises to his wife. Well-arranged: The husband also separated all dishes into small foam containers to be frozen . Secret:\u00a0Mr Yin has also bought a large amount of snacks and hid them in different corners of the house . Note of love:\u00a0Yin left his wife a note saying he hoped he would be home when she finishes the food and snacks . Every day, he texts her the clues to find these snacks. 'Today you have been studying very hard and I have a reward for you. Behind the sofa on the right there is a gap and I have left you a packet of raisins,' reads one of the messages. The snacks include chips, pumpkin seeds, chewing gum, biscuits, beef jerky and instant noodles. Yin said he hoped he would be home by the time his wife finishes the food and snacks.",

Competitive eater Mary Schuyler accomplished the stunning feat in front of hundreds at the Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday. Schuyler is such a champ that the four teams of two that competed against her didn't even come close to winning - even though they were allowed to split their dinners. Scroll down for video . Winner, winner, steak dinner: Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at the Big Texan Steack Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday . Fast eater: The 120-pound mother-of-four ate three steak dinners - complete with sides - in just 20 minutes . Worth it: For breaking the record for quickest steak dinner eaten and for finishing her three meals in under an hour, Schuyler took home a grand total of $6,000 . In addition to the three massive 72-ounce steaks, competitors also had to eat three baked potatoes, three shrimp cocktails, three salads and three rolls for a whopping 15 pounds of food. While that might sound daunting to most, Schuyler was confident that she would beat out the other competitors with her experience. 'They would have had to eat their half in like four minutes,' Schuyler told the Amarillo Globe-News. 'If you\u2019re not used to doing this, four minutes is hard.' Filling: The dinner included three 72-ounce steaks, three shrimp cocktails, three baked potatoes, three salads and three rolls . Champion: Though her competitors were allowed to tackle the challenge in teams of two, none came close to winning the competition . She cleaned her plate: Schuyler poses with a fan after the feat, showing off her belly bloated from the competition . However, she was a bit nervous about tackling a three steak dinners since she ate just two when she competed at the restaurant last year. 'I come in thinking I'm going to fail, but you know if I win it's a lovely parting gift and that's cool,' she told KFDA-TV. 'I also get free steak so I don't really lose.' As the competition began, Schuyler covered up with a pair of sunglasses and put up her sweatshirt hood to focus on the task at hand and finished her first steak in just four minutes and 18 seconds - beating the previous record she set last year of four minutes and 48 seconds. Hundreds cheered her on below the competition table set up side the restaurant on a sunny day, as Schuyler ripped her way through the steaks. Competitors had an hour to finish their $72 dinners, in order to get them for free, but Schuyler cleaned her plates in a cool 20. And with enough time to spare, Schuyler tried attacking a fourth steak but had to stop, saying she was tired of the taste. Schuyler was born and raised in Nebraska and currently residents in Sacramento California. Before her competitive food eating life, she worked as a bartender and server at Applebee\u2019s. In August 2012, Schuyler entered her first competitive eating competition, becoming the first woman to finish the Stellanator at Stella Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. The Stellanator includes six hamburger patties, six eggs, six pieces of cheese, six pieces of bacon topped with fried onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, two buns and mayonnaise. Another to add to the trophy cabinet: Schuyler pictured above winning the Z-Burger contest in Washington, DC last July. During the competition she ate 24 hamburgers in ten minutes . Since then, Schuyler has been competing regularly in food eating competitions - including one weekend in 2014 when she competed in FOUR food competitions. On January 31, 2014, Schuyler won Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia, by eating 363 wings. The next day, she competed in and won both the IHOP Pancake bowl and the bacon-eating contest at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines. She finished out the weekend by taking on the Adam Emmenecker Challenge at Jethro\u2019s Barbecue. Schuyler first took on the Emmenecker challenge in December 2012, when she became the first woman to complete the meal that includes a spicy pickle, bun, pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken tenders, white cheddar sauce, fried cheese cubes, Texas brisket, applewood smoked bacon, cheeseburger and a pound of waffle fries...in just 15 minutes. Dessert: Schuyler guzzles down\u00a012 pounds of rice pudding in three minutes to set a new world record last year . Hero: Last year Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland, Oregon . Schuyler started the competition at her normal 120 pounds, but by the time she was crowned winner, she had gained 15 pounds and her stomach noticeably filled out. Her physique was quite a contrast to the larger men who decided to take her on in the eating competition including a team of two professional wrestlers and two members of the Amarillo Venum indoor football team. For setting the record for fastest eaten steak dinner, Schuyler won $1,000 and another $5,000 for completing the challenge in less than an hour. What's more - Schuyler says she plans to come back next year and break her record, upping the ante to four steaks instead of three. Bobby Lee, the co-owner of the Big Texas, says the restaurant was floored by her performance and that they'll be submitting her record to Guinness. 'We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time- so this is a first for us and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal,' Lee told ABC 7. Schuyler started competing in eating competition in August 2012, and has broken several records during her brief career. In January 2014, she set ate 363 wings in just 20 minutes, earning $22,000 prize for that competition.",

If you're roasting a joint this Sunday, remember that thyme and red wine make perfect partners and don't forget to scrape the roasting dish for juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. And when looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts that have a good marbling of fat. Research by Asda has found that rump, fillet and T-Bone are the most popular cuts of meat when eating out but when we cook at home the majority of us (55 per cent) rely on burgers or mince. The supermarket's study also showed a showing lack of beef knowledge in the under 35's, which was highlighted further by the extensive knowledge of their senior counterparts. One in four youngsters think pocket and Y-bone are cuts of beef, whereas only a mere 3 per cent of over 55s fell for the fake cuts. In addition, this age bracket correctly identified shin (78 per cent) and skirt (72 per cent) as cuts of beef widely available across the UK but for the younger folk, those figures more than halved. Over a quarter of under 35's avoid trying unusual cuts of beef because they assume it will be too expensive while 30 per cent admitted they had never been shown how to cook a cut of beef. A fifth of 18-34-year-olds also admitted they find larger cuts of beef daunting to cook. Although half of Brits in their 20s would happily choose rump steak on the menu at a restaurant, they lack the confidence or know-how to cook it at home and therefore rely on the staples of mince and burgers to feed their beefy cravings. Neil Moorcroft buying manager for beef at Asda said: 'It's probably fair to say our grandparent's generation are more likely to have been brought up on a varied diet of beef cuts depending on what was available from the local butcher. 'However busy lifestyles and a shift in family mealtimes has altered this over the years, which is why it's become easy to fall into the same old shopping and cooking routines. 'But it's never too late to experiment and beef up those cooking skills, so if you get stuck just ask for tips at your local butcher's counter'. 'Bigger cuts of meat can be daunting, but they have great versatility, value for money and are definitely worth getting to grips with.' Best for Roasting . Preparing a roast can be daunting, but the cuts below are always a safe bet for any Sunday roast. Sirloin . Topside . Top Rump . Fillet . Get your roast on: . 1. Allow it to reach room temperature before cooking. 2. On a medium to high hob heat, seal the beef joint in a large frying pan with a touch of oil ensuring all sides are sealed by turning the joint every two to three minutes. 3. Transfer to a oven roasting dish and seasoning with salt and pepper, place into a preheated oven (190c/fan 170c) and allow to cook for 20 minutes per 500g for a juicy medium cooked joint. 4. Remove meat from roasting tray and allow to rest on a plate in a warm area for 15-20 minutes before serving use the roasting dish and juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. 5. Thyme and red wine is a perfect partner for roast beef. Best for Grilling . When looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts which have a good marbling of fat and also a tender joint which doesn't need to be beaten or stewed in order to bring out the flavours. Go for: . Flank . Skirt . Sirloin . Ribeye bone-in . Become a grill master: . 1. If you've bought a cheaper cut such as flank or top blade then marinating these meats first (overnight if possible) will really help to tenderize them . 2. Use a red hot grill pan which sizzles when you add the steak and try not to push it around or turn it too quickly if you want to create those famous griddle marks . 3. Similarly to a roast, let the steaks rest for five minutes before eating to allow meat to relax and become more tender. Best for Stewing . These cuts of beef are often the most cost effective because they require that extra bit of love and care in the kitchen, but don't let the time put you off. The flavours are well worth the wait for a tasty bubbling stew. Brisket . Shoulder . Beef ribs . Shank . Stew your way to success: . 1. Low and slow is the key phrase here, so get yourself a heavy bottomed casserole pot or slow cooker, and plenty of stock to allow for a long slow cook . 2. Preparation is easy, any veg can simply been thrown in at the start and left to bubble away . 3. Four hours should result in tender chunks of beef ready to accompany sides such as mash, dumplings or Yorkshire puds .",

And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate\u00a0Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate\u00a0Alec Shelbrooke in\u00a0Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were\u00a0left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.",

The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for \u00a3130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out \u00a3130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget \u00a319.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of \u00a319.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, \u00a3130:\u00a0Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene\u00a0and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the\u00a0Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At \u00a3130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of \u00a3130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, \u00a319.99:\u00a0The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for \u00a314.99 in 2013. Aldi's \u00a319.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty.\u00a0But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas:\u00a0The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the\u00a0Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At \u00a319.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the \u00a3130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.",

That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called \"Bali Nine.\" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, \"don't judge me too harshly.\"  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  \"A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, \"The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options.\" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the \"extensive rehabilitation\" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to \"use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.\"",

Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when\u00a0he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably\u00a0not his either. Instead, it records the\u00a0date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny'\u00a0Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return\u00a0the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'",

The secret document, which has the exact GPS co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the MoD's website. The details could be used as 'an invasion guide' by Argentina, with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any Argentine bombers sent to attack the islands. The Falklands Islands are defended by a squadron of RAF Typhoon aircraft operating from Mount Pleasant aerodrome on West Falkland, supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area . The aerodrome also operates as a Search and Rescue location with Sea King helicopters, pictured . The airstrip, pictured, is home to four Europfighter Typhoon aircraft tasked with defending the islands . The Aerodrome Manual was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the MoD's website and could have been downloaded by Argentine intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands. A senior military source told The Express: 'This is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get. 'It's practically an invasion handbook.\u00a0Taking out the runway could cripple Britain's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute.' The MoD admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled. They denied the information was particularly sensitive. The blunder occurred as Argentina was described as a 'very live threat' by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. This comes as Argentina is preparing to lease 12 Sukhoi SU-24 long-range bombers from Russia. The Falklands Islands are defended by modern Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, supported by Rapier surface-to-air missiles and 1,200 troops. The Royal Navy also patrols the area and nuclear-powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region. And the MoD recently announced the \u00a3228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences. The jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from Argentina in the event of a new conflict . Argentina is considering leasing 12 Suhkoi SU-24 bombers, pictured, from Russia. The Cold War-era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb Mount Pleasant without the need to refuel . The MoD published the Aerodrome Manual on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone . The Cold War-era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the Falklands Islands and return to Argentina without the need to refuel. It also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air-to-air missiles. The jets, despite being designed in the 1960s, are also capable of supersonic travel. This comes as tensions between Britain and Argentina have increased over plans by UK firms to drill for oil in the South Atlantic. Argentina's minister for the Malivinas - the name it uses for the Falklands Islands - Daniel Filmus threatened to prosecute any British firms exploring for oil near the islands. He said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the Falklands Islands' continental shelf, which we reject, and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities. 'We are satisfied that the Islands have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies, and will continue to support them as they move forward. Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands.'",

A single father of four was crowned MasterChef champion last night, fulfilling a dream to become a chef that he has nurtured since he was eight. Simon Wood, 38, battled it out against Emma Spitzer and Tony Rodd as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours. The final followed seven weeks of tough challenges, including the 'chef's table', which involved cooking one of three courses on a menu set up by Italian chef Massimo Bottura. It brings to an end the eleventh series of the popular BBC weekly amateur cooking contest. Mr Wood, a data manager from Oldham in Greater Manchester, served a starter of octopus with chorizo and cannellini beans followed by a main of squab pigeon served two ways with blackberry sauce, watercress puree and carrots. He finished with a dessert of lemon posset topped with seven garnishes \u2013 citrus tutti-frutti, charred grapefruit and orange, a lime tuile, limoncello pistachio crumb, edible flowers, tarragon leaves and a lime air. After he presented the dishes to the judges, Torode said: 'Do you know why I love you? Because you take something quite ordinary and make it special.' Wallace said: 'Simon is brilliant, he's an incredible talent.' After being crowned the winner, Mr Wood said: 'I'm shaking inside, it's so surreal, I can't begin to describe how happy I am. It's life changing.' Finalist Mr Rodd, 33, is an architectural recruitment consultant from London, while Miss Spitzer is the managing director of a luxury travel business and mother to four daughters under nine. Finalists: Simon Wood, 38, right, battled it out against Emma Spitzer, left, and Tony Rodd, centre, as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours . Mr Wood said: 'I have been cooking since I could reach the top of the oven, and I always cooked at weekends with my grandma. 'When I was eight I won a competition where the prize was to have your dream job for the day and mine was to be a chef. Thirty years later who would have thought I would have the MasterChef trophy in my hands.' Momentous: Kim Woodward is the first woman to be appointed head chef at the Savoy Grill . A former MasterChef semi-finalist has become the first woman to run the prestigious Savoy Grill kitchen in its 126-year history. Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at the famous venue, which has hosted lunches for the likes of prime ministers, musicians and captains of industry for decades. The 34-year-old follows in the footsteps of a string of ma\u00eetre chefs who have headed the kitchen since its opening in the Strand, London in 1889. Ms Woodward, who lives in Camden, said: \u2018It is an absolute honour for me to be the head chef here in one of London\u2019s most iconic restaurants. Obviously there is so much history here, and the people who come through the door come here for the classic dishes that the Grill is famous for.\u2019 At the five-star, art deco Grill, which is now part of the Gordon Ramsay stable, Woodward will head a team of about 35 chefs, of whom some 40 per cent are women. It marks her return to the venue \u2014 she was a sous chef between 2010 and 2012, before becoming head chef at the York & Albany gastropub in Camden. She reached the semi-final of the 2011 series of MasterChef: The Professionals.",

Council inspectors found a shocking state of hygiene at The Steer Inn in Wilberfoss, East Yorkshire - and owner David Crossfield later admitted 17 charges of breaching food safety regulations. Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date. Shocking:\u00a0Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy (above) and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date . In addition, raw meat was being prepared in direct contact with ready to eat salad items posing a serious risk of cross contamination, Beverley Magistrates\u2019 Court was told. Inspectors - who first visited in January 2014 - also found kitchen equipment was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair, and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning. Meanwhile food safety systems, monitoring checks and procedures were not in place - and food handlers were found to consistently demonstrate a lack of understanding of food safety issues. Crossfield, 52, of Elvington, North Yorkshire - whom magistrates branded \u2018foolish\u2019 - also admitted failing to comply with a hygiene improvement notice requiring food hygiene training for his staff. Mouldy food and dirty floor: Inspectors found kitchen equipment at The Steer Inn was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning . Crossfield said he was the sole director of The Steer Inn (Pocklington) Ltd and had admitted he had taken over the running of the premises with no knowledge of running a kitchen or a restaurant. He said he had been worked in pubs and bars \u2018with no problems before\u2019 and he had been \u2018naive\u2019 and had been led to believe the chef had the right qualifications relating to food hygiene. Crossfield told the court that The Steer Inn had ceased trading on New Year\u2019s Eve 2014 and that he was in the process of liquidating the company, which had no assets. Chair of the bench Graham McDonald told him: \u2018These were appalling offences.\u00a0People could have become seriously ill or even died as a result of salmonella. East Yorkshire restaurant:\u00a0The company was fined \u00a38,500, plus costs of \u00a31,392 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120. Its owner was individually fined \u00a32,750, as well as costs of \u00a31,392 and a \u00a3120 victim surcharge . \u2018Your naivety was dangerous and the fact you relied on your chef was extremely foolish.\u2019 The company was fined \u00a38,500, plus costs of \u00a31,392 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120. Crossfield was individually fined \u00a32,750, as well as costs of \u00a31,392 and a \u00a3120 victim surcharge. Paul Abbott, manager for public protection at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said: \u2018The council\u2019s food safety team had offered considerable advice to the food business operator of the premises in an attempt to produce safe food but despite being rated a zero under the food hygiene rating scheme, he had failed to make meaningful improvements. He added that the council \u2018will always try to work with businesses to ensure the food they sell is safe and they are compliant with the relevant legislation'.",

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'",

Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that \"Doe 3\" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a \"sex slave\" and made \"her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people.\" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, \"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case \"is all about money\" and \"completely made up.\" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said \"lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably.\" \"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,\" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report.",

John Apter said: 'I saw an officer wearing the uniform during a training day at the Hampshire Constabulary headquarters. 'I initially thought the uniform was inside out. I then spoke to an another officer who said he was given one which was exactly the same. 'It was an error by the manufacturing company but it is funny that some of the officers have to decided to wear them. 'It boosts morale within the force because it's funny to see. Three officers were given them and I heard one of them sent it back to the manufacturing firm.\u00a0Who knows, they could be worth some money in the future.' Mr Apter said the officers will only wear the uniforms 'internally' and not when they are patrolling the area. He added: 'It makes people simile and I'm sure the uniforms will inject a bit of morale into the police force. Although it is an unfortunate error, hopefully people can see the funny side of it.'

HIV specialists and network security experts at University College London (UCL) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads . They worked together to build a model for this 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off AIDS. Scroll down for video . Researchers creates a model 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say the spread was similar to a computer virus . HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. The teams noticed that the spread of HIV through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. Lead author Changwang Zhang, of UCL, said: 'HIV and Conficker have a lot in common. 'They both use hybrid spreading mechanisms, persist for a very long time and are incredibly difficult to eradicate. 'Our model enables us to explain these important properties and to predict the infection process.' Changwang's supervisor co-author Dr Shi Zhou said: 'Although the cybersecurity community organised an unprecedented collaboration to tackle Conficker, they still failed to eliminate Conficker from the Internet. 'HIV researchers face a similar problem. We hope that our new understanding of hybrid epidemics will help us to fight against Conficker and HIV.' Detailed sample data from 17 HIV patients from London were used to verify the model, showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for HIV progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment. HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. Co-senior author Professor Benny Chain, of UCL, said: 'The number of HIV cells in the bloodstream is always relatively low, and our model shows that HIV spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause AIDS. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. 'It is likely that when HIV gains a foothold somewhere with a high T-cell population, such as the gut, it uses a cell-to-cell transfer mechanism to efficiently spread directly between them. As such, if HIV has already spread to an area rich in T-cells by the time treatment begins, preventing its spread through the bloodstream will not stop AIDS. 'Our model suggests that completely blocking cell-to-cell transfer would prevent progression to AIDS, highlighting the need to develop new treatments.' Laboratory research, led by co-senior author Dr Clare Jolly, has previously shown that some drugs are better than others at stopping HIV from spreading directly between cells. However, it's not possible to directly measure cell-to-cell spread in patients because it takes place inside internal organs. Dr Jolly said: 'With this new model, we should be able to assess the effectiveness of drugs against different modes of HIV spread in real patients. 'This could prove invaluable when interpreting the results of drug trials to understand what works and why. Using computer models to understand processes that we cannot directly observe is common in the physical sciences and supports many fundamental theories. 'Our model provides strong evidence that cell-to-cell spread is an important part of HIV spread, and we hope to show this directly in future animal studies.'.",

The dsiturbing video shows a mystery clawed creature  biting through a steel cage with a visibly bleeding mouth . According to the video description, the animal was discovered swimming in Shenzhen Reservoir in China's Sand Bay. It was reportedly fished out of the water by workers from the Department of Drainage, who later captured the animal in a steel cage. The clip has sparked heated debates on Chinese social media site WeiBo, with some users claiming it depicts a 'water monster' from Chinese folklore. Other users alluded to the creature being impacted by pollution, with Shenzhen Reservoir being recently deluged with toxic sewerage that turned parts of the region blood red. Some claimed it was in fact a Malaysian Bear who was suffering from alopecia, a disease which causes baldness.

The video has been the subject of heated online debates over the species of the animal, with some users claiming it is a mythical 'water monster' and others that it's a diseased Malaysian Bear . A similar video surfaced in January of an ailing sun bear in Borneo island in Malaysia, which had been beaten by local plantation workers and driven into the bush. It was reported this month that the animal was discovered at another nearby plantation, where it is being nursed back to health. David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia the caged animal 'looks like a bear cub which is suffering from some medical condition which has caused it to loose all of its fur.' While he was unable to confirm if it was the same bear from the Borneo clip, he said he suspects it is and that the footage originates from Borneo not China. A heavily-polluted field in\u00a0Shenzhen Reservoir, where the mystery beats was apparently captured, has fuelled accusations the animal may have been contaminated .

It\u2019s a system that leaves Real Madrid short in midfield especially when you consider none of the first choice midfield trio are defensive players. This plays perfectly into Atletico\u2019s hands. Diego Simeone will flood the midfield on Tuesday night as he has done in recent meetings between the two sides and see if his 4-4-2 with Arda Turan, Mario Suarez, Gabi and Koke can\u2019t over-run Rodriguez, Luka Modric in midfield. Atletico\u2019s two banks of four are also very good at closing the space down for Bale, Ronaldo and Benzema. No wonder Ancelotti said on Monday that playing Simeone\u2019s team is always a problem.

Simeone\u2019s burns more calories on the touchline than some of his players while Ancelotti\u2019s activity tends to get no more anaerobic than opening another packet of chewing gum. The Italian has won the lot in club football, Simeone is on his way to equaling that feat \u2013 he has already won the league and cup in Spain, and the European and Spanish Super Cups along with the Europa League. He almost got the European Cup last year but Ancelotti denied him. For as long as the pair stay in Spain their futures will be linked. Diego Simeone raises his players one game at a time and the games against Real Madrid are no difference . Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti and Atletico boss Simeone often have their careers compared . The Real stars against the team with no stars . When Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico Madrid in the league in February it wasn\u2019t the Atletico players who went out partying. Real\u2019s players are the footballing glitterati and Ronaldo\u2019s high-profile birthday bash was part of that. Atletico\u2019s players take great joy in beating their pin-up rivals. Mario Mandzukic, Diego Godin and Raul Garcia are happy to play it ugly if it gets results. Diego Godin and Mario Mandzukic are happy to play ugly to achieve winning results for their side . Goals and golazos . Koke\u2019s thunderbolt shots, the inspiration of Turan, a moment\u2019s magic from Antoine Griezmann \u2013 Atletico Madrid are about more than just graft. And with Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema, James Rodriguez and Isco all capable of moments of brilliance the derbies have thrown up their fair share of great goals. Ronaldo and Gareth Bale's moments of brilliance have thrown up their fair share of goals in the game . Atletico Madrid's Turkish midfielder Arda Turan has scored his fair share of wondergoals in his career . Well-matched . They used to hold a sarcastic banner up behind the goal at the Santiago Bernabeu for the Madrid derby. It was written like a classified ad and read: \u2018wanted \u2013 decent rival for city derby\u2019. Those days are long gone. Atletico Madrid ended a 14-year run of not beating Real when they won the Copa del Rey against them two years ago. Sergio Ramos celebrates a goal against his rivals in the Champions League final in Portugal . The game is a chance for Simeone to get his own back on Ancelotti for the defeat in what is to date their only meeting in European competition. Although some would say with four wins and two draws in the six games in other competitions between the two since then, he has already done that. And they haven\u2019t looked back since. At the start of the season they beat them in the Spanish Super Cup and knocked them out of the Copa del Rey both times over two legs. The one blip in the recent run came when it mattered most in last year\u2019s Champions League final and they will hope to put that right on Tuesday night. Most City derbies have one side up and the other down \u2013 right now Atletico as Spanish Champions and Real as European Champions are a match for each other in every sense. Bale celebrates when it counts most as he scores in the Champions League final in Portugal in 2014 .",

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'",

Liverpool sold star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona for \u00a375million during the summer . 'The role he played tonight was the false nine we speak about a lot,' Carragher told Sky Sports after the Barclays Premier League match. 'We expect him in a wide area, but we saw some of his touches tonight and his ability in small spaces against players, some of the pieces of play he produced tonight. 'Last season Luis Suarez was Liverpool's main man, the go-to man. But as this season has progressed, and for the future, Coutinho is Liverpool's.'

Nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on May 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s. Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservatives, narrowly topped the polls assessing who 'won' the two-hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for Britain. Crucially, 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed Cameron as 'the most impressive' on the subject of the economy, which lies at the heart of each party's campaign. But pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be Cameron or the Labour Party's Ed Miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast. Scroll down for video . The build-up: Prime Minister David Cameron went head-to-head with six other party leaders in a TV debate on Thursday night in an unusual format for Britain. It comes six weeks ahead of the general election on May 7 . Neck-and-neck: Cameron was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out Miliband (right) Nicola Sturgeon, of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate, which also featured the environment-focused Green Party, led by Natalie Bennett, and Wales' Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party completed the line-up. Analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a 'killer line' that would set them apart from the other participants. 'There was clearly no knock-out blow,' said Peter Kellner of pollster YouGov. Jonny Tudor, 17, who asked one of the questions on the night, said afterwards: 'Some performed well in answer to certain questions, other performed well on different subjects, but there was no definitive winner.' A rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted Cameron to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets. Too close to call? Pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the Labour Party's Ed Miliband (left) or David Cameron (right) in the top job after votes are cast. But polls named Cameron as last night's debate 'winner' Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . Rare moment of drama: A woman stood up during the debate to heckle Cameron about homelessness . But in a result that will calm Conservative nerves, a Comres/ITV poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged Cameron was the most capable of leading Britain, compared to 28 per cent who named Miliband. The event was the first and only full TV debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters, many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy. It is the only time Cameron and Miliband will go head-to-head on issues of policy before votes are cast. In one of Cameron's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance, he pointed to his rivals, one-by-one, and said: 'What I'm hearing is more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes, some more debt and more taxes, and definitely more debt and more taxes.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was forced to reference mistakes he made in the last five years in coalition .

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nArsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if \u00a330million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer . Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November . Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal \u00a330m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 . Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career . But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over \u00a330m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year . He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September . The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season . Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season . Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters .",

The survey, by flea treatment brand Frontline Spot On, also found that people favoured different types of dog depending on where they lived. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 41 per cent of Londoners preferred small dogs who don\u2019t take up much room. Meanwhile almost a fifth of owners in East Anglia, with its swathes of countryside, picked the large great dane as their favourite breed.

Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) rather than a retriever-sized pooch (34 per cent). Meanwhile, those in East Anglia prefer Great Danes (19 per cent) over tiny dogs like Chihuahuas (4 per cent). A quarter of owners valued their pet\u2019s companionship so much they said the perfect dog would live for as long as they did \u2013 instead of the normal lifespan of around ten to 13 years. The survey also asked about the ideal dog\u2019s sound, with 30 per cent opting for the \u2018mid-range\u2019 bark of a labrador as opposed to a high-pitched yap. Brock Abreu, Frontline Spot On brand manager, said: \u2018When it comes to our ideal canine companion, looks really do matter. \u2018It is also great to see that we are being patriotic and championing those traditional and beautiful British dog breeds.\u2019 Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) than a larger retreiver .",

Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either \u2018incredibly naive or totally incompetent\u2019 by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank\u2019s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for \u2018a further one-year period\u2019 before leaving the bank\u2019s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that \u2018no decision has been taken at this time\u2019. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: \u2018You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.\u2019 Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC\u2019s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax.

Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than \u00a3500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC\u2019s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC\u2019s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that \u2018frontline\u2019 staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank\u2019s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: \u2018We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.\u2019 But Mrs Hodge responded that to \u2018simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose\u2019. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role\u00a0over her HSBC role . Her likely departure from HSBC comes as the bank is planning for a wider clearout of non-executives who have been on the board for a long period of time.",

But it was Tony Abbott's response to her transformation from man to woman that knocked her for six. It took less than an hour for the federal Liberal leader to call Ms McGregor after she forwarded the chapter of her book that outed her. Ms McGregor recalled that very moment - during her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday - when the prime minister told her 'it was okay'. 'I actually said to him \"your party won't be thrilled about this\",' she said, the ABC reports. However the senior military official did not express the same kind of appraisal when it came to Mr Abbott's stance on same-sex marriage, saying she is 'sad' that he is not a supporter of it. Scroll down for video . Cate McGregor - now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force - spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) publicly backed McGregor (right) by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman . Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says. 'There is a kind of a firefighter buried inside the politician still and he tends to barge into burning buildings if his friends are in there.' Mr Abbott publicly backed his friend by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman. Ms McGregor, now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm. In 2012, after years of drowning agonising pain with alcohol and drugs, McGregor stopped 'functioning' as a man and chose to live as a woman. She tried to resign from the office of former Chief of Army David Morrison when her transformation became public. He refused her resignation. 'It was easier to tell David Morrison I was transgendered than I was going to become an air force officer,' she said. 'I love the Army for that.' Mr Abbott sits with Ms McGregor to commentate during the International tour match between the Prime Minister's XI and England at Manuka Oval in Canberra last year . The senior officer addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series . McGregor a senior officer knows she's 'benefited enormously' from male privilege. But she'd willingly sacrifice it all to have lived as a woman from her early 20s. The cricket commentator, columnist and former staffer to Bob Carr, addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series. At times, she became tearful. But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.' The ABC did however report that she said: 'He's not a supporter of gay marriage, I'm sad about that.'",

The young midfielder was clearly in awe of the former World Cup winning striker and simply wrote 'legend' alongside the picture on Instagram. Ronaldo, who scored more than 100 goals for Real and netted an impressive 62 international goals, was visiting his old club ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.

There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia. In a documentary aired today  on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying. Putin also expressed his fears that the West wishes Russia harm as he recalled how some world leaders told him they would not mind Russia's possible disintegration. 'My counterparts, a lot of presidents and prime ministers told me later on that they had decided for themselves by then that Russia would cease to exist in its current form,' he said. 'The only question was when it happens and what consequences would be.'",

But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby,\u00a0when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level, \u00a0measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide . No clue: Local residents on Hokkaido island say they felt no tremors overnight, or heard any sounds to indicate movement, and that the landmass just appeared . New view: Local residents from Rausu, Hokkaido, take a look at the newly emerged coastline . Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline, but they do not expect it to expand further, said an official at the central government's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives.

Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.",

Turning right the train enters another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers.

In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Will Stack, a 22-year-old U.S. Army National Guardsman, recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in the state's Lexington County. He explains how he was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse on Wednesday, to make a left turn, when he decided to use the empty median lane to access the left turn lane, which was full. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're bad': Will Stack, 22, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, has released a video (pictured) disputing claims that all white officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color' Moments later, he was stopped by the cop for 'improper use of the median'. 'He told me what I did, asked for my license and registration, I gave that to him,' Mr Stack says in the selfie-style video. He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook\u00a0page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story.

He says he was given a warning after doing everything the cop said . Praise: Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented (above) on Mr Stack's selfie-style video, with many praising him for his honesty amid a national scandal over alleged police brutality . Mixed opinion: Although many of the users' comments were positive, others were negative (as seen bottom) 'The point of this is to say that I am an African-American male, this gentleman was Caucasian. There were no problems. He did his job, I did what I was supposed to do, and that was it,' he says. 'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?' Mr Stack captured the video just days after North Charleston officer Michael Slager was arrested for murder for allegedly shooting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away. Serviceman: 'I feel like people need to understand... not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims,' says Mr Stack (pictured left and right) Scene: Mr Stack was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse (above) when he was pulled over by the cop . He told WIS that although he had concerns over the use of force  applied by Officer Slager, 33, he was keeping an open mind about the shooting - and did not believe Scott should have tried to flee. Speaking to the station, Mr Stack, who recently completed a deployment with the National Guard and is now job hunting, said: ' It's possible for African Americans and police officers to get along. 'And, not everybody shares the same mindset because nobody's the same, everybody's different.' Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented on Mr Stack's video, with many praising him for his honesty amid the national scandal over alleged police\u00a0brutality. Natashalynn Hoag told him: 'Amazingly said!!!!!!! Agreed 100% You have a GREAT head on your shoulders! You were raised wonderfully, your family should be VERY proud of you!!!' And Tina Wisecup Wills wrote: 'Such wise words. Thank you for taking the time to share them.' Shooting: Mr Stack captured the video with the knowledge of North Charleston officer Michael Slager's (right) arrest for murder after he allegedly shot Water Scott (left), 50, five times in the back as he was running away.",

Police in Ragusa, a Sicilian port town, arrested three Syrian men who were at the helm of the Turkish-flagged yacht attempting to reach the Italian coast. It is thought the smugglers had charged each person $8,500 (\u00a35,700) to make the crossing, with police saying the total earned by the organisers was somewhere in the region of \u00a3536,000. Scroll down for video . The luxury yacht, which was flying a Turkish flag, was stopped as it approached Europe with a 'cargo' which is thought to have been worth $800,000 - or \u00a3536,000 - to the organisers . This is far more than the usual cost of\u00a0between 1,000 and 1,500 euros - \u00a3720 to \u00a31,080 - to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. However, the boat was far more seaworthy than some of the other vessels used, which can be anything from\u00a0wooden fishing vessels to old cargo ships. Yet even the yacht failed to make the journey in its entirety: the attempt was discovered when two merchant ships were called out to aid a boat in distress. Selfies and other photos snapped by the Syrian and Palestinian passengers helped police identify the smugglers, police said in a statement. Police also revealed there were 23 children on bard the yacht. Harroum Almotassem Billah,\u00a0Haj Slima Moustafa and\u00a0Sabaj Ahmmed were all arrested for allegedly being part of the crew. Harroum Almotassem Billah, one of the three Syrians that were taken in custody by police for allegedly being part of the crew which was at the helm of the yacht . Haj Slima Moustafa was also taken into custody after the yacht - filled with Syrian and Palestinian migrants who paid $8,500 each for the journey - called for help as it approached the coast . Sabaj Ahmmed was the third member of the alleged crew attempting to bring the migrants, including 23 children, to Europe . The boat is the latest vessel to be stopped making the dangerous crossing from north Africa to Europe, packed with migrants desperate to start a new life. But many of the trips end in tragedy: so far this year, 1,776 have died, according to the U.N. refugee agency, which estimates that 219,000 people made the crossing in 2014. On Sunday alone, 900 men, women and children are believed to have died after their boat got into difficulty and overturned off Libyan waters, south of the southern Italian island of Lampedusa. There were only 28 survivors. These infrared images show the rescue operation after migrant ship capsized on Sunday . Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . Doctor Giuseppe Pomilla, of the Order of Malta, described the three hours he searched for the living among hundreds of dead floating corpses. He told the MailOnline: 'It was like a nightmare. It was a cemetery. There were bodies everywhere you looked.'",

One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette\u00a0reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher \u2013 you can\u2019t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.' It is not known at this time as to the nationality or the exact actions of the two passengers arrested . A spokesperson for Thomson Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by passengers on board flight TOM022 from London Gatwick Airport to Cancun, which diverted to Bermuda yesterday due to a customer incident on board. 'We operate a zero tolerance policy in relation to any disruptive behaviour. The passengers in question were removed from the aircraft and met by police. 'The flight departed within two hours to ensure the other customers could get away on their holiday as soon as possible. 'Customer safety is our priority at all times and we would like to reassure passengers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'",

Police exhumed the boy's body from his grave in Norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review. A DNA sample eventually led them to his mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988, just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a Sunday afternoon outing. Scroll down for video . Unsolved case: A police officer searches Windmill Pit, the Norfolk pond where the baby boy's body was found back in 1988 . The boy's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review, with DNA samples leading police to the boy's mother. He has now been reburied at Weasenham St Peter church, Norfolk . Police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at 13th century St Peter's Church in the village. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . But after the body was exhumed in April last year, DNA taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said: 'It came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age. 'We went to see that individual and she told us she was mum. She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. 'We were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her. 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' The woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond, known locally as Windmill Pit, before it was found by a group of teenagers. The boy was originally buried without a name but \u00a0a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church . A second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play. An inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death. The baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named Peter after the name of the church. Det Insp Guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He added: 'This has been unsolved for 27 years. By using the latest techniques, we've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time.' 'We don't ever give up. All the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they're reviewed at regular intervals.' Det Insp Guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' A support group called Hana's Gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter. The inscription reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today . Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'",

But at the same time he claimed that overall caps on net migration \u2013 as pledged by the Tories \u2013 would be \u2018ludicrous\u2019 because it was impossible to stop people leaving the country. Ukip\u2019s manifesto chief later added to the confusion by saying the 50,000 limit \u2018might change every year\u2019. Confusion over Ukip\u2019s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year . The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration. Ukip first unveiled an immigration cap in February, with spokesman Stephen Woolfe saying the numbers being granted visas limited at 50,000. But at the start of March, Mr Farage overturned this by saying he would not set \u2018arbitrary targets\u2019. At the end of the month, the Ukip leader spoke of a net migration limit of \u2018about 30,000 people a year\u2019. Charlie Elphicke, the Tory candidate in Dover, said: \u2018Ukip\u2019s immigration policy doesn\u2019t just change by the day, it changes by the minute in the space of one interview. It\u2019s complete chaos. \u2018The truth is with Nigel Farage, you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. The only certainty is that a vote for Ukip lets Ed Miliband limp into Downing Street via the backdoor - and then there will be no action on immigration.\u2019 Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme yesterday, Mr Farage said about his party\u2019s cap: \u2018It\u2019s below 50,000 a year, all right? It\u2019s below 50,000 a year. Simple as that. The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration . \u2018But this whole debate we\u2019ve been tied up with caps for five years. It\u2019s devalued the debate. What we\u2019re not actually addressing is the fact that 624,000 people settled in Britain last year and that we have no control over the numbers that settle this year or next year. \u2018Let\u2019s be honest, we cannot have any debate about immigration about numbers while we\u2019re members of the European Union.\u2019 Later in the day, Suzanne Evans, Ukip\u2019s manifesto chief, said the level of the cap might change. She told the BBC News channel: \u2018If we say, we have 21,000 highly skilled people coming from outside of the EU, where there is already a points based system, then we will talk to the businesses, that\u2019s where we get our 50,000 limit from, but that might change every year.\u2019",

In  ISIS's most recent video, a young doctor, identified as Tareq Kamleh, called on foreign medics to travel to the ISIS stronghold in Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service). The video of Kamleh, who refers to himself as Abu Yusuf, showed him handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. Scroll down for video . The blue-eyed Australian doctor who features in the latest IS propaganda video has been identified as\u00a0Tareq Kamleh . Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh introduces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . Once the propaganda video went viral, people from Kamleh's past started to recognise the previously unidentified doctor. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University. Upon completing his degree he reportedly worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. Kamleh then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, the Age reported. He completed his final stint in the Australian medical system working in Perth until late 2014. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University . 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests' A university student who knew Kamleh, but did not want to be named, said he showed no signs that he would defect to the radical militant group. 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests,' she told\u00a0news.com.au. She said the 'clean cut' doctor was well known in her social circle as a 'womaniser' who didn't shy away from drinking alcohol. Kamleh was also recognised by Dr Stephen Napoli, co-owner of the Mannum Medical Centre in South Australia. He told the Age\u00a0the 'intelligent' doctor had interned with him for 10 weeks back in 2010. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge,' Dr Napoli said. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge' Kamleh was known to practice medicine in Adelaide, Mackay and finally in Perth before he took up working for IS . Dr Napoli agreed that Kamleh had shown no signs of holding extreme Islamic views. 'There was no indication I'd be worried about his other associations when he was with us. 'There was nothing that I saw of his work as a medical practical that would suggest he would have any of these sorts of views.' The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic\u00a0Britain's National Health Service . A former college from Adelaide Hospital also came forward reporting that he recognised Kamleh in the footage immediately. 'I was taken aback as much because I certain certainly wouldn't have associated him with an association like IS. His principle seemed to be sound and focused on the care of his patients,' he told the Age. The collegue, who also chose not to be identified, said Kamleh's behaviours were not consistent with the Islamic State's conservative views on drinking or dating. 'I know he dated a few nurses and other doctors over the years\u2026 he was heterosexual and certainly interested in the ladies, with some success.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The video featuring Kamleh, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows the doctor interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,' he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. 'It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. 'We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . 'The video is interesting because it's trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.' 'In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.' Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. 'They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren't trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?' Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas.

The footage, which appeared on social media on Thursday, comes after nine Brritish medical students travelled to Syria last month, claiming they were going to help treat victims of the civil war. The students are all believed to be of Sudanese origin and were studying at a medical school in Khartoum, Sudan. The students have been named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir. In February, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis announced an $18 million initiative to battle extremist propaganda. The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of technology experts to assess the impact of online extremist propaganda. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages.",

'I always hope to get the best out of my team, but no manager in the world if he is serious can predict a run like this,' Wenger told Arsenal's website. 'In the Premier League it's very difficult to predict.' Arsene Wenger admits he could not have predicted Arsenal's impressive run of results . Aaron Ramsey's goal against Burnley extended the Gunners' record to 16 wins in their last 18 games . Wenger has once again come under fire this season, with fans frustrated by Arsenal's failure to mount a serious title challenge and another last-16 exit in the Champions League. However, with an FA Cup semi-final this weekend and still the chance to chase down Chelsea in the table, Wenger's position at Arsenal is again looking secure. Arsenal have won 16 of 18 games in all competitions and Wenger believes the change in fortune is down to him finally having a relatively injury-free squad. 'It's down to the quality and the attitude of the team, the quality of the spirit we have in the side,' he said.

They are the heart of the home, the hub of dinner parties and usually the \u2018debrief of the day\u2019 meeting room. So what makes a great kitchen? It\u2019s a balance between a warm and inviting design combined with practical efficiency. After judging the kitchens on The Block last week and taking into account what buyers look for in a kitchen, property buyers expert Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design. Activity based design: . The key to ensuring the practicality of your kitchen is to zone areas of the kitchen based on activities e.g. food preparation, cooking, clean-up etc. with storage for those activities within those zones. These areas need to be easily accessible to each other and flow well (e.g. food preparation near the cooking area etc.). There\u2019s no use in a pretty kitchen when your preparation area is on the opposite end of the kitchen from your stovetop. Bench space: . This is one of the most common bugbears when buyers are looking at kitchens. Enough bench/counter space is crucial not only for food preparation but also for serving when entertaining. Scroll down for video . There was plenty of bench space in Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen on The Block . Storage space: . Plenty of storage space is essential and you need to find a good balance between design aesthetics and practicality. Take into account what\u2019s most important for you in terms of storage, as I recommended a Walk-in pantry vs a Butler\u2019s pantry, consider whether having extra space for preparation and a large area to hide your appliances is paramount to you or whether a larger area for food storage is more vital. Judge Neale Whitaker said\u00a0Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual\u00a0the flare, confidence or pizzazz' Sufficient lighting: . As the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Jury discussed when viewing Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen, it\u2019s not an area of the home that you can get away with the \u2018bare bones\u2019 when it comes to lighting. For the purpose of safety in food preparation and cooking, good lighting is paramount. Specifically in the preparation, cooking and cleaning areas, it\u2019s essential to have good quality lighting. Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen lacked lighting above the benchtop according to\u00a0Frank Valentic . Splash backs: . In the cooking and cleaning zones of the kitchen, splashbacks are important and while design is also important, it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of practicality. Try and find a good medium between something that looks great but is also low maintenance and easy to clean! The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background . Ventilation: . Akin to the bathroom, the kitchen requires great ventilation so ensure you have a good quality range hood and windows that can be opened. Valentic says there was 'great ventilation' in Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchen . Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges . Flow on: . The overall design of your home really needs to come into play when designing a kitchen. The flow between the living areas, specifically dining areas and the kitchen are important. As we mentioned when judging Jess and Ayden\u2019s and Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchens, a kitchen with a flow on to an outdoor entertaining area is very much in demand at the moment and a huge plus for buyers. Jess and Ayden\u2019s kitchen had a 'great flow' on from the living and dining areas . Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win and add $10,000 to their kitty . Valentic's example of a kitchen at 12 Kyarra Street in Hampton that would attract buyers' attention . Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design . In the end, Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen for the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Judges showed the best balance between design and a practical layout. While a kitchen is a very personal area of the home, make sure to take into account re-sale when renovating so that it doesn\u2019t affect the value of your property when you re-sell it. However,\u00a0if The Block: Triple Threat judges were the buyers this week, they would have walked away from each of the team's apartments without placing an offer. Judging trio Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer were all left largely unimpressed by the kitchens delivered by the Blockheads on last Sunday night's episode. The lacklustre performance, in the eye of the judges, meant that Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win of the series and add $10,000 to their kitty. The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background. Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges. Meanwhile, Whitaker said Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual the flare, confidence or pizzazz'. The living area, dining room, and kitchen flow onto the outdoor entertaining space .",

He is being fed three times a day at the dairy farm where he was born, in Narnaul, northern India. Scroll down for video . On everyone's lips: This calf in northern India has five mouths and is attracting a stream of human visitors . Normal body: From the neck down the baby, who has been called Nandi, looks like any other calf . Dinner time: Nandi sucks from his mother's udders with one of his mouths. She feeds him three times a day . Shocked locals have called the calf Nandi - a nickname for Lord Krishna. It can also mean 'one who pleases others'. In India's Hindu culture, cows are revered as a symbol of life. Nandi is attracting a constant stream of visitors wanting to celebrate him. Many of them kneel before him to pray and touch his hooves. Local vet Sukhbir Singh said that despite Nandi's appearance, he is healthy and thriving.\u00a0But the calf's two eyes are positioned in such a way on his distorted head that he can only see to his sides and can't look in front of him.

Celebrating him: Local schoolchildren kneel and pray at Nandi's feet. Cows are revered in the Hindu faith . Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads\u00a0but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too. Two-faced: This 440kg bull, which has faces on top of each other, was sold to an abattoir last month . Double-headed: The female calf born that was born in Whiting, Vermont, two years ago .

Hernandez has only started twice in La Liga for Carlo Ancleotti's side and faces the near-impossible task of earning a regular starting spot with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale ahead of him in the pecking order. The striker will return to Manchester United at the end of the season but does not feature in manager Louis van Gaal's plans and will only have one year left on his contract at the Old Trafford club. Meanwhile, LA Galaxy and proposed new franchise LAFC are being considered by Ronaldo as possible destinations when his contract ends at Real Madrid. Ronaldo, 30, is contracted to Madrid until 2018.",

During a lesson on tolerance and acceptance, children at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point were read I Am Jazz, a book about\u00a0a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender. Some parents are unhappy with the school after they say their children came home with questions about gender and wondering if they too might be trans. I Am Jazz is a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender . One unnamed mom was so angry she contacted conservative pundit Sean Hannity after she felt that the school ignored her initial complaint. 'I feel like my thoughts, feelings and beliefs were completely ignored\u2026.My right as a parent to allow or not allow this discussion with my child was taken from me. It is very upsetting to me that I didn't have an option at all,' she told\u00a0Hannity.com. 'When I spoke with the principal he was very cold about it. It's amazing how thoughtless the school has been with this whole thing.' The mother claims that lesson prompted her 7-year-old son to start asking a lot of questions and questioning if he might be trans - something that he had never previously spoken about. 'I was taken aback by it\u2026 Being seven, once you put something in their mind they don't forget so easily,' she said. In the wake of Hannity contacting the school asking for clarity, officals have now apologized. Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, said she supported the reading of the book but admitted that parents should have been first notified. Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues . Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, admitted that parents should have been first notified . 'We have a practice of if a topic is considered sensitive, parents should be informed. In this situation, that didn't happen,' she said. 'The whole culture at Mitchell School is about teaching tolerance and respect. The people presenting the lesson thought [I Am Jazz] was one more piece of teaching that lesson. In retrospect, we understand that toleration is tolerating people of all opinions.' But at least one parents has come out in support of the school's initial decision to select the book as appropiate for teaching young students. 'People in this country, parents in this country are outraged by bullying, teen suicide rates and the depression in children. The staff of Mitchell School is doing something about this. By teaching acceptance and love they are shedding a light on [LGBTI] issues,' reports Gay Star News. 'LGBTQ issues should never be classified as a \"sensitive subject\" \u2014 there is nothing sensitive about the way we are born. Blonde hair, brown hair, gay, straight or somewhere in-between, we are all people and we all need acceptance.' The book at the center of the controversy, I Am Jazz, is based off of the life of now 14-year-old Jazz Jennings who, although born a boy, claims to have identified as a girl since he was two-years-old. 'From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing,' reads the book's description on Amazon.com. 'This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers.'",

Owners admit they spend hours watching the box with their animals and even leave it on when they are out to keep them company. And the nation's cats, dogs and pigs show a marked preference for programmes featuring other animals while shunning reality shows such as the Keeping Up With The Kardashians and TOWIE. Paul O'Grady's show 'For the Love of Dogs' is an absolute television favourite of pets . Almost two thirds of goldfish owners, 63 per cent, even confess to putting the tank in sight of the TV so their fish can watch it for more than three and a half hours a day. The survey of 1,000 pet owners even found the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch four hours of shows per day - or 28 hours a week. The new study by Virgin Media reveals how much our household pets love sitting in front of the box and watching their favourite TV programmes. Over a third of us, 34 per cent, say their pets watch three hours a day while left home alone - the equivalent of 42 episodes of EastEnders in a week. A quarter, 24 per cent, say their pets love watching TV so much they spend an incredible nine hours glued to it every day. Two-thirds of goldfish owners owned up to putting the bowl in sight of the TV and even the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch 28 hours of TV a week . A survey has revealed that on average, pets watch 21 hours of TV of week, whether its with their owners or by themselves . A square-eyed one per cent of dogs are glued to the TV for over 10 hours. Owners heading off to work or spending the day out feel guilty for leaving their pet alone, as 29 per cent admit they turn on the TV as they believe their animal may get lonely without them. Pets\u2019 favourite show is TV presenter Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s For The Love Of Dogs as 17 per cent of animal owners said their pet can\u2019t get enough of it. Documentary Natural World is a hit with pets as 14 per cent of owners say it\u2019s their animals\u2019 favourite show. Springwatch is pets\u2019 third favourite show with 12 per cent of votes - and soap EastEnders is surprisingly fifth with 11 per cent. However, reality show Keeping up With The Kardashians is the least favourite show as only two per cent of pets like it - and just five per cent of animals like The Only Way is Essex. 1.

According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege. A 24-year-old supermarket employee, Malian-born Lassana Bathily, was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from Coulibaly in the cold room. The hostage-taking was the culmination of three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The two brothers blamed for that attack, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed on January 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site. The terror attacks claimed the lives of 17 people and put France on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Ariana Williams reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Coming in the 86th minute of Saturday's match it was by no means his most spectacular, a mere flick from six yards out enough to take the ball past Adrian after a scuffed Jamie Vardy shot. But it was enough to defeat West Ham in a frenetic match and breathe life back into the side he has spent his whole career playing for. Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points . King is joined by David Nugent to celebrate his goal, the 50th he has scored for his club . Leicester remain at the foot of the Barclay\u2019s Premier League table, a spot they have occupied since November, and four points from safety. But King, 26, thinks the momentum they are taking into the final eight matches of the season could be enough to propel them above the drop zone. \u2018I\u2019ve scored some pretty crucial goals before, but we might look back at the end of the season and that might turn out to be the most important one yet,\u2019 said King, . \u2018It\u2019s always nice to score for the only club you\u2019ve ever played for. I\u2019ve had a brilliant journey with this club. 'I\u2019ve been on 49 for a long time, and I\u2019ve been in the Premier League for a good few months now - I was hoping it would\u2019ve come earlier but I\u2019ve ticked that milestone off now and I\u2019m delighted about that. Nigel Pearson admits Leicester survival is still a 'big ask' despite win over West Ham . Pearson congratulates goalscorer Cambiasso after the final whistle of his side's win against the Hammers . \u2018But most importantly it was about getting the three points and we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of the season to make sure we\u2019re a Premier League team next season. \u2018We\u2019ve played well enough to prove we can survive and we\u2019ve not turned it into results - this is a results business. That proves to everyone - not just ourselves - that we mean business.\u2019 Leicester manager Nigel Pearson praised King, who he brought off the bench with 12 minutes to play and said his team were finally getting the results they deserved after several games this season where they have drawn or lost despite dominating. \u2018I would love to be a lucky manager who plays crap and wins but we have not been that,\u2019 he said. King says his goal against West Ham may turn out to be his most important for the club if they stay up . \u2018It would be a pretty grumpy man who wouldn't let them enjoy winning but we have to keep our destiny in our own hands.\u2019 His opposite number Sam Allardyce denied West Ham were \u2018drifting\u2019 towards the end of the season having won just twice in the last 14 games. \u2018We\u2019re not drifting but where we\u2019re failing is we\u2019re not as clinical as we used to be. Lads in their first season have found out what physical and mental attributes are needed for a long premier league season.\u2019",

The Chicago Fire Department was called to evaluate Mr Modarkski after he was stabbed in the arm. Mr Mordarski said he would not be pressing charges following the incident. His best friend, photographer Michael Sutton, said the pen stabbing began after Lenny's arm brushed up against the woman while he slept.

'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment. 'Luckily he wore a thick long sleeve shirt or there would have been blood. He will have a few bruises in the morning. 'The passengers cheered when they heard she wasn't coming back on.' Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, South West Airlines said: 'A customer on flight 577 was removed from the flight before takeoff after poking her seatmate in the arm with a pen.

An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season. Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton . Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League. Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay. 'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said. 'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong. 'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest. 'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club. Clyne made his full England debut last November . 'We need understanding for that but nothing else. 'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. We know our level, we know our possibilities. 'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.' Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign. 'We don't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something,' he said. 'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on. 'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.' Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull. Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez. It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City. There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week. 'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them. 'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club. Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool . Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence . 'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.' Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future. Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned. But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager. 'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'",

Robert O'Neill, who claims the distinction of personally shooting dead the Al Qaeda leader, will treat specially-invited guests to a weekend shooting retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Potential attendees were contacted by the right-leaning For America non-profit and told to write back by May 10 for a chance to open fire alongside O'Neill. Shoot with The Shooter: Supporters of a conservative nonprofit were offered the change of a luxury stay in Wyoming with Robert O'Neill, pictured while still in the Navy, which would include a 'machine gun fun' contest . Citing 'security reasons', the invitation, acquired by the Washington Post, did not say exactly when the event would be - but was clear about the hefty price tag. For their substantial donation, guests will be put up in the Amangani Resort Hotel, a sprawling luxury complex perched in the Rocky Mountains, on the edge of the Grand Teton National Park. Also included is the Jackson Hole Shooting Experience, which will see clay pigeon shooting, pistol events as well as the 'machine gun fun' session. The shooting will take the form of a competition, in which guests will try to beat O'Neill's score. Lock and load: Part of the double-handed trip would see guests try out the Jackson Hole Shooting Experience, including pistols, clay pigeon shooting as fully automatic weapons. The gun range is pictured above . Lush: Guests would be housed at the\u00a0Amangani Resort Hotel, a mountain hotel complex on the edge of a national park . He has described his shooting prowess in great detail previously, specifically how he hit terrorist leader Bin Laden three times in the head, ending his life. Describing the top-secret 2011 raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, O'Neill wrote: 'He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].' In the account for Esquire magazine - written while he was still anonymous - O'Neill continued: 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap!' 'The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.' A spokesman for O\u2019Neill told the Washington Post that he was participating in the big-money event 'as a favor to a friend who has been helping him out'. On its website, ForAmerica\u00a0claims to spearhead a new conservative movement on social media. Its introductory texts says that conservatives are 'outnumbered and being hit on both flanks', which it identifies as 'the radical Left' and moderate Republicans. O'Neill leaped into the public spotlight last autumn, coming forward to identify himself as the solider previously known only as The Shooter on Veterans' Day last winter. He spoke at length to Fox News about his exploits in a two-part documentary, and has made numerous speaking engagements since. However, his public discussions of a top-secret mission have angered many in the SEALs, including top commanders who said he was breaking the organization's code of honor by seeking fame. It later emerged that he was being investigated by The Naval Criminal Investigative Service for allegedly revealing classified information. An NCIS spokesman today confirmed that the investigation is still active.",

Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said:\u00a0'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to 'cure' his homosexuality. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous.

The oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a Catholic saint was believed to be the work of a 'follower' of 16th century renaissance master El Greco. But the selling price suggests the untitled, undated and unsigned painting may actually have been done by the artist himself. Auctioneer Richard Bromell (pictured) gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 but it ended up selling for more than \u00a3120,000 . It was acquired by the owner's late father in the 1970s for very little. He bought it because he believed it was a depiction of Saint Peter, who shares his name. And it was inherited by his son, who has not been named, who kept it in his loft for the past eight years before deciding to sell it following a clear-out. Auctioneer Richard Bromell, of Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset, gave the work an estimated value of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400. But after advertising the sale, interest in the work took off. And feverish bidding, final hammer price was \u00a398,000 and came to \u00a3120,932 with all the fees added on. Mr Bromell said: 'I rung the client after the sale and just told him it sold for ninety-eight. He asked 'what pounds?' And I told him it was \u00a398,000. 'He said he needed to sit down. When he came down off the ceiling he was very, very pleased. I think if he had been offered \u00a3500 for it before the auction he would have snapped your hand off.' The oil painting (right) was believed to have been the work of a follower of\u00a016th century renaissance master El Greco (left) but the selling price suggests it may have been done by the artist himself . Mr Bromell explained it was very difficult to judge the painting. He said: 'We described it as by a follower of El Greco because that is what it looked like and I still think that to be the case. 'It was a very interesting picture and very hard to value. 'If you asked three people the question 'how much is it worth?' you would get three different answers. One reputable gallery stopped bidding at \u00a310,000 because that was how much they were prepared to pay for it.

Great fast bowler Ambrose never spoke to the media during his playing career but launched his aptly titled autobiography Time to Talk on the eve of the West Indies-England series. Ambrose was one of the West Indies stars, along with Sir Viv Richards and Richie Richardson, who accompanied Stanford when he flew by helicopter to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch his five-year deal with England that ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence, just one $20million T20 game into the contract. The England cricket team's involvement with  Allen Stanford  has been defended by  Sir Curtly Ambrose . Stanford's deal with England England ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence . Ambrose wrote: 'I wasn't surprised the England Cricket Board officials were taken in by him. We all were. His vision to improve West Indies cricket by using England seemed a hard one to argue with. But we felt that having England as the same opponents over that period would turn things stale.' Richardson said: 'He employed a lot of people in several businesses and built a stadium. He did a lot of good. We thought what he was doing was legitimate.' Richards added: 'To a lot of fellers here, he did well.' Ambrose accompanied Stanford when he flew to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch the deal . The new ECB president Giles Clarke\u00a0did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy saying it was a long time ago . However, the new ECB president Giles Clarke, who negotiated the doomed deal and greeted Stanford on his arrival at Lord's with a bear hug, did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy. Before the Wisden launch last week at which he made a fool of himself by haranguing both the guest speaker and Wisden editor Lawrence Booth, Clarke would only say of Stanford: 'That was all a long time ago.' Perhaps it's no surprise, with Stanford's decaying cricket stadium just outside Antigua's airport there for all visitors to see, that Clarke is swerving today's first Test on the island. Michael Vaughan might still be a long way from agreeing terms and working patterns to become England's director of cricket. But he is staying at England's luxury Sugar Ridge Hotel in Antigua, so he's right in the middle of any politics going on over the appointment of a director and ideally placed to judge the mood music of players and management. Director of cricket hopeful Michael Vaughan is staying at England's luxury Sugar Ridge Hotel in Antigua . England\u00a0rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster seems unperturbed by criticism that after four successive second places in the Six Nations, he's been talking the talk, rather than walking the walk. Lancaster has a speaking engagement a week today in aid of the Dallaglio Foundation along with Sir Clive Woodward, Lawrence Dallaglio and captain Chris Robshaw at a \u00a3225-a-head function. The RFU say all Lancaster's talks in the run-up to the World Cup are for charity. Stuart Lancaster seems unperturbed by criticism that\u00a0he's been talking the talk, not walking the walk . The Grand National peak viewing figure of 8.8million proved that this is one event on the racing calendar that Channel 4 invariably get right, even without Clare Balding. And the occasion was a personal triumph for regular racing presenter Nick Luck, who proved that C4 didn't need a Jeremy Kyle or Jake Humphrey when Balding defected to commentate on the men's and women's Boat Races for the BBC.

Jimmy Anderson\u00a0being interviewed by cricket journalists on the eve of his 100th Test when he is just four wickets from becoming England's record Test bowler, was asked what advice he would give young bowlers starting their international careers. Anderson replied 'Ignore the media', which even if meant 'tongue in cheek', as he later claimed, was a pretty crass thing to say as someone who has benefited hugely over the years from money for newspaper columns. Meanwhile, captain Alastair Cook said he had learned of Kevin Pietersen's century yesterday from Test Match Special's Jonathan Agnew while being interviewed. Surely the ECB should have briefed him about KP's exploits \u2014 the elephant in the room \u2014 before his media duties.

The xylella fastidiosa bacteria has ravaged olive trees in the Puglia region and contributed to a 35 percent drop in the region's olive oil production last year. Its spread has so alarmed the EU that France announced a boycott of Puglian fruit and vegetables, while its effect on production will mean shortages in the supply of olive oil and is likely to lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world. An Italian forestry official stands guard as workers begin chopping down an infected olive oil tree . Police officers were also on hand to maintain order after protesters attempted to stop the trees' destruction . A forestry official walks past the fenced-off remains of an olive oil tree destroyed in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease . A forestry worker cuts through the stump of a tree infected with the deadly xylella fastidiosa bacteria . Puglian growers have opposed the government's destruction plan, saying it won't stop the bacteria's spread . However, Puglian growers have opposed the government's slash-and-burn plan, saying it won't contain the bacteria's spread. Several dozen protesters tried unsuccessfully yesterday to block the first seven trees from being felled in Oria, near Brindisi, even climbing the branches and shouting 'assassins.' Eventually, the first seven trees were cut down and are to be burned today, with more to follow. Many of Italy's oldest olive groves, some dating back 500 years, have been infected by the bacterium, which causes plants to shrivel, leaving them incapable of bearing fruit. Puglia, a region in the heel of Italy, produces about 11million tons of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop, and they are used to make some of the country's best oils. The initial area to be culled is 20,000 acres \u2013 about 30 sq miles \u2013 between Lecce to Brindisi. It contains around 11million trees, according to Unaprol, the largest consortium of growers. It is feared that unless drastic action is taken to fell the groves, the bacterium will spread to other olive-producing regions of Italy such as Tuscany and Umbria, and even to other Mediterranean countries. Last month Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Food Safety and Security, said he was 'profoundly concerned by the gravity of the situation'. He added: 'We have to take decisive measures with immediate effect. Naturally it is very painful for the growers but it is necessary to remove all the affected trees, it is the most effective measure.' The bacteria (right) causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit. Pictured left are protesters sitting in the branches of an olive oil tree earmarked for destruction . The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy . Below is a summary of the Italian virgin olive oil market worldwide, according to Unaprol (organisation of Italian oil producers), showing the main importing countries: . USA:\u00a0Italy holds a market share of 51 per cent, with exports up 2 per cent in 2013. AUSTRIA:\u00a0Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 48 per cent share.

Romantic Ben Parsons, 34, of Brighton, East Sussex, stunned girlfriend Anna Jefferson, 36, by getting down on one knee after running 24 and a half miles. She was watching her boyfriend run in the Brighton marathon with their children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months. Ben Parson, 34, paused in the middle of the Brighton marathon and proposed to his surprised girlfriend, Anna Jefferson, 36 . Anna feared her boyfriend was struggling when he started to slow down on Hove seafront, because she was unaware of his proposal plan. Ben then got down on one knee and popped the question and Anna said yes, before Ben ran onward towards the finishing line, still managing to get a personal best timing and completing his sixth Brighton Marathon in 3hrs 36min. Ben, a media law lecturer at the University of Brighton, carried the ring in his bum bag and waited to spot Anna in the crowd on Sunday. He said: 'I wanted to do something romantic to surprise Anna and the marathon has such a feelgood, loved-up atmosphere anyway so I knew it would be the perfect time. Ben Parson had already run 24.5 miles of the 26.2-mile Brighton marathon when he stopped to propose to girlfriend and mother of his two children, Anna Parsons . At the time, Anna had been stood in the crowds with children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months . 'Judging by the look on her face, she was certainly surprised. 'Once Anna had said 'yes' and we'd had a big sweaty hug I had to get on the move again so my legs wouldn't seize up. 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com. 'I had an extra spring in my step for the last mile and a half.' 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com': After Anna said yes, Ben carried on with the marathon . He said that the pressure of the proposal spurred him on and brought the finishing line a bit closer. But he joked: 'If I hadn't seen her in the crowd maybe I would have just carried on to the end and taken the ring back to Argos.' Anna, who works for Arts Council England, and has been dating Ben since they met at City College Brighton in 2002, said she never expected the proposal. She said: 'There had been a guy just before him who had got a cramp and had to stop for his friends to massage his leg. Newly-engaged: The happy couple are stood after the surprise proposal with their two children . 'Then Ben started slowing down and I thought 'oh god he's going to collapse or something'. 'I had no idea what he was planning. 'In hindsight he had suggested before that I wear something nice so we could go out for something to eat afterwards.

The Spaniard has come in for criticism for persisting with trying to get his side to play out from the back despite results suffering recently. There were even suggestions the players had gone to him asking to play a more direct style but Martinez has always stuck rigidly to his principles, which was the case when he was at Wigan when they were in relegation battles every season.

Everton striker Arouna Kone (right) is tackled by Southampton defender Jose Fonte (left) at Goodison Park . Everton left-back Leighton Baines comes in with a strong challenge on Southampton forward Shane Long . But while he may persist in wanting to play the same way he said that does not mean his tactics are rigid. 'The people who say that I am tactically not flexible are people who do not follow my work,' Martinez told the Liverpool Echo. 'I have been innovative at every football club I have been at with my tactics, my shape and my approach. 'I am not someone who needs to defend myself but if you follow my work then I am probably one of the most flexible managers tactically that you could work with.' Martinez tinkered with the shape of his side in Saturday's victory over Southampton, their third successive league win, as he switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation with Gareth Barry the solitary holding midfielder with his regular central partner James McCarthy pushed further forward. He explained he made the change to compensate for the absence of leading scorer Romelu Lukaku, who is still recovering from a hamstring injury. 'It was because we didn't have Romelu,' he added. 'In certain games we played with two strikers. On Saturday we had Aaron Lennon really high up the pitch and James McCarthy had freedom. 'Every game is different. Southampton have a very strong back six that needs to be broken in different ways. 'We don't play the same way twice, but it is not for me to go openly and publicly and tell everyone what we have done.' Martinez insists that his tactics are 'innovative' and points to his changes made against Southampton . Having started the season poorly, Everton are now up to 11th in the Premier League table with 37 points .",

The 50-year-old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with Mike Ashley\u2019s running of the club. Results on the pitch \u2013 they have lost five on the spin - have not helped Carver\u2019s cause, but the problems at Newcastle run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad. John Carver says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of Newcastle United . United\u2019s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire Ashley, especially as the Magpies have returned record profits of \u00a318.7million and this week revealed they also have \u00a334m sat in a bank account. Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer \u2013 or deflect \u2013 questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James\u2019 Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship. On Tyneside, however, he will inherit what Carver believes is the toughest task in the land: \u2018I think it is the hardest job in football, definitely,\u2019 he said. Steve McClaren has already been tipped as a replacement for Carver should he face the Newcastle axe . \u2018For me, this is the dream job, but you love it and hate it at the same time. \u2018The hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people. Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. \u2018Sometimes you\u2019re dealt the hand and you\u2019ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I\u2019ve been dealt. \u2018When I took it on, if I hadn\u2019t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. \u2018And I\u2019ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I\u2019ve got the right tools I can do the job. \u2018But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.\u2019 Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . \u2018I would go to the match because I support the team,\u2019 said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. \u2018I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. \u2018I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. \u2018So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.\u2019 Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .",

In spite of the defeat which prompted her predecessor's resignation, the SNP leader has racked up support across Scotland since, with some fans even hopeful of a victory on May 7. But weeks after having to deny allegations of back-room plotting against Ed Miliband, Mrs Sturgeon has been rocked by more smearing claims yet. For with just two weeks to go until she canvasses polling station queues, the 44-year-old has been accused of savage violence. The SNP leader (pictured right, aged 14) has denied her sister's claims she used to shave the heads off her sister's Barbie dolls . According to her sister, Gillian Owens, the politician was prone to hacking the hair of from dolls as a child. 'She once cut the hair off my Sindy doll, just for fun,' Gillian Owens, a part-time actress, said. Rebutting the claims, the politician told the BBC: 'I deny the allegations levelled at me by my sister. 'I'm sure I didn't cut the hair off her Barbie doll. 'But if I did it - and it's an \"if\" - then there would have been provocation involved, I'm sure of it.' Later posting on Twitter, she added: 'For the record I think my sister is misremembering. I'm sure it was a Sindy doll. #dollgate.' Poking fun at the tale, she told one follower: 'I'm not proud of it... but I've changed. My niece's have never come to any harm.' The accusations sparked a Twitter trend with internet users sharing mocking photographs of beheaded Barbie dolls on Saturday afternoon. The politician poked fun at her sister's claims which sparked a Twitter trend on Saturday afternoon . Twitter users were quick to join in on the joke, sharing photographs of beheaded dolls on the social network . One user shared this photograph of the SNP leader as a murderous doll herself, holding a pair of scissors . A joke Twitter account was set up in the name Barbie Sturgeon in the wake of the claims this weekend . In an interview with The Sun, Mrs Sturgeon's sister told of how they were 'like chalk and cheese' growing up. 'I was into dolls and everything girly. Nicola was into sitting reading. She was a very strong-minded wee girl.' Polls suggest the SNP is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern British politics, winning as many as 50 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Commons seats. That would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at Westminster for the first time. Mrs Sturgeon did not attend a ceremony at the Cenotaph this morning with other party leaders to commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli Landings. Laying a wreath a Scottish memorial site instead she later attended an SNP women's rally in Glasgow City Centre. The SNP leader skipped the Cenotaph ceremony to join female voters in central Glasgow at a women's rally .",

The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for\u00a0Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game,\u00a0USA Today\u00a0reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday.

Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released but\u00a0Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.",

The authorities say the temple has been keeping the animals without the proper paperwork and have vowed to seize them, sparking standoffs in recent weeks between officials and angry monks blocking their way. Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) said earlier this week it planned to take the animals away on Friday. But when officials arrived at the temple Friday morning they contented themselves with counting the tigers, most of whom are microchipped, to ascertain how many there are in the sanctuary.

'We have come to check and scan the tigers to see whether the numbers match what we have or not,' DNP official Somsak Poopet told AFP, adding his department said they had been told there should be 147 tigers at the temple. Asked whether the department would consider seizing the animals he replied: 'We have that idea but in our actions so far it has not reached that process yet.' Unlike previous visits, the monks did not object to officials entering the sanctuary, an AFP photographer on the scene said. The tigers were led out in groups of four and tied to a tree to allow officials to scan their microchips. Of the said 147 tigers, less than half were brought out to have their chips read .

Local animal rights groups have accused the temple of failing to properly look after the tigers. In February, wildlife officials said they conducted a raid and discovered dozens of hornbills, jackals and Asian bears that were being kept at the sanctuary without the correct permits. 'I think a lot of the people here are very motivated, I think they really love the animals, but they're doing it absolutely the wrong way,' Edwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, which has campaigned to have the tigers removed, told AFP. 'Wildlife management, whether that's in the wild or captivity, comes with a lot of knowledge, a lot of rules, a lot of dos and don'ts. And walking around with adult tigers like this, that could snap their mood at any time, is an accident waiting to happen,' he added. Temple authorities were unavailable for comment Friday. But they insist they are a genuine conservation project and have previously denied allegations that they have failed to look after the animals or illegally traffic in them.

It\u2019s another defeat and that\u2019s not good enough. This is the most difficult situation I\u2019ve ever been in but I\u2019m not going to give up on it.\u2019 Although the official attendance was returned as a massively inaccurate 47, 427 \u2013 making it the biggest of the weekend in the top-flight \u2013 estimates had it nearer 40,000 as fans stayed away in protest at Mike Ashley\u2019s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of \u00a318.7million before revealing they have a further \u00a334m in the bank. The billionaire will need to part with a sizeable chunk of that cash this summer if Newcastle are to avoid a season-long struggle against relegation next time around.

Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher, meanwhile, launched a scathing attack on Ashley. \u2018People will say as supporters you\u2019ve got to come back, you\u2019ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters?\u2019 he said. \u2018Since Mike Ashley\u2019s been here they\u2019ve been relegated once and they could be relegated again. \u2018So he\u2019s balanced the books and he\u2019s made money because he\u2019s a businessman, but I think of these people and wonder, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be excited yourself?\u201d. \u2018I\u2019m getting bored by Newcastle. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there\u2019s nothing happening? There\u2019s no cup run, I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why he wants to own a football club.\u2019 The defeat leaves Newcastle seven points above the drop zone and Carver has previously confessed that he does not know where their next point is coming from. Tottenham striker Harry Kane at full stretch with of Spurs is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . After Kane was chosen as caretaker of the captain's armband, Jan Vertonghen returned to lead Tottenham at St James' Park . Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Newcastle's Vernon Anita . On this evidence, they may well have to rely on their current tally of 35 being enough. They were hardly helped here by Tim Krul. But perhaps the loss of form of the usually-dependable goalkeeper best represents the problems which have plagued the squad in recent weeks. The Dutch stopper could have done more to keep out Chadli\u2019s first-half opener and was again culpable as Eriksen struck to restore the lead after Jack Colback had levelled early in the second half. Chadli appeared to have exhausted his options as he floated in possession 25 yards from goal only to drop his shoulder before slamming into the bottom corner with Krul sluggish in his pursuit of the strike. Carver reacted to an insipid first half by hooking the ineffective Yoan Gouffran and midfielder Mehdi Abeid and within 20 seconds they were level when Colback steamed onto a loose ball inside the area before slotting home. Chadli was given space outside the box and pulled the trigger just as Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback arrived in defence . Colback is too late as the Belgian laces his shot from range and it nestles in the bottom corner giving Newcastle keeper Tim Krul no chance .

Chadli leaps in the air with delight after his sublime strike for the opening goal of the match . Christian Eriksen (left) tussles with Newcastle's Ryan Taylor at St James' Park on Sunday . But parity was to last just eight minutes and Eriksen\u2019s free-kick \u2013 intended as a cross \u2013 bounced through the weak grasp of Krul and into the back of the net. Krul, in fairness, made a string of fine stops to keep Newcastle within one but he was powerless to prevent Kane rolling beyond him in stoppage-time after he had skipped onto Erik Lamela\u2019s through-ball. In doing so Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to score 30 goals in one season. And the England striker now has Lineker\u2019s total of 35 in his sights. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise for Newcastle . Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at Newcastle's home St James' Park . Fans applaud while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, No Ashley' sign, while Colback's Newcastle team-mates join in the celebrations . \u2018I'm very proud but there are five games left and, hopefully, I'll get a few more goals,\u2019 he said. Manager Mauricio Pochettino added: \u2018We were better than Newcastle and deserved the win. \u2018For Harry, it is a fantastic achievement. We need to push him now because he has a lot of improvement left in him.\u2019 Newcastle, meanwhile, will also need to improve in the final five matches of their sorry season, or risk starting next in the second tier.

The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside\u00a0Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate\u00a0as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nEngland's dressing-room brains trust will take on an extra dimension if Zafar Ansari, the Surrey spin-bowling all-rounder, makes his international debut against Ireland in Malahide on May 8. The 23-year-old Ansari, who celebrated his call-up with four Essex wickets at The Kia Oval, graduated from Cambridge two years ago with a double first in politics and sociology. He is halfway through a 40,000-word masters on the 1960s civil rights movement in the American south, and plays the piano to a high level. It's fair to say he would be England's most academically gifted cricketer since Ed Smith \u2013 another Cambridge double first \u2013 won three Test caps in 2003. Surrey's Zafar Ansarihas been called up to England's ODI squad for the clash against Ireland . The left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner also has an eye on a career in academia one day . 'I think my Surrey team-mates enjoy having someone to talk to about things they don't think about or talk about necessarily,' Ansari told Sportsmail. 'I try to use the studies to avoid taking cricket too seriously. I think cricket is a sport, and isn't that important in the grand scheme of things. My studies and cricket are tools for each other, and I do try to see them in those instrumental ways.' Ansari, part of a young England squad picked with the 2019 World Cup in mind, opens in four-day cricket for his county, but bats in the middle order in limited-overs matches, bowls accurate left-arm spin and is an athletic fielder. England almost chose him for the Test tour of the Caribbean. James Taylor will captain England against Ireland . 'Playing in Dublin would be nerve-wracking because of the exposure,' he said. 'But when it comes to one-day cricket, I feel the gap between international and county cricket maybe isn't as big as between Test cricket and the second division.' Ansari's rise was accelerated by his five-wicket haul for Cambridge MCCU against Surrey back in 2011, when he removed Kevin Pietersen for 30 and helped the students to a 10-wicket win. Pietersen, now a county team-mate, was going through a difficult patch against left-arm spinners, but Ansari insists the pair have not spoken about the dismissal. 'It's never come up,' he said. 'I don't know if it was a touchy issue for him at the time, but it was a touchy issue in general. Anyone could have got him out \u2013 it just happened to be me.' Ansari spent three weeks in Sri Lanka over the winter with England Performance Programme, where he talked about the art of left-handed batting with Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance, and life as a spin bowler with Stephen Parry, Adil Rashid and Adam Riley. He is juggling his time between playing for Surrey and writing up his dissertation at London's Royal Holloway. He doesn't rule out a PhD or a career in academia. If so, he would follow the path of his father, Khizar, who hails from Lahore in Pakistan, settled in England in his teens because his own father was an engineer in the British Army, and was awarded an OBE 13 years ago for his work on race relations. Zafar's English mother is a historian. Between now and May 8, the dissertation may have to wait its turn. 'I'd love to give it a go with England,' he said. 'Things can happen quickly. A couple of good performances and it starts to snowball.' Lewis Gregory . A promising seam bowler who can bat a bit, the 22-year-old Gregory emerged through the ranks of Devon cricket before joining Somerset. Took 43 Championship wickets last season at an average of 26. Has also captained England Under 19s. David Willey . Northamptonshire's seam-bowling all-rounder was man of the match in the final of the 2013 domestic Twenty20 tournament. Son of former England all-rounder Peter, he celebrated his call-up with a typically hard-hitting fifty against Leicestershire. He's a left-armer too, which is all the rage after the World Cup. His county captain Alex Wakely reckons he's 'the Northants Botham'. Sam Billings . An explosive keeper-batsman at Kent, the 23-year-old Billings thrashed 458 runs in last season's Royal London One-Day Cup at an average of 114 and a strike-rate of 154. Made England's provisional 30-man World Cup squad when Craig Kieswetter withdrew because of an eye injury.",

Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was meant to ink 'Riley' - the name of his four-year-old son - into his left arm. But instead of the letter 'L', Mr Moffatt started needling the letter P - and had to urgently 'scribble' over the mistake. What was he thi-ink-ing? Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside, Greater Manchester, inked his son Riley's name into his arm - but accidentally spelled it incorrectly . Error: Instead of 'L', Mr Moffatt started needling 'P' and had to quickly scribble over it (left).\u00a0He also attempted to mark himself with Riley's nickname 'Sonny Boy' - but ended up scratching 'Sony Boy' instead (right) He also attempted to mark himself with Riley's nickname 'Sonny Boy' - but ended up scratching 'Sony Boy' across his knuckles instead. The makeshift tattoo session took place in Mr Moffatt's living room with a \u00a370 ink gun bought online. The NHS worker was drunk at the time and said he now considers the inkwork a 'nightmare'. He said: 'I'd never picked up a tattoo gun in my life and I got told by my brother not to do, but I just didn't listen. 'Now, my family are always saying \"you're an idiot, Tom\" and there are plenty of jokes at my expense from my mates. I can't repeat what they say about it. 'I have to hide my arm when I go for interviews. Even Riley has started to notice and points at those tattoos and says \"daddy, I don't like those ones\". It's a nightmare.' Among his homegrown tattoos, Mr Moffatt also has a wonky cross on his forearm, which he drew just a few months after Riley's birth in 2012. He has just endured his second hour-long laser removal session in a bid to get rid of the botched needlework. Botched: The makeshift tattoo session took place in Mr Moffatt's living room with a \u00a370 ink gun bought online. The NHS worker was drunk at the time and said he now thought of the inkwork as a 'nightmare' Nightmare: The NHS worker has just endured his second hour-long laser removal session in a bid to get rid of the botched needlework .

Painful: But because the ink has gone so deep, Mr Moffatt is unsure how many more sessions he needs to have . He said: 'I've got a long journey ahead of me to get them all off and I pressed it so deep in one that it's going to be very difficult to get it off.' Mr Moffatt, who also has a two-year-old daughter Kya with partner Rachael Higgins, 23, now wants to use his experience to highlight why people should not attempt to draw their own tattoos. He said: 'Once I've got them off, my job isn't done. We want to try and get a campaign going so people like me can't just go out and buy a gun with no questions asked. 'You shouldn't be able to go on the internet as a 15-year-old Joe Bloggs and buy one. I want to get the message out there that tattoos should only be done by professionals.' The owner of the Maria Patricia Tattoo Removals, where he is being treated, says Mr Moffatt's situation is a stark warning against the dangers of unregulated ink work. Maria said: 'There needs to be more regulation. People don't realise the dangers of the buying off tattoo guns and ink off the internet. 'Tom did just that and had to Google the instructions of how to use it. It might seem like a laugh with mates when you're drunk but it's not easy to fix the damage and people can be left with scarring if they're not careful. 'We're all for tattoos but people need to be aware they can wreck lives and make it difficult to get jobs.' Mr Moffatt, a machine operator working on NHS hospital equipment,\u00a0will appear in Tattoo Disasters UK, which airs each Tuesday, new and exclusive to Spike.",

No, we don't have to call them thugs.\" \"Just call them n-----s.  Just call them n-----s,\" he said.  \"No, we don't have to call them by names such as that.\" The Rev. Jamal Bryant drew the same comparison Wednesday morning on CNN.  The President and the mayor are wrong, he said.  \"These are not thugs, these are upset and frustrated children.\" \"It's amazing.  You don't call six police officers who kill a man without probable cause 'thugs,' but children who are frustrated and don't have an outlet, you call them 'thugs.'  'Thugs' is the 21st century word for the n-word.  And it is repulsive and it is offensive to every person who is a parent trying to raise children interpreting what's taking place in this hour.\" The recent unrest in Baltimore was sparked by the arrest and death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in custody.  Six officers have been suspended over the incident.  Bryant delivered the eulogy at Gray's funeral. What we know, don't know about Freddie Gray's death . Mayor Rawlings-Blake responded Wednesday. \"I wanted to clarify my comments on 'thugs,'\" she wrote Wednesday on Twitter.  \"When you speak out of frustration and anger, one can say things in a way that you don't mean.\" She added, \"That night we saw misguided young people who need to be held accountable, but who also need support. And my comments then didn't convey that.\" Kweisi Mfume, Baltimore native and former president of the NAACP, said, \"It's important we not shift the focus into something that has absolutely nothing to do with poverty, despair, hunger, homelessness and a sense of not belonging.\" \"Whether we call them a thug, a law breaker, a juvenile delinquent, it really doesn't matter. What matters is how do we take back our streets. And that's what men have been doing, going around, talking to these young men where they, are in their face, and letting them know, you can't control this community. It is not yours. You can't burn it down. You can't force people out. You can't threaten people,\"  he told \"OutFront.\" \"So I understand that, that people want to talk about a word. But I'm more worried about a movement, and it's not necessarily a movement for positive change. It's a movement for negative change right now unless we get it under control.\" Kevin Shird, another Baltimore native and author of \"Lessons of Redemption,\" said \"thug\" is \"not like the n-word in my mind.\"  But, he said in a CNN interview, the term has \"been racialized across America, so I can see why people would become offended like that.\" Shird, a former drug dealer, also said he does not see the word as an accurate description of the young people who rioted and looted in Baltimore on Monday.  \"These were young juveniles. And so, in my mind I don't see a 16- or 17-year-old as a thug. I have seen thugs, and they don't look like thugs to me. My experience in life has been a little bit more extreme than that, but, again, it was criminal behavior and it can't be justified.\" He added, \"We just want to stay focused on the issue of police brutality and of the Freddie Gray matter.\" Opinion: Calling people 'thugs' solves nothing . NFL player Richard Sherman has previously called the term \"the accepted way of calling somebody the n-word nowadays.\" Rapper Slim Thug once addressed the term on the Houston radio program \"Madd Hatta Morning Show.\"  The host set up the exchange by referring to deceased rapper Tupac Shakur. \"I got the Tupac definition,\" the host said, as \"OutFront\" reported online in January 2014.  \"His is just, you know, a person going through struggles, has gone through struggles and continue to live day-by-day.... just trying to make it. \" \"I think the same thing,\" Slim Thug responded.  \"I probably got 'thug' off of him, you know, growing up listening to him... I feel the same way that he felt, coming from nothing to something.\" Webster's Dictionary defines \"thug\" as \"a brutal ruffian or assassin.\" On Monday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said, \"There is a difference between what we saw over the past week with the peaceful protests, those who wish to seek justice, those who wish to be heard, and want answers, and the difference between those protests and the thugs who only want to incite violence and destroy our city.\" On Tuesday, President Obama referred to the rioters as \"a handful of criminals and thugs who tore up the place.\" That same day, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry used the word \"thugs\" to refer to ISIS.  At a luncheon in honor of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Kerry referred to two Japanese citizens \"who were murdered by the thugs of Daesh in retribution for Japan's pledge of humanitarian assistance -- I repeat, humanitarian assistance -- to the victims of fighting in the Middle East.\"  (Daesh is another term for ISIS.) Kerry has also referred to \"thugs\" in the Ukraine crisis. Obama has also used the term \"thugs\" in similar context.  \"Not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States,\" he said in one speech.

Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a \"dead mall\" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. \"It's been a big change. It's a clear modernization,\" said David Carr, an English teacher from the United States who is living in Dongguan with his wife Danae, also a teacher. \"We come here at least once a month now.\" Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. But most of the unoccupied units, along with halls and walkways are under renovation. Even on a Saturday, it's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack-hammering and sawing. Ms Shu, head of New South China Mall's marketing unit, told CNN that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring, when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants. \"All construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in May,\" she said, declining to give her full name. \"We expect that from May, we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops.\" She said she couldn't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media. Ms Ye, head of investments, confirmed that \"business is really great,\" but would not comment further. Dutch retail chain Spar, which has expanded its supermarket to two floors, explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall's \"upgrading and retrofitting program.\" There are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall. When I spoke to her, Huang Haiyan, a young Chinese woman, was just two days away from opening a little caf\u00e9 called \"Miss & H\" in one of the passage ways being renovated. Sitting on the sidewalk outside the caf\u00e9, she and her partners were busy washing up cups, classes and plates ahead of the big day. \"I'm so excited!\" she said, showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when I last visited the mall two years ago. \"You must come, my coffee is the best in China!\" The area around the previously run-down Arc de Triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes. In January, a globe shaped IMAX-style cinema was launched at the outdoor square. One of the more eye-catching new sources of entertainment is a role-playing amusement center for children called Myrules World. Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. It's hard to believe how rapid the change has been. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. \"Many large malls (and residential construction) in China.... are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class,\" he said. \"What is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to (the much larger) bulk of middle-class Chinese.\" And, he says, other developments that were once labeled \"ghost cities\" have gone on to thrive. \"One to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments, so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional,\"Jackson said. Despite its retrofitting program, the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly. Most of Dongguan's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. The town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in China or to Southeast Asia where wages are lower. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. In March, prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. In 2007, the mall changed name from \"South China Mall\" to \"New South China Mall, Living City\" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city .",

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport. Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. Passengers snapped photos of the damaged winglet after two Ryanair planes collided at Dublin Airport . Passengers escaped injury after two Ryanair planes clipped wings while taxiing to a runway at Dublin Airport . Passenger Shannen Murphy, who was seated on the Edinburgh-bound plane which lost part of its winglet, told MailOnline Travel: \u2018We were just about to approach the runway and there was another Ryanair plane quite close, but I thought maybe it had broken down or something. \u2018And then next of all there was a jerk in the plane, which felt like we had gone over a really big pothole.\u2019 Moments later the pilot announced over the tannoy that there had been \u2018an incident\u2019 with another plane and passengers would have to return to the terminal. Shannen said passengers were stuck on the plane for up to 90 minutes, as they waited for buses to arrive, and they arrived in Edinburgh about three hours behind schedule. \u2018As soon as we were off [the bus] we were taken straight to a new plane and within 30 minutes we were up in the air.\u2019 One of the Ryanair planes' winglets was left dangling after the collision on a taxiway at Dublin Airport . Emergency services attended the scene of the collision as a precaution. Passengers on board both planes were taken back to the terminal by bus and put on replacement aircraft to continue their journeys to Scotland and Croatia. The Boeing 737s involved in the collision were taken out of service to undergo inspections and any necessary repairs. The collision caused delays for other flights, with one passenger tweeting: '2 jets hit at Dublin, my flight to Malaga delayed'. Dublin Airport said in a tweet: \u2018No injuries on the two aircraft which clipped each other on a taxiway this am. Passengers in process of being taken off the aircraft.\u2019 A passenger snapped this photo of the Boeing 737s after they collided while taxiing to a runway . Emergency services attended the scene of the collision as a precaution, but were not needed . Dublin Airport sent a series of tweet urging passengers to check their flight status . Referring to a similar incident that occurred in October, one passenger wrote on Twitter: \u2018Ryanair have done it again, two aircraft have collided while taxiing to the runway #ryanair #facepalm\u2019. A Ryanair spokesperson said the collision occurred as two planes \u2018were taxiing slowly\u2019 to the runway. The spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: \u2018The winglet of one aircraft appears to have scraped the tail fin of the other. A Ryanair spokesperson said the collision occurred as two planes \u2018were taxiing slowly\u2019 to the runway . The Boeing 737 that was preparing to take off for Edinburgh remained on the taxiway for more than an hour . Passengers disembarked and returned to the terminal by bus after the planes collided . \u2018Both aircraft were under the instruction of Dublin Airport Air Traffic Control at the time. \u2018Customers have been bussed back to the terminal and will board replacement aircraft to continue their journeys to Edinburgh and Zadar. In October a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. Passengers\u2019 photos of the aftermath showed the winglet lodged in the rear wing of the plane it crashed into. Last year in June, two Ryanair planes clipped wings \u2013 ripping the tip off of one of them \u2013 at London Stansted Airport. Customers faces delays of up to three hours after the planes, one bound for Warsaw and one which had just arrived from Frankfurt, collided.

A 26-year-old man wanted for the\u00a0murder of his mother and sister has been arrested\u00a0after being spotted by a member of the public. Peter Fox, from Liverpool, was arrested at Euston Station in London\u00a0this morning on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette, 57, and Sarah Fox, 27, following a nationwide manhunt. Detectives released CCTV images of the 26-year-old  leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm on Wednesday and arriving at Euston railway station in the capital at 10.57pm. The body of his sister  was found by police on Thursday night, just hours before her 57-year-old mother Bernadette was found dead at sheltered accommodation just half a mile away in Bootle, Merseyside. Merseyside Police said Mrs Fox died of asphyxiation, while her daughter was repeatedly stabbed. Bernadette and Sarah's family today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Rooney from Merseyside Police said: 'I can confirm that a 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette and Sarah Fox this morning and is being brought back to Merseyside. 'A significant amount of work has been carried out over the weekend with the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police and I would like to thank them for their assistance. 'I would also like to thank the media and the public for their support during the weekend, which has helped us enormously.' In a statement issued through police, a spokesman for the Fox family said: 'We are absolutely devastated following the loss of Bernadette and Sarah and are still trying to come to terms with what has happened to them both. The family of Bernadette (left) and Sarah (right) have said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss . 'Bernadette, who was a mother of three and grandmother of three, was a very outgoing and lovely person who wouldn't harm anyone. In fact she only ever had nice things to say about people. She was so caring and would help anyone. 'And Sarah was loved by her family and well-liked by her friends and neighbours. She was a fantastic aunty and was a cheeky, bubbly and outgoing person who loved her dog. They will both be greatly missed. 'We would ask that people appreciate that this is a sad and tragic time for the family and that we are left alone to grieve in peace, whilst we try to understand what has happened.' The family urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police to help them 'find justice for Bernadette and Sarah'. Sarah Fox's body was found around 9pm on Thursday night after police received a phone call about her welfare. A neighbour had reportedly raised the alarm after seeing a dog loose on the streets. Detectives released CCTV images of Peter Fox arriving at Euston Station (right) in the capital at around 10.57pm on Wednesday night after leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm (left) Another neighbour living close to the flat, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw one of my neighbours in the street who said he was worried after he noticed the dog from the flat roaming the streets, he had seen it a few times so he knocked on the door but got no answer. 'He called to the house last night and noticed there was a downstairs window open and the back door was ajar.' It was then that the police were called and officers found Sarah Fox's body, who they said had suffered 'multiple injuries'. 'It's so shocking. I've spoken to the girl from those flats before two or three times, she seemed a nice girl,' the neighbour added. Bernadette Fox was found when police arrived at her address through other enquiries. One neighbour near the sheltered housing property, who did wish to be named, said: 'The girl's name was Sarah - people called her Foxy - and her mum was Bernie. Police launched a double murder inquiry after the bodies of two women were found at separate addresses in Bootle, Merseyside. Pictured, officers outside a property in Worcester Road . Sarah Fox, 27, was found dead with multiple injuries at around 9pm on Thursday evening, after police were called to Worcester Road (pictured) over concerns for her welfare . 'Bernie was harmless and Sarah I think had worked at a solicitors nearby, Bernie had a son as well. 'The place where Bernie lived was sheltered accommodation and it had cameras all over the place. 'There's a camera over the intercom so anyone letting someone in would see them. It's a hard place to get into.' Martin Stevenson, Director of Older People's Services at Your Housing Group, said yesterday: 'Tragically a body was discovered at one of our Roger Arden Court sheltered scheme apartments in Bootle this morning. 'Merseyside Police attended the incident and we are continuing to support them with their investigations. 'Our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the deceased at this difficult time.' Patricia Doragh, who lives in a property near the flat, said: 'It is quite a rough area around here especially up the side streets. 'The police are always up and down the main road it's not a rare thing, it's a street quite well known for alcohol. 'When I took my grandsons out earlier about 12 o'clock there was nothing here and now all the cordons are up.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nFirst impressions are not necessarily the best. When Adam Lyth scratched around for 22 in a Championship match against Nottinghamshire in 2008, Graeme Swann branded him a \u2018walking wicket\u2019. \u2018But then,\u2019 Swann added. \u2018He proved us all wrong.\u2019 Lyth, one of six Yorkshire players in the England squad that left Heathrow on Thursday for three Tests in the Caribbean, hit back in that match seven years ago with a second-innings of 132. Wisden later called him \u2018the find of the season\u2019. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth fields during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . Now he finds himself competing with Jonathan Trott to be Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner at the first Test in Antigua on April 13. It has been quite a rise. \u2018I was over the moon when I was told about my selection,\u2019 he told Sportsmail. \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get going.\u2019 The story of Lyth\u2019s ascent, from a talented but inconsistent left-hander to the ballast behind Yorkshire\u2019s charge to the Championship last season is one of grit, nous and no little skill. He finished with 1,489 runs \u2014 more than anyone in the country \u2014 six hundreds and a welter of awards. In fact, much of the hard work had been done before the season began, prompted by a moderate 2013 which forced him to work on his concentration levels. Yorkshire\u2019s sports psychologist Scott Hartley came up with the idea of harnessing Lyth\u2019s love of golf \u2014 his handicap is eight \u2014 to get him holing one short putt after another. The challenge lay not in the task itself, but in its repetition. \u2018There\u2019s no skill in sinking a two-foot putt,\u2019 said Lyth. \u2018It\u2019s just about concentration. It\u2019s a bit like batting and not giving your wicket away. You try not to do something silly.\u2019 After 213 successful putts, he missed. But the point had been made. Lyth set about 2014 with renewed focus. \u2018It wasn\u2019t just the concentration side of the game \u2014 my confidence changed, too,\u2019 he said. \u2018I got runs early on against the university sides, then played well at Taunton. It just snowballed from there.\u2019 Lyth plays a shot while batting for Yorkshire against the MCC at the\u00a0Sheik Zayed Stadium last month . At a time when England\u2019s Test batsmen have lost the knack of scoring the \u2018daddy hundreds\u2019 once espoused by former batting coach Graham Gooch, Lyth\u2019s remorselessness caught the selectors\u2019 eye. He made 230 at Northampton, putting on 375 for the first wicket with the highly rated Alex Lees, then 251 against Lancashire at Old Trafford, one short of Darren Lehmann\u2019s Roses record. \u2018One of my things is that I\u2019ve never got enough runs,\u2019 said Lyth. \u2018If you\u2019re going to get a hundred, you may as well make it a big one.\u2019 Lyth\u2019s dedication has been evident for years. His mum Christine would drive him from game to game in his teenage years, and he spent two seasons trialling as a midfielder with Manchester City before deciding to throw in his lot with cricket (his brother Ashley played for Leicester and Scarborough). And his reluctance to talk about his footballing days tells of a man who wants to be judged by his run-making alone. When he phoned his mum to tell her about his selection, she was \u2018very emotional\u2019. Lyth bowls during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . As the home summer got under way with six university fixtures across the country, it was easy to forget that the first-class season actually began late last month in the Middle East. And, in the now annual fixture in Abu Dhabi between MCC and the champion county, Lyth made 113 and 46 not out as Yorkshire won by nine wickets. Watching on was Cook, who will have a big say in whether he walks out to bat in Antigua with Lyth or Trott, ready to play again after leaving the Ashes tour in November 2013 because of a stress-related condition. Lyth is suitably complimentary about a player with 49 Test caps to his name and an average pushing 47. \u2018He deserves his recall. He had a fantastic summer with Warwickshire and showed his class in South Africa with the Lions. \u2018It\u2019ll be very hard to keep the likes of him out of the side. I\u2019ve just got to concentrate on myself and impress in the nets.\u2019 The putting green may get a visit, too. Lyth is congratulated by team-mate Alex Lees (right) after taking the wicket of\u00a0Michael Carberry .",

Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in\u00a0Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The \u00a0name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is \u2018likely\u2019 to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by\u00a0Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged. This famous photograph, produced in 1934, was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, on his deathbed . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . Another renowned sighting was made in 2001 by semi-retired photographer James Gray and his friend Peter Levings when they were out fishing on the Loch . This blurred picture, said to show the Loch Ness Monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express .",

The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to \u00a330,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as\u00a0The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down. It was replaced by The Bristol Brewery Georges, which has since closed and been converted into flats. As it is today (right) Many uses: There was a builder, undertaker and joiner stationed at\u00a0Broad Quay Bristol when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855 . How Broad Quay Bristol looks now. It has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat . Little difference: The view through St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works . High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 . St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now . Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was\u00a0destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940.\u00a0Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed . Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol.\u00a0The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s . Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again . Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone . Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol. It is believed the set of pictures could fetch up to \u00a330,000 when they go up for auction tomorrow . This photo shows Host Street in Bristol.

But one Australian woman is making her nose job so public, it even has its own hashtag. Rhiannon Langley, from Melbourne, is sharing every step of the journey with hundreds of thousands of strangers, who can follow along on her social media accounts on the hashtag created just for the event, #RhiannonGetsRhino. Scroll down for video . Sharing is caring: Rhiannon Langley is posting her cosmetic surgery experience on social media through pictures and videos . Influencer: The 24-year-old from Melbourne has 189,000 followers on Instagram . The 24-year-old hairdresser has an almost 200,000-strong following on Instagram alone, and is keeping each of them updated while she undergoes Rhinoplasty in Thailand. Miss Langley is currently in Bangkok recovering at a hotel post-surgery, but has remained active on her social media accounts, posting videos on Snapchat and sharing snaps on Instagram. She informed her followers of her impending surgery via the latter one week ago. 'I've always wanted this since I was a lot younger, and I decided why not, if it makes me happy and improves my self esteem then I'm doing it!' she wrote. 'Yes plastic surgery is a controversial thing to do but this is my life and it's something I've wanted to do for so long and especially before my wedding.' Post-op selfie: Langley is currently in a Bangkok hotel recovering from surgery, but has remained active on social media . Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia from her hotel in Bangkok, Miss Langley\u00a0explained her motivation for going public further. 'I have quite a big following on social media and I don't want to lie about it,' she said. 'I think people are more accepting of the decision if you own it. 'I've seen so many other girls on social media get things done and then try and hide it. 'I have been a bit scared about getting negative feedback,' Rhiannon added, revealing that she kept hitting 'refresh' on her phone to read the comments coming through after she posted the announcement on Instagram. A little off here, and here:\u00a0Rhiannon revealed to Daily Mail Australia that her makeover will not be a subtle one, with changes being made to the shape and length of her nose . Holiday with a side of hospital: Rhiannon's $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' package included a stay in a Phuket beach hotel . Bedside view: Langley has been updating her followers with hospital snaps and post-op video messages . 'They've all been really positive and supportive though. Obviously you get a few weird comments, but it's been a lot better than I expected.' She also revealed to DMA that the results of the surgery will be 'quite drastic,' with changes made to the shape and length of her nose. But the true results won't show for another six months, when post-surgery swelling has gone down completely. Miss Langley wanted to share her experience with her followers, having found no one in her friendship circle to turn to for guidance on what the surgery and recovery would be like. 'None of my friends have had nose jobs, so I was searching on the Internet and couldn't find anything useful,' she said. 'I'm owning my decision': Rhiannon says  that she decided to be honest rather than hiding it from her followers . 'So I decided to post about my experience, post photos, share how I feel, how I look, and what I've gone through.' Miss Langley is sharing videos and pictures day-by-day on her Snapchat and Instagram accounts respectively, and is planning blog posts as well as filming a video diary throughout her 'journey'. The trip to Thailand started out as a relaxing beach holiday for Langley and fianc\u00e9 Jody Abrahams, before the couple travelled to Bangkok for the surgery. Her sunny vacation snaps and videos have been replaced with confronting, raw glimpses of Langley in recovery, sporting a swollen face and bruised purple eyes. Nuptials: Langley says her Thailand medical tourism package holiday was financially motivated, as she cannot afford surgery in Australia with her upcoming wedding to fianc\u00e9 Jody (pictured) to pay for . Rhiannon says her motivation to take her surgery overseas was financially motivated. 'The price difference [between Australia and Thailand] is huge,' she told DMA. 'I'm getting married in a year, so I couldn't afford to have the surgery in Australia.' Her trip to Thailand is a $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' package with CosMediTour. The Medical Tourism Agency has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that while they have assisted the social media influencer with finding accommodation, Langley paid the full rate for her surgery package. The packages include four to five star accommodation and meals, as well as the full cost of hospitalisation and surgery. Dream: The hair dresser has wanted the nose correction since she was a teenager . 'Rhiannon had been considering Rhinoplasty for a long time and she approached CosMediTour after being referred from a friend who previously had surgery through CosMediTour. We are very happy to have her as a client,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Rhiannon has a loyal Instagram following and she wanted to Blog about her Rhinoplasty experience as it was something that she didn't want to hide. 'We use fully accredited hospitals with internationally trained and highly skilled Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and have CosMediTour personnel in all destinations. We create four and five star packages which include surgery, accommodation, transfers, meals and don't charge any additional agency fee for our services.' Langley said she has wanted nose correction surgery since she was a teen, and wanted it done before her wedding to Abrahams in 2016. 'He likes me as I am now, but he supports my decision and is here taking care of me,' Rhiannon said. And she wasn't put off by recent criticism of the industry following the death of Gold Coast woman,\u00a0Evita Nicole Sarmonikas, in Mexico after a reported buttock implants, or the story of\u00a0Courtney O'Keefe, from Perth, who contracted a life-threatening infection following breast enlargement surgery in Thailand. 'I have had a lot of friends use Cosmeditour for boob jobs and tummy tucks, and have seen such good results,' so I didn't hesitate for a second,' said Langley. Langley started her blog and Instagram accounts two years ago as a way to promote her home hairdressing business. Her following has grown to over 189,000, and the pretty brunette has capitalised on her popularity, launching a body oil business and working on a swimwear line.",

Woods has started just two events in 2015, shooting a career-worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on February 5. That led to the 14-time major winner taking a break from competition to work on his game, during which time he dropped outside the world's top 100 for the first time since September 1996, a slide which continued on Monday as he fell from 104th to 111th. Tiger Woods returned to action as he warmed up at Augusta National Golf Club ahead of The Masters . The 39-year-old is returning from a self-imposed break from golf to recover from injuries and a dip in form . Woods was given a warm welcome by the crowd and stopped to sign several autographs at Augusta . Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the 39-year-old only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta. However, after showing no sign of the chipping 'yips' which blighted his performance in Phoenix on the range, Woods produced some vintage shots as he completed the front nine alongside long-time friend Mark O'Meara before playing the 10th and 18th alone. 'I felt good. It was nice to get out here,' said Woods, who was two under after four holes despite a wayward drive on the first and three-putting the par-five second for a par. 'Chipping is fine. I wanted to test out some wedges out here. That was why I was chipping a little bit more. It came down to a couple of different bounce settings because it's different from Florida. We figured the right one out. 'It's been a process. But I'm on the good side now. It's progression. I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament and it's finally there.' Woods has not won a major since the US Open in 2008 and will be looking to get back to his best . Woods stopped to chat to Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta on Monday . O'Meara, who won the Masters and Open in 1998, said: 'The thing about the kid is that you can never underestimate Tiger Woods. I'm a huge fan, a friend and I care about him. 'It was good to be out there with him. I saw some good signs. His pitching looks a lot better. 'There's a lot of pressure on him but there is no reason why he should not have a good week this week. 'There are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has. The game of golf is better because of Tiger Woods. 'He is in a good place and I think he is fired up about it. He will be nervous on Thursday but I think he will be fine. He hit a couple of shots that were a little off but a lot of quality shots.' Earlier in the day, US Open champion Martin Kaymer said he still felt Woods was 'the man,' but added: 'Who really knows what is going on in his head? Woods looked confident and managed to pull off some impressive drives in front of the crowd . Woods hits a chip shot on to the green during the practice session ahead of the Masters 2015 . Woods smiles during the practice round prior to the tee off of the 2015 Masters on Thursday . 'I hope he's happy. I hope he's fine. I hope he will play well this week. But what would bother me a lot is all the speculation. You don't have a choice; you will read about it somewhere. You will hear about it because you socialise with people. 'So mentally it must be quite exhausting and we know how important the mental part is in golf. It's difficult and some things I don't find very fair. You know, you should just let him be. Let him play golf, what he likes to do. 'Sometimes I look at it and find it quite sad how people treat the whole subject. It shouldn't be like this in my opinion. But that's how it is unfortunately. That is how a lot of people make their money and some athletes, they suffer because of that. 'Hopefully he's strong enough, he has people to talk to, and he finds a way to compete as good as he can. Because we all know when he's around, somehow it does make us play better, as well. 'I never experienced someone who played better than him. In my era, I never played with Seve (Ballesteros) and I never played with Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, those guys. So for me, what I have seen and what I have experienced, he's the man.'",

The Gunners romped to a 4-1 win over Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, which was a seventh successive Barclays Premier League victory and moved them up into second place. While Manchester City could reclaim second by beating Crystal Palace on Monday and the title looks out of reach as Chelsea remain seven points ahead with a match in hand, there is no doubt when Wenger has all of his squad available Arsenal are capable of giving anyone a run for their money. Right back Hector Bellerin gave Arsenal the lead with a superb left-foot curling into the corner to get things going at the Emirates Stadium . Bellerin broke the Emirates deadlock for Arsenal, cutting in from his native right-hand side and curling a left-foot strike into the corner . Although there was disappointment at failure to progress in Europe following elimination by Monaco, the prospect of an improved league finish and successful FA Cup defence remains very much on the agenda. Wenger, who was often criticised over the direction of his team following almost a decade without a trophy, feels finally things are starting to come together. 'We have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team,' he said. 'There is something happening, that shows you that they are ready to fight for each other. Mesut Ozil is congratulated by his team-mates after his magnificent free-kick on the half hour mark put Arsenal fully in control of the game . 'You can see that, you can't cheat on that, people smell that. 'It of course is a good basis, and defensively we are getting better.' Following a poor start to the campaign, Arsenal were expected to struggle to sustain a place in the top four. Wenger, though, will not get complacent. 'I am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look, but what is true is that it's in our hands. How well we deal with the situation now will be important,' he said. Alexis Sanchez celebrates with Olivier Giroud after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area made it 3-0 to Arsenal in the first half . Wenger has his sights set on getting as close to Chelsea as possible, with the leaders set to come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26. 'I am a competitor and what that means is you have to go as high and as far as you can. When you go home if somebody was better than us, then 'well done', but we have to have given our best until the end and that is what I would like to do,' he said. 'Let's give everything to do it and see what happens. But Olivier Giroud ended any hopes of a Liverpool comeback by smashing in a fantastic fourth for Arsenal in stoppage time . 'We are in a good position, with four games at home and only three away. 'We are on a good run, so I would say that it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and level of urgency between now and the end of the season.' After failing to make the most of their positive start on Saturday, Arsenal had to soak up some pressure from Liverpool, with Raheem Sterling failing to capitalise when put in on goal. A huge flag is waved as Nacho Monreal and Giroud are among the first team-mates to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer . The Gunners finally broke the deadlock through the unlikely source of full-back Hector Bellerin, who slotted home a fine left-foot curling effort on 37 minutes. It proved the catalyst for an onslaught, with Mesut Ozil's free-kick and a rocket by Alexis Sanchez on the stroke of half-time effectively ending the contest. After Arsenal's tempo dropped, Liverpool reduced the arrears with a penalty from Jordan Henderson, but following the dismissal of Emre Can for a second yellow card, Olivier Giroud cracked home a late fourth to cap a memorable afternoon's work. Sanchez got in on the goalscoring act just before half-time, finding space outside the box to smash a drive over the head of keeper Mignolet . Wenger admits he has been impressed by the work-rate of both Bellerin and defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin, who were each drafted into the first-team as cover for injury, but are now an integral part of the side. Asked if either man was in his thoughts at the start of the season, Wenger said: 'Honestly, no. But my job is to remain open-minded and make decisions when you have to. '(I picked Bellerin against Liverpool) because of his pace. 'I thought (Daniel) Sturridge would play and then Sterling would have gone on the flank. Francis Coquelin challenges Daniel Sturridge During the Barclays Premier League match  at Emirates Stadium . 'Because of his low centre of gravity, Sterling changes direction very quickly and Hector is short as well.' Wenger added: 'I think you also have to give credit to players who get less, such as Coquelin. 'In the first half he broke up many attacks in a convincing way. 'But honestly I couldn't say that in my head (at the start of the season) Coquelin was one of the first-choice players.'",

The experimental espresso machine is intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. Scroll down for video . This undated image shows a prototype of Lavazza and Argotec's 'ISSpresso' machine. The final version will be the first real Italian espresso machine on The International Space Station . On Monday a version of the coffee maker is scheduled for launch to the International Space Station aboard a supply capsule which will also include 4,000 pounds of\u00a0food, science research and other equipment . It was supposed to arrive in January, shortly after her arrival, so she could get some relief from the station's instant coffee. But it ended up on the back burner after a station shipment from Virginia was lost in a launch explosion. The espresso machine was originally intended for astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy so she could get a break from the station's instant coffee . The espresso maker is dubbed ISSpresso \u2014 ISS standing for International Space Station. Italian coffee giant Lavazza joined forces with the Turin-based engineering company Argotec and the Italian Space Agency to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet. NASA certified its safety. It is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the ISS, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth. It uses a 'capsule system' to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea. The machine can also be used to rehydrate food. In order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment, the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar. The ISSpresso machine uses a standard coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' The ISSpresso machine is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on earth . Hovering up to 270 miles (435 km) above the Earth, the International Space Station (pictured) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer . Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. The machine is much heavier than a normal model, which typically weighs 29lbs (13kg). The space-bound machine weighs around 44lbs (20kg) because there are backups of all the critical components, for safety reasons, and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the ISA. NASA's space station program deputy manager, Dan Hartman, said it's all part of making astronauts feel at home as they spend months \u2014 and even up to a year \u2014 in orbit. Already, Mission Control gives astronauts full access to email, phone calls, private video hookups, and live news and sports broadcasts. The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. 'The psychological support is very, very important,' Hartman told reporters on Sunday. He continued: 'If an espresso machine comes back and we get a lot of great comments from the crew... It's kind of like the ice cream thing, right, when we fly ice cream every now and then. 'It's just to boost spirits. Maybe some rough day, a scoop of ice cream gets them over that hump kind of thing.' The SpaceX Dragon supply ship also holds experiments for NASA's one-year space station resident Scott Kelly, who moved in a couple weeks ago. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016. This will be the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. For the third time, SpaceX will attempt to land its leftover booster vertically on an ocean barge. Both previous tests failed. Improvements to the first-stage booster and floating platform \u2014 based on lessons learned from the January and February attempts \u2014 should boost the odds of success this time to 75 per cent or maybe 80 per cent, said Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of mission assurance for SpaceX. SpaceX's billionaire founder Elon Musk wants to save time and money by reusing the boosters normally discarded in the Atlantic. In fact, the company is transforming a former missile-launching site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station into a landing pad for its revolutionary flyback boosters. Monday's launch time is 4.33pm. Forecasters put the odds of good weather at 60 per cent. Once the coffee is brewed, it's dispensed in a pouch, which astronauts drink straight from using a straw .",

Following one stunning round with another happens about as often at Augusta National as pieces of litter drifting across the property. Here, the youngest first-round leader in Masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36-hole record total of 14 under par, beating the old mark of 13 under set by Ray Floyd way back in 1976. It also tied the lowest 36-hole total seen in a major, set by three others, including Sir Nick Faldo at The Open. Jordan Spieth chips on the 17th hole during the second round of the Masters on Friday . Spieth watches his tee shot from the 16th in front of a packed crowd at Augusta . The 21-year-old walks past the scoreboard on the 18th hole following his sensational performance . Dustin Johnson eyes up a putt no the 18th green during his record-breaking display on Friday . Johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course\u2019s scoreable par fives to devastating effect. He had eagles at the second and the 8th, birdied the 13th, before striking a wondrous blow to the 15th that pulled up 12 inches from the flag. The difference between him and Spieth is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67. Johnson will start the third round seven behind his fellow American with game chorus line member Charley Hoffman two strokes nearer the lead following a creditable 68. Gutsy Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey are on the same mark as Johnson, with the former weighing in with a fine recovery of his own. Rose was three over par after four holes but rallied strongly after drawing a line on his scorecard, like you\u2019d draw a line in the sand. He played the last 14 holes in a plucky five under for a 70, while Casey underlined he is a man reborn with a terrific bogey-free 68. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68, one shot ahead of Ernie Els (72), while Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69, his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors, and his first here since 2011. He is still no fewer than 12 shots behind, mind. What of the world No 1, Rory McIlroy? Alas, if it\u2019s Friday it must be time for one of those freaky nine holes that just kill him at the Masters every time. Ernie Els hits a shot off the fourth tee during his second day of action . Last year it was on the back nine and this time the outward half, as he followed a bogey at the 7th with a double at the 9th to turn in 40 strokes. It\u2019s the sixth year in a row the Northern Irishman has thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he addresses the problem, he simply cannot win a green jacket. At least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he has made mentally from the days when his shoulders used to slump. One shot outside the projected halfway cut mark, he birdied the 10th and then, at the 13th, the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past, he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap-in eagle three. McIlroy missed from 3ft at the 14th for a par but, in a rousing finish, birdied the 15th, 17th and the 18th. To the accompaniment of loud rumbles of thunder in the distance, McIlroy came home in just 31 shots to stand alongside Woods on two under. Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69; his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors . Woods's girlfriend\u00a0Lindsey Vonn watches on from the crowd during the second day of action . Texas golfers have a long and proud history of coming up with prodigious feats that stun the sporting world. Byron Nelson once won 11 events in a row on the PGA Tour in 1945. Ben Hogan won three major championships in succession in 1953 and probably would have won the fourth as well but for the fact The Open clashed that year with the USPGA. Now here comes Spieth, who to this point has turned this Masters into his very own \u2018hello, world\u2019 moment with an awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we haven\u2019t seen since another 21-year-old named Tiger walked away with the 1997 edition. All this on the day another Lone Star legend, Ben Crenshaw, waved goodbye to the Masters. It\u2019s tempting to talk about a passing of the Texas torch, except Spieth is destined for a level of greatness twice Masters champion Crenshaw could only dream about. Think Hogan rather than Gentle Ben. Rory McIlroy reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what was a frustrating day for the World No 1 . Paul Casey tries to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole . As for Tiger, his first round 73 was actually an awful lot better than his score and the reviews suggested. It was, in fact, the most encouraging signs we\u2019ve seen for him for well over a year. His short game was back to its best and his task on Friday was to instil some rhythm in his long game. That is exactly what happened. The rare sight of him finding the first fairway was encouraging and even better was the laser iron that followed. It finished 10ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole. For 15 minutes, it was like watching Tiger at his best. The rest of the round was also heartening. He reached the turn in 34 to be one under for the event and inside the top 20. Justin Rose flips his club into the air after the English golfer cleared a sand trap on the 13th green . Ben Crenshaw closed out his Masters career with two mediocre rounds at Augusta . A birdie at the 11th and he was on the fringes of the top ten. How he does over the final two rounds is one more fascinating question during a weekend featuring many. Els was trying to build on the small miracle of his opening 67. The South African finished eighth on his Augusta National debut in 1994. Two months later, at the age of 25, he claimed the United States Open. Everyone looked at his languid grace off the tee and gossamer touch around the greens and wondered how many green jackets he would win. Twenty years on, he\u2019s still waiting for his first. But he\u2019s still in there trying. Depending on your viewpoint, his 72 leaves him perfectly placed to take advantage if Spieth feels the pressure over the weekend; or well in the mix to notch his third runner-up finish at the Masters. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68 just one shot ahead of Els .",

However, he starts today for the Blues and will be fired up to demonstrate his clout as a strong carrier who can also more than hold his own in the scrum battle. Leinster's Rob Kearney (right) is a real threat as a strike runner . Jamie Heaslip . The experienced No 8 missed the visit of England after suffering fractured vertebrae in his back caused by the knee of France lock Pascal Pape. These are the days \u2014 the big occasions \u2014 when he raises his game: strutting, charging and hitting rucks. Rob Kearney . The Ireland full back is imperious under the high ball so the Test encounter with England last month suited him perfectly. He will be keen to provide a reminder of his threat as a strike runner but he also provides a crucial kicking outlet if the hosts are pinned down. Sean O\u2019Brien . He\u2019s known as the \u2018Tullow Tank\u2019 and it is easy to understand how he came by that nickname. The Lions flanker is an imposing force of nature at full throttle. He will blast holes in the best defences and commit body and soul to every collision with a madcap, reckless intensity.",

When the students got their class photos this week, she saw the word had been removed from her shirt with Photoshop. Sophie Thomas (center) wore a shirt with the word 'feminist' on it for class photo day at her middle school . Administrators at\u00a0Clermont Northeastern Middle School in Batavia, Ohio, had word removed from her shirt . Thomas had worn the shirt to school in the past without any problems, FOX19 NOW\u00a0reported. School principal Kendra Young said the word was removed to 'prevent any unintended controversies'. Thomas, an eighth grader at the school, had worn the shirt in the past without having any problems . The school claimed it told Thomas the word was going to be removed from her shirt, but she said that is not the case, as does her mother, according to TODAY.com. Christine Thomas said her daughter only met with school officials after the doctored photo was released. Thomas said: 'I was upset. 'I went to the principal's office and she told me she blacked it out because it's offensive to some people.' Ralph Shell, the superintendent of the Clermont Northeastern School District, said the situation was 'blown out of proportion',\u00a0BuzzFeed News\u00a0reported. He added: 'We took the photo and she was in the front row with the T-shirt on, and it was just not a flattering picture.' On April 17, Thomas asked people to post photos using the #IDESERVEFREEDOMOFEXPRESSION hashtag . On Friday, April 17, Thomas asked people who found the school's decision distasteful to wear a shirt showing their support for feminism or freedom of expression and post photos with the hashtag #IDESERVEFREEDOMOFEXPRESSION. The photos were collected on Instagram. She said: 'People around here misconstrue the word [feminism].' 'Like, 'Oh, you're a feminist so you hate men.' 'I just want to spread equality, and a lot of people here don't agree with me.'",

Heartbroken owner Tony Tancock believes only an expert could have targetted the dozen show-quality guinea pigs stolen leaving more ordinary rodents behind. Tony, 56, has won accolades for his specially-bred cavies and has shown them off at events around the country. But he was devastated after a thief snuck into an outbuilding at his home in Crediton, Devon, to steal his prized pets leaving eight behind. Robbed: Police investigating the theft of 12 prize-winning guinea pigs from top breeder Tony Tancock (pictured) have not ruled out - a rival competitor . Sabotage: Heartbroken owner Tancock (pictured) believes only an expert could have targetted the dozen show-quality guinea pigs . He said: 'They knew exactly what they were looking for. They took two tortoiseshells, two black and two brown, all short-haired guinea pigs that besides being show-quality, were also beloved family pets. 'They left six which were not show quality, plus two other show ones.' Tony yesterday issued a desperate plea to the thief to return the treasured pets to him. He said: 'Please bring them back. I miss them dearly and am really worried about them. I would like to know they didn't just get bumped off. They were priceless to me.' Guinea pig fancying took off in the 1890s but a fascination for the furry animals began when they were introduced to Britain from South America in the 1500s. They are still bred for their meat in several countries on the South American continent and are a particular delicacy in the Andes. The biggest event in a guinea pig fanciers calendar - the Bradford Championship Show - draws hundreds of participating critters, competing in categories separated according to breeds. But Tony said that unless his guinea pigs are returned he will not be able to appear at any shows this year. A cavy expert has warned the thefts could be a hate crime from someone with a score to settle. But Bryan Mayoh, chairman of the British Cavy Council, expressed shock at the suggestion a fellow competitor could have deliberately targeted Tony. Heart-broken: Mr Tancock was devastated after a thief snuck into an outbuilding at his home in Crediton, Devon, to steal his prized pets leaving eight behind . He said: 'I would suggest that a personal dispute is a far more likely explanation than that some person was envious of his cavies. 'Real fanciers know how important cavies are to other fanciers and would not dream of trying to steal animals from them. 'In addition, it is very likely that someone attempting to remove cavies at a show would be noticed by other fanciers. 'In 25 years of showing I never had a cavy stolen, nor have any of my fancier friends.' 'But my advice would be to be vigilant of anyone behaving suspiciously at a show and ensure that garden sheds in which cavies are kept at home are padlocked when the owner is absent.' Police say they are investigating the thefts and asked anyone with information to contact them on 101.",

Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with his Thai girlfriend moments before his death. He is also understood to have clashed with a man who was seen talking to his girlfriend at a bar. The incidents happened in Hua Hin, a coastal town and beach resort 120 miles south-west of Bangkok. Tragic: Iain Mackay, 40, (pictured) is understood to have got into a fight at the Hua Hin resort, 125 miles south of Bangkok, after discovering the woman chatting with another man at a bar in the coastal city . Thai police said Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a shop near to the bar where he had spotted his girlfriend. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed. However, friends of Mr Mackay claim that he had clashed with another man who had been talking to his girlfriend moments before his death, the Press and Journal newspaper reported. Others said that Mr Mackay had posted links to his girlfriend\u2019s Facebook page before his death in which she was pictured with another man. One friend said: \u2018Iain was obviously upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.\u2019 Those close to Mr Mackay said he had been in a relationship with his girlfriend for several years. Mr Mackay, an underwater research specialist, is believed to have been employed by seismic research company Polarcus, which is based in Dubai. Location: The resort where Mr Mackay died is in Hua Hin (pictured) - a coastal city 125 miles south of Bangkok . Sources at the company confirmed that Mr Mackay was on leave from his vessel and had told colleagues that he planned to spend his time off in Thailand. Thai officials said that Mr Mackay had died at 3pm on Saturday but relatives claim that they were told of his death on Friday. The Foreign Office also confirmed that Mr Mackay had died on Friday. A spokesman said: \u2018We can confirm the death of a British national in Hua Hin, Thailand, on April 3. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.\u2019 Mr Mackay\u2019s death comes nine years after a British former public schoolboy was murdered after splitting with his Thai wife at the Hua Hin resort. Toby Charnaud, 41, was beaten to death with an iron bar and wooden staves by relatives of his ex-wife, Pannada Laoruang, in August 2006. Laoruang then helped them burn his body before chopping it up and scattering the remains. A Thai court at the time heard how Mr Charnaud, who was educated at Marlborough College, sold \u00a32.5million Latimer Manor estate near Chippenham, Wiltshire, after falling in love with 35-year-old Laoruang, whom he met in a Bangkok bar while on holiday. Last year British students Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao. Two Burmese men have been charged with their murder.

What is retrograde amnesia? Amnesia is the name given to a disturbance in the ability to recall stored memories. It is usually caused by disease or head injury, but in rare cases can occur apparently spontaneously. The memory loss associated with amnesia can include everything from a person's past or just portions of it. In most cases, it is a temporary condition, lasting from a few seconds to a few hours. But in severe cases, it can last months or even years. There are several different types of amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is an inability to remember any events that occurred before the accident or illness. The leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like phenomenon. Usually, the affected person cannot remember events shortly before their accident or illness at all, but their memories of the distant past are intact, and there is a gradient of memory loss between the two extremes. Retrograde amnesia often lasts for a year, before the patient starts to remember things.",

Steve Tempest-Mitchell, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, lost a whopping 16st after the surgery 14 months ago, which caused his stomach to shrink to the size of a tennis ball. The 56-year-old said he decided to go through with the operation after hitting 32st and struggling to control his Type 2 diabetes. Scroll down for video . Slim and trim: Steve Tempest-Mitchell says he has a new lease of life after slimming down from 32st to 16st . 'It was a case of going in for the surgery and hoping to come out the other side,' said the father-of-three. This was a life changing and life threatening decision for me to make. 'At 32st, it was not an easy decision as I had been turned down for the surgery two and a half years previously . 'It had got to a point where something had to be done because I was slowly killing myself. I was just waiting for something awful to happen and even needed psychiatric help.' Although he never indulged in binge-eating, Mr Tempest-Mitchell says he would eat smaller portions at regular intervals and was drinking around eight cans of cola a day. But the former bomb disposal expert hadn't always been big and he says that growing up, he lived an active lifestyle, regularly playing rugby and competing in wrestling. Flashback: Mr Tempest-Mitchell said he was almost a recluse when he was at his biggest (above) As he got older, he began to struggle with his weight thanks to a lifestyle of long-haul flights, business meetings and boozy evenings spent entertaining clients. Mr Tempest-Mitchell also had to contend with some highly stressful situations while working as a bomb disposal expert between 1996 and 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he was employed as a contractor with the Ministry of Defence. Using high-pressure water technology, he would set about the grim task of defusing bombs. 'It was a very stressful situation,' he explains. 'Not only have you got to handle the situation of defusing the threat of the bomb but you are in dangerous territory as well under guard from soldiers. Helping hand: The former bomb disposal expert said he needed to be pushed in a wheelchair to board a plane . 'We were very lucky as one of the bases we were stationed at was attacked by a rocket launcher just weeks after we left.' Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who is now a business development manager at a demolition and asbestos removal firm, said as the years went by, his weight crept up. 'I had a very active lifestyle before my work and life balance was disrupted and I began to not have time to eat right,' he said. 'I was never one of those people who would eat massive amounts of food where you are stunned by the amount but I did have small portions regularly. 'Ever since I was a child, I always drank coke. At one point, I was having between six to eight cans a day. I have had to completely cut coke out of my life as well as other fizzy drinks. I don't mind if I never have one again.' The father-of-three said his weight affected his self confidence and esteem . As a result of the weight gain, Mr Tempest-Mitchell almost became housebound at his heaviest and was forced to plan every trip out. His weight issues even affected his working life, as well as his confidence and self esteem. 'I was forced to park the car as close as possible to wherever I was going, if I couldn't, I'd have to turn back and go home,' he recalls. 'I was almost becoming a recluse as I was unable to visit sites for my work so instead worked from home. I was becoming a burden on my family, especially when we tried to go on holiday. I had to be taken to the plane by a buggy or wheelchair.' Fed up, he took the plunge and opted for surgery - a decision that coincided with him finding that he was about to become a grandfather. Both of his daughters, aged 26 and 36, were expecting babies. 'My one daughter came to see me while I was recovering from the operation and broke the news that she was pregnant,' said Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who also has a 34-year-old son. Although he never indulged in eating too many snacks, he said he would drink up to eight cans of coke a day . 'I was so thrilled as I knew the success of the surgery would allow me to be more active and enjoy spending time with them as they are growing up.' As well as losing more than a stone a month, he has also seen his waist shrink from 66 inches to 42 inches and his chest go down from 66 inches to 48 inches. 'Now I feel like I am a new man,' he said. 'I have the energy to play with my grandchildren, who are both nearly one, which I would not have been able to do before.'",

The 'Cripmas' party, held last December, had white students throwing stereotypical gang symbols while dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and fake 'thug' tattoos. The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities. Photos from the party flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity at Clemson University in South Carolina has been put on probation for two years after the group held a Christmas theme party that flared up racial tensions on campus . Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting last December's frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes . The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California. The incident caused a backlash as black students protested and said Clemson didn't do enough to promote racial tolerance. About 6 percent of Clemson's students are black. All SAE activity was suspended by Clemson indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party. Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation found that the fraternity violated alcohol rules and student conduct codes. It will be on probation until February 2017. Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students last December making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and that such events would not be tolerated. White students dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and sported fake 'thug' tattoos . Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year \u2013 all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night's ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this. He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. 'But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.' A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was disbanded last month after members were taped singing a racist song. The national organization didn't respond to messages seeking comment. Photos from the party flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night'",

New Zealand international Reid ended speculation about his future when he penned a six-and-a-half year deal with the Irons last month. The 26-year-old, signed from Danish side Midtjylland in August 2010, had been linked with the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham. Winston Reid signed six-and-a-half-year deal with West Ham last month .

However, Reid believes he can fulfil all of his ambitions at West Ham, who are set to move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016/2017. 'I think this club will eventually be a very big one, but it's going to take time and probably not over the next couple of years,' he said. 'It is going to take a lot of hard work by everybody, but I wouldn't have signed a new contract if I didn't think we could achieve something to get into the top tier of English football. 'We just have to work hard at it and make sure the results get better.'

Reid added: 'One of the reasons (I signed) was that I could see myself as an important part of the squad for the next six years of my career. 'My family are happy here; I have a good relationship with the people at the club and most importantly I wanted to give something back to a club that took a chance on me. 'I took all those factors into consideration and footballing-wise I really do believe we can achieve something.

CNN reported Tuesday, citing US officials briefed on the months-long investigation conducted by the FBI and Secret Service, that the hackers were able to access real-time, non-public schedule of President Obama, which is regarded as highly sensitive information that is sought after by foreign intelligence agencies. In October 2014, the White House acknowledged that there had been suspicious activity on its unclassified network serving the executive office, prompting system shutdowns and security upgrades. Vulnerable: A new report has revealed that Russian hackers launched a cyber-attack against White House's unclassified computer network last year . Privacy concerns: The hackers reportedly accessed President Obama's non-public schedule, which is considered highly sensitive information . Sneak attack:\u00a0According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network . A six-month investigation into the breach, described as one of the most sophisticated attacks against the US, reportedly uncovered evidence pointing to hackers working on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. According to federal officials involved in the probe, the hackers wormed their way into the White House system by breaching first the State Department's network. To accomplish this task, the cyber-bandits allegedly working for the Kremlin commandeered a State Department email account and sent a phishing email to someone at the White House designed to trick the recipient into downloading malicious software. Silver lining: White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said last year's cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information . Once downloaded onto a White House computer, the malware presumably allowed the hackers to penetrate the unclassified network containing Obama's schedule that is not accessible to the general public. According to an anonymous government official, the hackers have been able to re-enter the State Department computer system, despite efforts to keep them out. The Russian Embassy did not publicly comment on the hacking allegations . The White House responded to CNN\u2019s revelations by saying the report did not refer to a new incident but was \u2018speculating\u2019 about the source of cyber activities that were disclosed last year. Spokesman Mark Stroh said in a statement that the White House would not comment on CNN's attribution of the cyber-attack to Russian hackers. \u2018Any such activity is something we take very seriously. In this case, as we made clear at the time, we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity,\u2019 Stroh stated. \u2018As has been our position, we are not going to comment on the referenced article's attribution to specific actors.\u2019 White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said in an appearance on CNN Tuesday that the White House in 2014 disclosed cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information. \u2018We have an unclassified system and then we have a classified system, a top secret system,\u2019 Rhodes said. \u2018We do not believe that our classified systems were compromised.\u2019 But he said, \u2018There's always vulnerability.\u2019 For that reason, Rhodes said the White House operates a separate, secure system for classified data. He assured the public that the White House takes regular actions to prevent intrusions on its unclassified network.",

The vital findings have been suppressed for nearly four months, and have only emerged now after the Care Quality Commission quietly revised its report to rate many of the hospital's services as 'good'. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' and placed it in special measures, along with a dozen of the worst hospitals in the country. But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up by Labour Party activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation. The new version of the report rates the hospital as 'good' in 18 out of 33 criteria that were assessed including its outpatients departments and overall standard of end-of-life care. It also praises a number of the hospital's departments and individuals as 'outstanding' including its maternity ward, intensive care unit, specialist children's nurse in A&E and the chaplain. Crucially, the report \u2013 a draft of which has been leaked to the Mail \u2013 shows that the CQC ignored a second, far more positive spot check of the hospital when it published its initial report. In January \u2013 a week before the first report came out \u2013 inspectors returned to check up on two wards where they had raised concerns about standards of care during a visit in September. They found major improvements and praised nurses for treating patients with dignity and respect, responding promptly to call bells and ensuring patients were not in pain. Yet the watchdog ignored these findings when placing the hospital in special measures. Hinchingbrooke \u2013 which serves 160,000 patients in Huntingdon \u2013 was controlled by the private firm Circle from February 2012 until last month. NHS patients were treated there as usual but Circle \u2013 rather than NHS managers \u2013 was in charge of the day-to-day running of the hospital and its budget. The firm was praised for driving down waiting times, lowering the death rate, reducing infections and improving overall care. After January's report Circle announced it would be withdrawing from its contract. The hospital is now being run by the NHS Trust Development Authority. The rating of 'requires improvement' in the revised report moves the hospital from the bottom 13 per cent of hospital trusts in the country to an average score, which is achieved by 59 per cent of organisations. Today the watchdog will upgrade the 'inadequate' finding to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report . The Mail has repeatedly highlighted concerns by MPs and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation. One of the inspectors was a member of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. Another was a senior figure in the British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, who had previously spoken out about the dangers of private firms' involvement in the NHS. Neither took part in the spot checks a week before January's report. Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman said: 'This is an extraordinary procedure and raises serious questions about how the CQC goes about its inspections. 'It's an admission by the watchdog that its first inspection report was over the top and far too tough. It's all been heavily influenced by the public service unions. I will be writing to the Health Secretary to demand a full investigation into whether this was a stitch-up.' A spokesman for Circle said: 'This vindicates our view that the inspection of Hinchingbrooke was flawed. The evidence has always been that Hinchingbrooke was a good hospital, with low mortality rates, low waiting times, and positive reviews from other NHS regulators.'",

The High Court threw out rules introduced to stop violent prisoners being transferred out of high-security jails. The policy was brought in after fugitive armed robber Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker \u2013 walked out of an open jail in May while on day release  despite a history of prison escapes. Michael Wheatley - nicknamed the Skull Cracker \u2013 walked out of an open jail in May while on day release and went on to commit an armed robbery which was caught on CCTV (left) Wheatley absconding from Standford Hill prison in Kent  and went on a robbing spree \u2013 pulling a handgun on staff at the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. After being caught he was told that he must serve at least eight years in jail before becoming eligible to apply for release on parole. The violent thug had previously been handed 13 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002 and earned his nickname by pistol-whipping his victims. Following the scandal, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling publicly announced that the Government was 'tearing up the system as it exists at the moment' and introduced his absconder policy. But two senior judges at London's High Court have ruled that excluding transfers  for prisoners with a history of absconding was unlawful. Wheatley was eligible for release after eight years, had been on the run after leaving Standford Hill open prison in Kent on day release and failing to return. He was arrested alongside another man in Tower Hamlets, east London, after an armed robbery at a Chelsea Building Society branch in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. The Ministry of Justice today announced they would appeal against the ruling. New rules were introduced after  Wheatley walked out of an open jail in May while on day release last year despite a history of prison escapes . A spokesman said: 'The fundamental principles of the policy are not unlawful. The court found there was inconsistency with the implementation. 'Our position remains that temporary release can be an important part of rehabilitating offenders but not at the cost of public protection. We are appealing this decision.' But the Prisoners' Advice Service, a charity offering free legal advice and support to adult prisoners, described the absconder policy as a 'knee jerk reaction' by Mr Grayling. The charity said in a statement: 'The Secretary of State's contention that he is entitled to ignore and contradict his own policy guidance demonstrates either his ignorance or flagrant disregard for basic legal principles of consistency and transparency in public decision making. 'The so called 'absconder policy' was introduced as a knee jerk reaction to negative press reports without adequate consideration for either existing policies, or its impact on the prisoners whose progression to open conditions was abruptly prevented.'",

A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\" Any additional funds raised will be \"paid forward\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.",

Sportsmail's Oliver Todd rated the player's performances at Ewood Park. BLACKBURN ROVERS: (4-4-2) Eastwood 7 . Could do nothing to stop Philippe Coutinho's winner but did well to deny Brazilian in the first half and even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time. Simon\u00a0even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time after performing well in goal . Henley 7 . Solid at right back, he kept Raheem Sterling quieter than most full backs in the Barclays Premier League would. Restricted in going forward as he kept an eye on England star. Baptiste 8 . So often found in the way of Liverpool's shots, even though he was suffering with a hamstring injury. Performed heroics at the back but couldn't quite hold out before being substituted. Kilgallon 8 . Another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge he faced from Daniel Sturridge and mainly restricted the England striker to potshots from range. Matt Kilgallon was another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge of Daniel Sturridge . Olsson 7 . Could have gone down when under pressure inside the Liverpool area but his honesty was his own enemy. Solid at the back. Conway 6.5 . Industrious down the right but often restricted as he looked to double up on dangerous Sterling. Corry Evans is no stranger to a challenge, and he put himself about in midfield, replacing Jay Spearing . Evans 6.5 . No stranger to a challenge, put himself about in midfield after replacing cup-tied Jay Spearing. Booked for desperate challenge on Sterling. Williamson 7 . Tracked back really well and did his best to neutralise the threat of Coutinho. Could have given away a penalty in stoppage time for challenge on Joe Allen but referee made right decision. Marshall 7 . Creative force. Provided the ammo for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they looked to take advantage of an unfamiliar back-line. Unlucky to be denied by Simon Mignolet. Ben Marshall was unlucky to be denied when his header was saved by Simon Mignolet in the second half . Cairney 6.5 . Anonymous at times but then tested Mignolet from range as Rovers grew into the game early in the second half. Rhodes 6.5 . Subdued upfront and looked a poor replacement for Gestede who had impressed at Anfield. Missed with key header in the first half. Subs . Gestede 6.5 (for\u00a0Conway 64) Came on to energise Blackburn as Liverpool took control but aside from one chance he showed a lack of match fitness, struggling with a hamstring problem. Spurr (for Baptiste\u00a079) No time to make an impact but kept things together well. Rudy Gestede came on to energise Blackburn but aside from one chance he showed a lack of match fitness . LIVERPOOL: (4-2-3-1) Mignolet 7.5 . Recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Save from Marshall on to the post in key moment. Simon Mignolet recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Saved from Marshall in key moment . Johnson 6 . Played on the right of a back four. Natural role for him and found chances to go forward but left gaps at times. Sakho 5.5 . Struggled from the start, looking uncomfortable on the ball and he picked up a hamstring problem. Substituted after losing out to Rhodes. Lovren 6.5 . Good return to the side, albeit against lower league opposition. Team selection on Saturday indicated he was fifth choice but Anfield career not necessarily over. Moreno 6 . Comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do. Alberto Moreno had a comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do . Lucas 6 . Provided a solid base in midfield and moved the ball around well but not much penetration as Liverpool toiled in first half. Allen 5.5 . Similar to Lucas, couldn't provide impetus where it was needed, though. May have handled in own area and later appeared to go down easily for late penalty shout. Coutinho 8 . The star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley. Clever move to find way to break Blackburn down. Philippe Coutinho was the star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley . Henderson 6.5 . His one-two with Coutinho set up the winner but his deliveries from dead-balls left much to be required at times. Sterling 6.5 . One of Liverpool's main threats as usual, playing down the left at Ewood Park. Impact blunted as Blackburn doubled up. Booked. Sturridge 5 . He's not back at his best yet and it showed. Seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times and was restricted to shots from distance. Daniel Sturridge is not back at his best yet and it showed. He seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times . Subs . Toure 7.5 (for Sakho 26) Solid in defence with Lovren, he ably deputised when Liverpool had to reshuffle early on and dealt with Gestede and Rhodes. Lambert (for Sturridge 85) No time. Headed first touch wide. REFEREE: . Kevin Friend 7 . Did all that could be expected of him. Missed Allen handball shout after Ben Marshall's header but that would have been harsh. Ignored penalty shout from same player in stoppage time. MAN OF THE MATCH: . Philippe Coutinho . A mercurial performance topped off with an excellent goal to decide the game. He knows how to make the difference in big moments for his club and Liverpool benefited from that again. Coutinho's shot finds the corner to decide the game at Ewood Park after a lack of clear-cut chances .",

There is a tall glass of something very red and rather alarming on the kitchen counter when I meet Kathryn Beale at her three-bedroom home in Swindon. More scary still, she appears to be drinking it. Fortunately it soon becomes clear that my suspicions are unwarranted, as the substance in the tumbler is nothing more troubling than plain old fruit juice. But I am here because Kathryn is a national expert in the art of the strange foodstuff, and one very disconcerting product in particular. The 41-year-old mother-of-two is part of a rapidly growing cottage industry that prepares fresh placenta for new mothers. Along with some 60 other specialists in this country, she whizzes it into smoothies, or grinds it into pills for women convinced of its health benefits. Mothers have reported powerful healing properties, saying that eating their own placenta (the blood-filled organ that supports the foetus in the womb) has helped to increase their milk supply, reduce post-natal bleeding, stabilise blood pressure, and, crucially, provide them with more energy to care for their babies. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Hollywood actresses January Jones and Alicia Silverstone and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton. Kathryn has had no reported cases of food poisoning among her clients. Nor, for that matter, has any other practitioner in the 70-strong Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network (IPEN), of which Kathryn is a member. IPEN estimates that between 4,000 and 5,000 women have used the service since it started in 2010, the majority in Britain. Yet Kathryn is in despair, having found herself at the centre of a storm which could not only destroy her own business, but help put an end to placenta-eating across the country. Scroll down for video . Natural: Kathryn Beale\u00a0whizzes plcenta into smoothies or into pills for women convinced of its health benefits . Swindon Council is claiming that her services pose a danger to the mothers she is trying to help, and are taking her to court saying they want to stop her from trading. They have already taken half her essential kit, including a grinder and a pill-maker, meaning she can no longer provide her service. She said: \u2018It does seem like a witch-hunt. Why should they be doing everything they can to stop me providing a service which I believe helps new mothers? Yes, some people might be squeamish about it, but that doesn\u2019t give the council the right to just close me down.\u2019 IPEN director Lynnea Shrief lost her court battle against Dacorum Council in Hertfordshire last year. She believes the legal action is part of a national move to shut down the industry. Three other IPEN businesses have also faced opposition from local authorities. Benefits: Mothers say eating placenta has helped to increase their milk supply and reduce post-natal bleeding. Pictured: Placenta capsules . It was in March that the council took action against Kathryn. Health bosses claimed that dangerous microbes would multiply while the placenta was being processed in her kitchen \u2013 with the risk of poisoning the mother. Last month, Swindon failed to convince a magistrate to grant a hygiene emergency prohibition order against Kathryn, who contested the order. Despite noting her various food-safety certificates, and failing to advise how she might satisfy their health risk concerns, the council is trying again and she will re-appear in court in May. Kathryn says of the council\u2019s inspection: \u2018It was clear they didn\u2019t know how a maternity ward works. They had the impression that placentas were just falling out of women all over the floor and being put into buckets with other placentas. It\u2019s just not the case.\u2019 Kathryn provides her clients \u2013 mostly well-educated, professional women \u2013 with a large zip-lock bag into which the placenta is placed. The bagged organ is then put into a large leak-proof plastic box, which goes into a cool bag packed with ice packs ready for Kathryn to collect. Celebrities who have eaten their own placentas include Mad Men star January Jones (left) and Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton (right) If the mother has requested a \u00a320 placenta smoothie at the birth, Kathryn blends some with fruit and apple juice using a hand-held blender. She takes the remainder home and either steams the organ with lemon, ginger and green chilli, or dries slices of placenta in a dehydrator before grinding the pieces into a powder which she makes into capsules. This service costs \u00a3150. Kathryn, a former primary school teacher turned birth \u2018doula\u2019 \u2013 a non-medical supporter for expectant mothers \u2013 became interested in placenta consumption after watching chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall flambee one on TV. She added placenta processing to her birth doula business in March 2013 after a day-long IPEN training course. She obtained certificates in food safety for manufacturing, infection control, and HACCP, a food safety management system. A Swindon Council spokesman said: \u2018Preparation of foodstuffs using human placenta in this way can present a number of potentially serious health risks to those who consume them. We are legally obliged to investigate and take whatever steps are necessary to protect consumers.\u2019 A key genetic mutation could explain why some children who catch flu are left fighting for their lives in hospital \u2013 while others just need a day or two in bed. Scientists discovered the mutation after studying a two-year-old French girl who nearly died from the flu. They found she was particularly vulnerable because she had inherited a rare double genetic mutation from both of her parents which meant she was unable to produce a protein called interferon. Interferon, which is commercially available, helps the immune system attack flu and could now be used to save young victims. Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova, from the Imagine Institute of Genetic Diseases in Paris, and the St Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Disease at Rockefeller University in the US, said: \u2018This finding suggests that one could treat severe childhood flu with interferon.\u2019 The girl, who was critically ill with flu in 2011, has not had the virus since, after being vaccinated annually. The researchers\u2019 findings have been published in the journal Science.",

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled\u00a01,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits,\u00a0indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there\u2019s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia\u00a0there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you\u2019re allergic to dust mites you basically can\u2019t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings\u2019 or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body\u2019s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They\u2019re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a\u00a0humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It\u2019s because your dog\u2019s hair has allergens on it \u2013 left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too \u2013 forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.",

Police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. Tuesday. \"After developing information that George Davon Kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape, BCSO Investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest,\" according to a news release. Investigators discovered that Kennedy had family in DeKalb County, Georgia, and reached out to the sheriff's office there. Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said. Kennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said. Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said. Troy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been \"placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team.\" Martistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf. The arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched. The woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities. It's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say. Four young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for. \"There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on,\" McKeithen said. \"And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County.\" Authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. Authorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. She \"does not remember the assault at all,\" Corley said. \"She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged.\" (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.) She was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. \"You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted.\" The suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said. Authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said. The sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released. While the video is \"one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach,\" it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said. \"This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered.\" Corley said that through social media, \"we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around.\" About 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.",

Annegret Raunigk, 65, was plunged into a vortex of travel and trials thanks to the wish of daughter Leila, who turns ten this year, but says she is not bothered about what people say about her decision to have more children so late in life. Their scheduled births for the schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin,\u00a0is just weeks away - but there are major fears that the health risks for her unborn quads will spike massively if they are induced early. Babies on the way: Annegret Raunigk, 65, and her nine-year-old daughter Leila are seen during a recent ultrasound filmed for an upcoming documentary about how the teacher is preparing to welcome the quads . Annegret, meanwhile, is weathering the debate centred on the rights or wrongs of her decision to both become pregnant and raise the children with cool detachment. 'There will obviously be cliches bandied about,' she said, 'and I find that quite strenuous. But I have always been a person who says live and let live and it is not for the opinion of others but for me. 'I have enough experience of childbirth not to be afraid. I am not scared actually, I am just hoping to stay healthy and fit. If others are mega-prim about this I believe they have no interesting lives themselves and therefore it no longer bothers me. I think this is the right choice.' 'She is a very strong, very fit woman,' Her doctor, Kai Hertwig tells MailOnline. 'I hope she can come to full term, I think she can. She is very well placed to be a fit mother for these babies. The schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin, is set to become the world's oldest woman to give birth to quads . Ms Raunigk and her large brood are seen during an appearance on German television in 2005 . 'The pregnancy so far makes no distinction between the body of a younger or older person but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high burden. 'We of course are keeping a close watch on the cardiovascular system. We all have little or no experience with such a pregnant woman in this age group, but I can say that this is certainly going very well.' Thrombosis, her heart, her circulatory system - these are the areas causing concern for the unborns in the run-up to delivery day. 'But she is highly motivated and this positive psychological mood is optimally important, the rest is not in our hands,' added her gynaecologist. Both were speaking in a clip released by the RTL TV network which is airing her story on Monday night. One woman who had a child at 42 tells the programme: 'I met her and found her to be a very sympathetic and intelligent woman. 'As a 56-year-old woman who raised a just-pubescent son, it is hard to imagine why she would want to have quads. I also wonder how she can meet the needs of her growing children, especially as the children will have no father.' It was mentioned in the publicity clip released by RTL that her fertility treatment - including both donated eggs and donated sperm - would never have been greenlighted in Germany. Two countries where treatment for women of such an advanced age is allowed were stated as Ukraine and America. All her 13 children, ranging from Leila to a daughter of 44, were sired by five different fathers.",

But there is another form of the deadly gas, dubbed abiotic methane, that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor. Now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor . The reservoirs are secure, and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change. Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane, that can later be used as fuel. One reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge, in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'This ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the Arctic environment is ideal for this type of methane production,' said Joel Johnson associate professor at the University of New Hampshire. The Center for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Climate and Environment (Cage) estimates that up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of hydrates in the ocean floor. Scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\u00a0One such reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge (pictured), in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'But this estimate is not accounting for abiotic methane. So there is probably much more,' said Cage director J\u00fcrgen Mienert. Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. However, methane is also the principle component in natural gas.\u00a0It is a lucrative fuel source, which could contain more energy than all the world's oil, coal and gas put together. They believe the gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. 'Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor,' said Johnson. 'These only form in slow to ultraslow spreading seafloor crust. The optimal temperature range for serpentinisation of ocean crust is 200 \u2013 350 degrees Celsius.' Methane produced by serpentinisation can escape through cracks and faults, and end up at the ocean floor, causing a concern for future global warming. But in the Knipovich Ridge it is trapped as gas hydrate in the sediments. 'In other known settings the abiotic methane escapes into the ocean, where it potentially influences ocean chemistry,' says Johnson. 'But if the pressure is high enough, and the subsea floor temperature is cold enough, the gas gets trapped in a hydrate structure below the sea floor.' B\u00fcnz says that there are many places in the Arctic Ocean with a similar tectonic setting as the Knipovich ridge. Rather than causing a concern, the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long-term storage of methane carbon in deep-marine sediments. But other types of methane in the Arctic are causing a concern for scientists. Last year Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He tweeted: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane \u2013 which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Samples of the gas hydrates will provide more knowledge on abiotic methane. But they need to be drilled, as they are 140 metres under the ocean floor .",

These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about \"100 Days of Rejection\", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. \"I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,\" explained Jiang. The project started out to help \"fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,\" he said. \"The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection.\" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. \"My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle.\" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you: . 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

The Oxford crew were training on the Thames for the\u00a0Boat Race which \u00a0takes place on Saturday, April 11 . The RNLI revealed the conditions were caused by strong wind against the tide creating three successive waves that poured over the boat's riggers, 'creating an influx of water that could not be managed by the craft's bilge pump'. In a statement RNLI helmsman Ian Owen said: 'While we have rescued quite a number of rowers over the years, this is the first time I've been involved in helping such a prestigious team. 'The weather can be unpredictable on the Thames, and the Oxford University team dealt with the situation as safely and calmly as possible. We wish them all the best for their upcoming race.' Chiswick and Tower stations are the busiest in the country, and the RNLI has saved over 3,600 people since the service began in 2002.

The England international will be absent once again on Saturday at The Hawthorns, as he continues to be plagued by a hip problem and Rodgers admitted he is \u201cunsure\u201d as to whether Sturridge will play for Liverpool again this season. It has been a nightmare year for Liverpool in terms of goals. They had 88 after 32 matches last season but now, at the same stage, their total is 47 and not one of their players feature in the top 25 leading scorers in the Barclays Premier League. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is in danger of falling down the pecking order due to his poor injury record . Sturridge (left, pictured with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard) has played just 12 league games this season . England international Sturridge has been hampered by injuries during the course of the campaign . Sturridge has also endured a nightmare campaign. He missed five months due to calf and thigh issues and has struggled for consistency in the games he has managed to play. His length of time out has been extreme but history shows absences are not uncommon in his career. If Liverpool are to get back to where Rodgers wants them to be, they need goals. Divock Origi will arrive this summer, while they are trying to sign Danny Ings from Burnley and have registered a firm interest in PSV Eindhoven\u2019s Memphis Depay. But they are not going to be the peak of Liverpool\u2019s ambitions and Rodgers is searching for a proven attacker who will be able to call on consistently. When asked how many strikers he wanted to sign, Rodgers said: \u2018I\u2019m not sure but I need one that is going to be playing at a top level every week. It can make a huge difference. If you look at teams who are successful they have that \u2013 a consistent striker. \u2018What that gives the rest of team is crucial. You saw it here with Suarez, the impact that kind of striker can have. But it is something that is not easy to find. We have to find a way to attract them here. We will fight hard to do in the summer. We are on course to be 60 goals down on last year.\u2019 Sturridge picked up this latest injury on March 22 against Manchester United. England manager Roy Hodgson described it as \u201ca small tear\u201d after he was ruled out of games against Lithuania and Italy and it was a source of frustration to Liverpool that he missed last Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final. Liverpool boss Rodgers is keen on signing Burnley striker Danny Ings (left) and PSV's Memphis Depay (right) Belgium striker Divock Origi, pictured during his loan spell at Lille, will return to Liverpool in the summer . Rodgers was asked if he felt the stage had been reached where he no longer considers Sturridge to be his first choice striker and he said: \u2018Listen, that\u2019s entirely for you to write. He\u2019s not fit and once he can show that consistency and fitness, you can see in his performance level that it\u2019s a high one. \u2018But he has missed lot of the season, so we need to assess it. Either way if he\u2019 s not available, we need to have that support. There always is that risk with those type of players, with their speed and body type, but we have to hope with Daniel this year was just an unlucky season. \u2018We hope he can come back super-fit and super-strong because he has an immense talent. You can\u2019t argue with that \u2013 he can be as good as any striker in the world with his talent.\u2019",

Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric\u00a0told Inside Edition:\u00a0'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy\u00a0was on hand to\u00a0film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son,\u00a0who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It\u2019s very black and white. There\u2019s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don\u2019t have emotions, but they do. It\u2019s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'",

'I'm totally not as ready for the claycourt season as I thought I was. Now I'm in the mindset of, 'You know what, I'm not on hard court.' I'm playing like I'm on hard court and I'm not,' said Williams afterwards. 'So I have to play and be ready to hit a thousand shots if necessary.' Meanwhile, the Stuttgart event could decide who is ranked second in the world with Simona Halep close to overtaking Sharapova in the WTA list.

The unusual transparency has been caused by surface ice melting, unveiling the boat graveyard at the bottom of the Great Lake, before organisms like plankton conceal them once more. The soul-stirring images were snapped during a routine helicopter patrol by the U.S. Coast Guard, who had a perfect view of normally obscured wreckage in an area where many ships foundered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Scroll down for video . Revealed:\u00a0The 121-foot brig of the James McBride, which ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857, has been revealed following ice-melt in Lake Michigan . Rising Sun: The 133 foot long wooden steamer stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, and can be seen on the bottom of the Great Lake . Glory days: The Rising Sun was owned by a religious group called the House of David when it crashed in October 1917. Members of the group were returning from High Island, where they spend the summer, when it crashed in a sudden snowstorm . Graveyard: The above map shows the Manitou Passage of Lake Michigan, which is home to dozens of shipwrecks due to the unpredictable weather on the lake. The wrecks of the James McBride and Rising Sun were exposed this month after ice melted on the lake . Unpredictable weather makes Lake Michigan home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world with sudden storms, fire, and fog causing the destruction of these many thousands of vessels over the years. The pictures are taken of the shallow waters of the lake off the Leelanau Peninsula near Leland, known as the Manitou Passage, between the mainland of the northwestern Lower Peninsula and North and South Manitou Islands. This area alone is home to dozens of shipwrecks, most which were grounded shipping lumber at the turn of the 20th century. The Coast Guard wasn\u2019t immediately able to identify the wrecks, but with help from fans on Facebook, they learned that two of them are the James McBride and the Rising Sun. The 121-foot brig James McBride ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857. Her remains now lie in 15 feet of water near Sleeping Bear Point. The James McBride is believed to be the first ship to haul cargo from the West Indies all the way back to Chicago, when it completed a trip to Turk Island for salt in 1848, stopping at Nova Scotia on the way back for cod. Eerie: This unknown wreck was captured by the US Coast Guard from a helicopter during a routine patrol over the Great Lake . Rare sightings: Two wrecks can just be seen (top left and bottom right of picture) through the clear waters of Lake Michigan . Stunning scenery: A house can be seen on the edge of the lake which endures unpredictable weather and is home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world . It launched on April fool\u2019s day in 1848 and sank nine years later after carrying a cargo of wood from the Manitou Islands. The Rising Sun was a 133-foot-long wooden steamer which stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, because of an early snow storm. Lifeboats were scrambled and all 32 people on board were saved but she went to pieces. Her wreckage now rests in about 12 feet of water. The Rising Sun was actually first named the Minnie M, but it was renamed the Rising Sun when it was purchased by a religious group called the House of David in 1913. The commune was founded by Benjamin and Mary Purnell in Benton Harbor, Michigan in 1903. Benjamin claimed to be the younger brother of Jesus, and his group of about 900 followers called him King Ben. During the summer, the group lived on High Island - located about thirty miles northwest of Charlevoix, Michigan. In October 1917, Captain Charles Morrison was taking  passengers and crew members from the group back to Benton Harbor where they would spend the winter when a sudden snowstorm hit. The captain tried to make Charlevoix, but the ship pushed west into the Manitou Passage where it crashed into a set of submerged boulders. Everyone on board survived the crash, escaping on two sets of lifeboats. Protected: The wrecks of the stricken vessels are protected by law to stop divers trying to salvage anything from the sunken history . The U.S Park Service, which manages the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, announced last month that the wreckage of the Jennie & Annie was now visible again on the beach halfway between North and South Bar lakes. The schooner grounded off Empire in 1872 and is visible every few years. Beach erosion, waves, wind and variable water levels in the lake cause the wrecks to periodically become visible along the dunes shoreline. Since the shipwrecks are considered public property, they are not allowed to be disturbed. However, divers are allowed to explore the wrecks in warmer weather.

Trott, who looks sure to open with Alastair Cook in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday, fell for just two, top-edging an attempted pull against a St Kitts side bolstered by England bowlers Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood. It follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his England team-mate Jimmy Anderson but Trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in St Kitts ahead of the main business next week. Jonathan Trott failed twice with the bat during England's warm-up for the first Test in Basseterre . Trott is dismissed by his England team-mate James Anderson in St Kitts . Trott\u2019s only rival for the opener slot, Yorkshire\u2019s Adam Lyth, was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but Alastair Cook and Ian Bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match. England gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first Test as their low-key warm-up week meandered to a close. Their four days of cricket  have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action. Trott looks set to open the batting with Alastair Cook in Antigua in the first Test next week . England completed four days of low-key, uncompetitive warm-up action in Basseterre on Thursday . Alastair Cook . Jonathan Trott . Gary Ballance . Ian Bell . Joe Root . Ben Stokes . Jos Buttler . Chris Jordan . Stuart Broad . James Tredwell . Jimmy Anderson . The decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow Chris Jordan and James Tredwell to face some admittedly low-quality bowling, suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team. Barring a raging turner in Antigua next week there will be only one spinning place and Tredwell, already a likelier pick than Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit. His dismissal gave Rashid a chance of his own but Tredwell was given priority and can now start preparing for a second Test cap. Jordan, meanwhile, was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session, when England pressed for an extra half-hour's play following rain delays. That suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett, who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case. Captain Cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on Thursday . Ian Bell looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired . England will leave St Kitts and head to Antigua for the first Test against the West Indies on Monday . Those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill, with Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side, while Gary Ballance, Trott and Root featured for both teams at various points. Bell looked in best form, making a fluent 43 before retiring, while captain Cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session.",

Kate, 33, is due to give birth to her second child in the coming days - providing a little brother or sister to Prince George. William's wife already has a nanny at her disposal as well as her mother Carole, who is moving into the Cambridges' Norfolk home Anmer Hall after the new baby arrives. Scroll down for video . Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George poses for photographers outside St. Mary's Hospital in London shortly after giving birth in 2013. She is currently preparing to give birth to her second child . So just how difficult is it to care for a newborn with a toddler running around? Very, as it turns out. Parenting blogger Emily-Jane Clark, who runs the popular site\u00a0How To Survive A Sleep Thief, which she describes as 'an antithesis to baby advice', has compiled a list of the ways that a mother can cope with caring for two kids under two. They including avoiding a double buggy, buying several blue bowls and never setting a specific time for meeting people. Read on to catch some of Emily's top tips... Having two children is significantly harder than having one, according to the experts (picture posed by models) 1. Do not bother trying to get anything done ever. While it is tricky to get stuff done with one baby, with two it is practically impossible. I have lost entire days trying to get things done and achieved nothing. You think, 'I know; I\u2019ll write a list, get organised, tick things off as I go along.' Easy, right? Wrong. Five days later you realise you haven\u2019t even managed to finish writing the bloody list. So I suggest doing what you can when you can. Better still just use this list: . Get up.\u00a0Look after the children. Anything achieved alongside this list is automatically a bonus. 2. Don\u2019t buy a double buggy. You will use it once, realise it is really heavy and annoying and sell it on Ebay. 3. Do not try to get anywhere on time. With two babies on the go, everything takes ages. \u2018Popping out\u2019 becomes a distant memory. I remember a time when nipping out for milk simply meant taking clothes out of the wardrobe, putting them on, grabbing my bag and leaving the house. Now it can take hours as I desperately attempt to scrub baby snot from my clothes with baby wipes, clean bums, clean teeth, change nappies, feed baby, break up fights, chase toddler, dress toddler, dress baby, leave house, forget bag, return to house, leave house, forget baby, return to house, get baby, leave house and then when I finally get to shop, I have forgotten what the hell I went for. As a mother of two young children, it is almost impossible to get anywhere on time (picture posed by models) 4. Someone always wants something from you. A banana, a biscuit, a drink, a dummy, a poo, a wee, a wipe, dinner, lunch, breakfast, a snack, toys, clothes. Take me outside, take me home, take me to the toilet, take me to the park? Story, piggyback, Play Doh, song. Your life becomes an endless cycle of getting stuff for small people. Some days you\u2019ll want to quit. Other days you\u2019ll want to scream. But you still get them the stuff. Because at the end of the day, it is far easier than being asked for the stuff, over and over again, ALL DAY LONG. 5. When you are expecting your second baby you will secretly worry whether you will love him or her as much as you love your first. Surely, it must be impossible to love another human being as much as you love your firstborn? There could never be a baby as cute, or as funny, or as beautiful. Then baby two arrives and they are just as cute, just as funny and just as beautiful. And before you know it, you can\u2019t imagine life without them. When children are young, they always want whatever toy the other is playing with (picture posed by models) 6. Get an extra pair of eyes to put in the back of your head because, at one point, your children will try to kill each other. Not intentionally, of course. But toddlers seem to be under the impression that \u2018dangerous\u2019 means fun. For example; 'It will be so funny to whack my sister over the head with a mug.' And 'I wonder what will happen if I stick this pencil right up my sister\u2019s nose.' 7. Buy two of everything. They always want what the other one has.

The Wolves boss believes it is now just the top eight in the Sky Bet Championship who are fighting it out for the play-off places, with their 2-1 success at the City Ground all but ending the Reds' chances of making a late push. Wolves were fired on by a goal just 30 seconds into the second half from Benik Afobe, followed by a Bakary Sako penalty in the 72nd minute. Dexter Blackstock pulled one back for Forest four minutes into injury time, but it was too little, too late. Bakary Sako celebrates after scoring Wolves' second goal in a 2-1 win at Nottingham Forest on Good Friday . Manager Kenny Jackett has told his side that they need to keep their focus to maintain a promotion push . And Jackett does not want Wolves to let their promotion push slip away now, saying: We just need to keep winning our games and not worry about other sides. It looks like the top eight will be involved now, although I don't know if Forest will have an opinion on that. 'We have to follow this win up with another against Leeds now, there will be a big crowd at Molineux and we have to focus on that now. 'The mood is very determined, there is good focus among the players and we are keen to keep improving.' Jackett was particularly delighted for Afobe, who he had previously taken on loan at Millwall, saying: 'He is repaying our faith but we worked together at Millwall and I am delighted to have him permanently now. He was ready for a permanent home. Dougie Freedman believes the difference between the two sides was a simple composure in front of goal . 'I'm delighted to have won. I felt that Forest put us under a lot of pressure in the first 20 minutes, a lot of energy, the crowd were right behind them. We defended well in that period, very well. Then we came through it and started to look a threat ourselves. 'Then just after half time, Afobe's scored a fantastic goal that, in a tight game, has put our noses in front. After that we were very professional, we got the second goal, we needed it and it was a good overall performance.' Forest boss Dougie Freedman says the difference between the two sides was simple composure in front of goal. Wolves striker Afobe (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after putting them ahead in the second half . 'The difference was that they took their chances when they came along. There was not a lot in it, they just took their chances when they came their way,' he said. 'When they scored just after half time, our team talk went out the window. But you have to take your chances against the top sides and we had plenty of them. 'The ability to take chances is what cost us in the end. They took theirs and we did not make the most of ours. Afobe made the difference, because he took his goal superbly. 'We had opportunities to win the game, we had sustained pressure on their goal. But we did not have the cutting edge we needed.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe title race appears to be over, but what about the fight to stay in the Premier League? No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It\u2019s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season . Seven points split Sunderland in 15th and Leicester in 20th as the battle for Premier League survival heats up . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Crystal Palace (H) -D . Stoke (A) - D . Southampton (H) - L . Everton (A) - L . Leicester (H) - W . Arsenal (A) - L . Chelsea (A) L . Predicted total: 34 points . Verdict: Safe . Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for. They need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it\u2019s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Aston Villa . Position: 16th on 29 points . Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . Tim Sherwood has helped Villa rediscover their scoring touch since replacing Paul Lambert as manager . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester City (A) - L . Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points . Steve Bruce's Hull  are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining . Ahmed Elmohamady will be a key man in Hull's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Southampton (A) - L . Liverpool (H) - D . Crystal Palace (A) - D . Arsenal (H) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester United (H) - L . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Safe. On goal difference. The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR\u2019s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in . Chris Ramsey may find QPR's goal difference a big disadvantage, particularly with a tough final seven games . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Chelsea (H) - L . West Ham (H) - W . Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City \u2013 games you would expect them to lose anywhere \u2013 are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull\u2019s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points . Danny Ings will spearhead Burnley's attack as they attempt to escape the Premier League relegation zone . Sean Dyche's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against Hull and Villa . Predicted results: Six points from seven games . Arsenal (H) \u2013 L . Everton (A) - D . Leicester (H) \u2013 W . West Ham (A) - D . Hull (A) - L . Stoke (H) - D . Aston Villa (A) - L . Predicted total: 32 points . Verdict: Relegated . On paper they probably have the most straightforward opponents, but have the misfortune of playing two of their most critical fixtures \u2013 against Hull and Villa \u2013 away from Turf Moor. They have won only once away all season so it would be extremely ambitious to expect them to make hay now, considering four of those seven fixtures are on the road. Would expect their status to be decided by the final two games. Leicester . Position: 20th on 22 points . Esteban Cambiasso celebrates after an impressive display helped Leicester beat West Ham 2-1 on Saturday . Nigel Pearson (left) has eight games remaining to get Leicester safe and has five home games to play . Predicted results: Four points from eight games . West Brom (A) - L . Swansea (H) - D . Burnley (A) - L . Chelsea (H) - L . Newcastle (H) - D . Southampton (H) - D . Sunderland (A) - L . QPR (H) - D . Predicted total: 26 points . Verdict: Relegated . As with Burnley, it\u2019s not the most intimidating run-in and they do have the most games from which to gain points. They also have the slight advantage of five fixtures at home. But 22 points from 30 games so far offers little indication that they will mount any kind of sprint for the line.",

Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly joined Michelle to surprise the crowd,and opened the broadcast with a gospel medley that included the song 'Alpha & Omega' and the hit single 'Say Yes' from Michelle's 'Journey To Freedom' CD. The group received a rousing standing ovation from the 9,000-plus crowd, but they weren't introduced as Destiny's child - they were introduced by their individual names. Scroll down for video . Nameless: Singers Michelle Williams, Kelly Rowland and Beyonce performing \"Say Yes\" during the 30th Annual Stellar Awards in Las Vegas last week. The singers did not refer to themselves as Destiny's Child . Touchdown: Destiny's Child perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show in 2013 . Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively that the threesome want to do another ten-year reunion tour and intend to cut a reunion album - but they won't use the group name for that either. And it's all by design. 'Alhough Destiny's Child is made up of the three ladies, Beyonc\u00e9's father and former manager Mathew Knowles owns one-fourth of the group as well. Anytime they do anything under the name Destiny's Child, he has involvement in it and money from it,' a source close to the group reveals to Daily Mail Online. None of the members of Destiny's Child want any involvement with Mathew, who once managed each of their individual careers as well as the group. Kelly was first to fire him in 2009, Michelle followed in 2010 and Beyonc\u00e9 finally nixed all dealings with her dad after accusations of stealing money from her in 2011. Mathew's marriage to Beyonc\u00e9's mother Tina Knowles ended after it surfaced he had gotten a woman named Alexsandra Wright pregnant. Once she gave birth to their son Nixon, Tina filed for divorce. In 2014, it was revealed that Mathew fathered a second child, a four-year-old daughter named Koi. 'That it was claimed Mathew stole money from Beyonc\u00e9 and then he sued to prove that he didn't was bad enough. But all of the extramarital affairs and children outside the marriage just made it so that Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't have anything to do with her dad at all,' the source explained. Before the split: Destiny's Child and Matthew Knowles pose for a portrait October 30, 2000 in Houston . In late 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary, 'Beyonc\u00e9: Life Is But a Dream.' But after \u00a0that, says the source, she stopped communicating with him again and his only access to her is via her assistant's work email address. The trio's unwillingness to deal with Mathew is why they keep putting off a Destiny's Child reunion album and tour. Their 2005 Destiny Fulfilled tour grossed approximately $70.8 million in the U.S. alone and according to Billboard it was the highest-grossing tour for either a pop or R&B band since TLC's FanMail Tour. Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly and Michelle wanted to record a 10-year follow-up CD and launch a tour. They know both the album and tour could a huge seller and break tour records. 'The problem is they can't figure out how to nix Mathew from the deal. They all want more than anything to give the fans one last run of the group, especially since they all have their own individual success, but don't want to deal with Mathew,' the source explained. It's unlikely that Mathew would allow the women to cut any deals without him. His financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month. Destiny's Child first album debuted in \u00a01998 . In late 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary. But after that, says the source, she stopped communicating . Last December photos emerged of a huge garage sale he was having in Houston, where selling both Beyonc\u00e9 and old Destiny's Child memorabilia to raise money. 'At best they maybe could offer him a flat rate or one-time settlement to buy out his portion of the group, but otherwise we may never get a Destiny's Child reunion because none of them want him to benefit financially,' the source concluded. Destiny's Child made their debut in 1998 with their self-titled release. The group then consisted of Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. In 1999, Mathew kicked out LaTavia and LeToya and replaced them with Michelle and a short-lived member Farrah Franklin (she barely lasted three months) before settling in as a trio. They would release four additional albums; win three Grammy Awards and go on to sell more than 60 million records worldwide. Mathew Knowles financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month .

Giant Beyonce posters sold \u00a0for $200 . T-shirts for sale: . After their breakup in 2005, Beyonc\u00e9 became an international pop star with five solo albums releases and 17 Grammy wins.

Tewksbury Police Department came under  attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects  through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the\u00a0Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files.\u00a0Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S. Similar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier. Police in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.",

Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 . 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video . The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 . Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National . Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding.\u00a0And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to \u00a310,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household. Waley-Cohen is a Celebrity Ambassador for The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) and was famously pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge at the Roller Disco he organised to raise money for a ward in memory of his brother.",

He was sentenced by Judge Noel Lucas (above) at Guildford Crown Court . A chartered surveyor who assaulted his 92-year-old mother at her house while her live-in carer was out has been spared jail. Timothy Norris-Jones, who had previously attacked his mother on two occasions, left her with bruises on her face and a cut on her right wrist that needed stitches, a court heard. The 59-year-old told police the injuries were caused when she fell and said he had accidentally 'caught her face' when he went to catch her in November last year. He was arrested after the victim's carer returned home and called the police. His mother later told detectives: 'He just blew up. 'He was pushing my face and holding my wrists. I can remember I said: \"Stop this Tim, don't do it\".' Norris-Jones was handed a restraining order banning him from spending any time alone with his mother for the rest of her life and from visiting her house in Guildford, Surrey. A forensic psychologist told the court that emotionally damaged Norris-Jones looked to his mother for support and 'lost his rag' when she could not provide it. Judge Noel Lucas, sentencing, branded the attack 'horrific' and added: 'It is pretty unforgivable to strike an elderly lady.' He said: 'You gave your mother a systematic beating. 'If I had taken the view that your actions were anything other than those of an ill and weak man, I would now be sending you to prison for a substantial amount of time.'

'One of the reasons this is not only sad, but a difficult case, is that we can't confidently say why this happened. 'The defendant is unable to explain what triggered this or the previous assaults.' Norris-Jones was handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, at Guildford Crown Court (above) and will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet enforcing a strict 12-month curfew . Norris-Jones, from Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, admitted two counts of ABH and was cleared of one count of GBH when he appeared at Guildford Crown Court. He was handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and will have to wear an electronic ankle bracelet enforcing a strict 12-month curfew. He was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 costs.",

Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the   2013 marathon, today opposed the death penalty as a means of punishment for their attacker, urging others to 'overcome the impulse for vengeance.' The couple's statement of compassion follows a similar appeal made by the family of an eight-year-old boy, Martin Richard, who was killed in the blast. His seven-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. This week, after finding Tsaernaev guilty on all 30 counts related to the April 15, 2013, attack, a jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison without parole. 'We must overcome the impulse for vengeance': Married couple Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes have joined the appeals calling for Dzhokar Tsarnaev to be sentenced to life in prison rather than death . Emotional: The couple who lost a leg each in the blast said their position is highly emotional and practical . Moving on: Here they are pictured completing the Boston Marathon in wheelchairs on the one-year anniversary . In a statement to The Boston Globe, Kensky and Downes said: 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance.' They call their position 'intensely emotional and profoundly practical.' The victims aren't the first to speak out against the death penalty in Tsarnaev's high-profile trial. The Boston Globe editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Tsarnaev should 'die in prison'. Like the Richards, Kensky and Downes call for life in prison without parole or appeals to ensure Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible.' The Richards made their appeal in a moving op-ed for the Boston Globe, published last Tuesday, just a day after the two-year anniversary of their son Martin's death. While the Richards say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their 'tireless and committed' work to bring justice, they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21-year-old to jail for the rest of his life. No to execution: The family of bombing victim Martin Richard wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe, saying they oppose the death penalty for terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The family is pictured on the two-year anniversary of the attack. Clockwise from top left: Denise Richard, Bill Richard, Henry Richard and Jane Richard . Moments before: Martin Richard is seen circled in blue on the day of the Marathon. Behind him walks Tsarnaev, carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs . Brothers: Tsarnaev's (right) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his extreme older brother Tamerlan (left). \u00a0Tamerlan died a few days after the bombing in a shootout with police . 'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives,' the Richards wrote. 'We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.' They say sentencing Tsarnaev to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims. Victim: Martin Richard died at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 . 'As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours. 'The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family,' they wrote. The Richards brought their three kids out to watch the Marathon two years ago, and were standing just steps away from where Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan (who died in a shootout with police a few days later) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs. Little Martin died in the blasts and his sister Jane lost a leg. During the course of Tsarnaev's trial, photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack, strolling just behind the Richard family lined up against a gate at the finish line. On the day the op-ed was published, the Richard family revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial. The family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony. The death penalty is outlawed in Massachusetts, where the trial is taking place, but since Tsarnaev is being judged in federal court, execution is still a sentencing option. However, experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison, considering the state's generally liberally view on the controversial issue. Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney is Judy Clarke, a woman who specializes in helping high-profile clients like the Unabomber escape the death penalty. Clarke and the rest of Tsarnaev's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother's terrorist plot.

With France international Lloris sidelined by a knee injury, Dutchman Vorm will stand in at Turf Moor. The 31-year-old, signed from Swansea in the summer, had to watch on from the bench at Wembley against Chelsea in last month's League Cup final defeat, despite having featured in the earlier rounds. Michel Vorm is set to deputise in place of Hugo Lloris when Tottenham play Burnley on Sunday . Lloris sustained a knee injury in Tottenham's 4-3 victory over Leicester in the Premier League . Mauricio Pochettino has praised Vorm's attitude despite being behind Lloris in the pecking order . Pochettino, however, has every confidence Vorm can produced the required performance when thrown back into the action against the Clarets. 'Michel took it very well. I have no worries about him. He is a good professional and he is fine,' the Argentinian said. 'It is always it is difficult and it was the same with the other players who were left out. 'I was sorry for him, but also for the players who were on the bench or out of the squad. It is always difficult when you play a final and you have to choose the starting 11.' Pochettino has been impressed by Vorm's mentality, having left a regular starting place at Swansea to play back-up to Lloris. 'When I spoke with him about signing, he knew - I never lied to him. I told him our proposal and were very clear,' the Spurs boss said. Vorm (centre) played in all of the Capital One Cup games for Tottenham except the final . Pochettino (left) will again take on Burnley manager Sean Dyche at Turf Moor on Sunday . Tottenham head to Burnley in some positive form, having lost just once in the last four Barclays Premier League matches before the international break - and that at Manchester United. Pochettino, though, knows a solid collective defensive performance will be key against a side battling for their top-flight survival. 'We need to concede fewer chances and goals, but this is not about the keeper or the centre-back or the full-back or the holding midfielder - this is about the balance of the team,' he said.",

The men were part of a group of five divers from the East Coast and San Francisco. Ten friends, including the dead men, had rented a house on Caspar Cove 160 miles north of San Francisco to hunt for abalone, a rare and expensive mollusk that is prized as a delicacy. The Santa Rosa Press Democrat\u00a0reports that the accident in Mendocino County is the deadliest single incident involving abalone divers in recent memory. Witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough, choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby. Abalone is a prized delicacy that sells for up to $70 per pound. The annual abalone season brings divers out into the rough waters of northern California (stock image) The three men died after diving into rough waters off of rocky coastline in Mendocino County, California, on Sunday in search of abalone (stock imagine of abalone diver) Firefighters said the men dove into water in Caspar Cove and found themselves immediately in trouble. An off-duty firefighter who happened to be fishing nearby spotted the men and called for help. The three men who drowned were overcome by the churning water and crushed against the sharp rocks on shore. Rescuers managed to pull the two survivors and one of the dead men from the water immediately after arriving on scene. A Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office helicopter plucked the second victim from the sea and brought him to shore. Ten friends from the East Coast and San Francisco rented a house on Caspar Cove to dive for abalone, locals said. Five of them went out on Sunday - three died . Firefighters performed CPR on the two drowned men on the beach as his horrified friends watched - but both were pronounced dead on Sunday afternoon. The third man's body was found after a five-hour search that involved aircraft and boats from several fire departments and sheriff's offices, as well as the US Coast Guard. He was smashed against rocks in a cove, which required rescuers to hoist his body up the cliff with a winch because they couldn't get to him by water. Local authorities say the abalone season, which started April 1, is always marred by several rescues and often a few death.

The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey \u2013 including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family \u2013 including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children \u2013 are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 \u2013 who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago \u2013 served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul. Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed, pictured on his Facebook page with Labour Leader Ed Miliband just weeks before his son tried to cross into ISIS controlled Syria . Waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in Hatay southern of Turkey last week . He is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group. Mr Danczuk said the number of Britons fleeing the country to join ISIS \u2013 now thought to number more than 600 \u2013 exposed the failure of the Government's anti-terror strategy. He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization. 'I do not think the Government's Prevent strategy is working and we need a much smarter approach from all the authorities to stop this cancer spreading.'

Oliveira has won 14 caps for his country and was once linked to a \u00a324million move to Manchester United, but his career has stalled at Benfica and Swansea is his third loan spell in as many seasons. The 23-year-old has found it tough to make an impression in south Wales but he is set to make his second Barclays Premier League start at bottom club Leicester on Saturday with Gomis sidelined by hamstring trouble. Nelson Oliveira is on-loan at Swansea from Portuguese giants Benfica but has struggled for first-team action . The striker (right) has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury and is expected to start against\u00a0Leicester . 'I've had to be patient waiting for my chance,' Oliveira told the official Swansea website. 'But that's understandable. It's normal that when you join a very good team who are doing well and are eighth in the table, then you have to wait for your chance.' Gomis has been ruled out for between three to four weeks after being injured in the early stages of last weekend's 1-1 home draw with Everton. The France international has scored four goals in seven games and Oliveira, who has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury in time to feature at the King Power Stadium, admits that Gomis' form has made life difficult for him. Oliveira is hoping to take his Swansea chance presented to him by the absence of the in-form Bafetimbi Gomis . 'Bafe has been doing very well and scoring goals,' said Oliveira, who has made seven of his eight Swansea appearances from the bench with his only start coming in the 5-0 home defeat to Chelsea in January. 'He's a good player and person and I feel for him because of the injury. 'He's been in a good moment and is important to the team. 'I'm not happy he is injured, but if it gives me a chance then I really want to take it; work hard, play well and help the team. 'It would be nice to score my first goal for the club and I'm always confident in my own ability. Manager Garry Monk is set to hand\u00a0Oliveira only the second Premier League start of his career at Swansea . 'And I know, the more I play the more confident I will get.' The injury to Gomis on the back of selling Wilfried Bony to Manchester City in January has highlighted the shortage of strikers at Swansea, and manager Garry Monk has made no secret of the fact that it is one department where the club need to strengthen this summer. 'It is an area where we need to help those who are here,' Monk said. 'We still need to look at Nelson and Marvin Emnes is not an out and out striker. 'Hopefully Nelson can have some more game time but we are looking to strengthen that area.'",

The research, carried out in Milan, backs up tests carried out by the charity Medical Detection Dogs. Its co-founder Dr Claire Guest said the charity's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer. She hailed the new study, describing the findings as 'spectacular'. Dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men's urine samples . The latest research, by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98.7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97.6 per cent . They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr Guest said: 'These results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. 'It is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a 'reluctance to embrace this tested, time-old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts. There is no single test for prostate cancer, but the most commonly used are blood tests, a physical examination or a biopsy.

'Over the years, millions of pounds of NHS funding has been poured into the traditional test methods, and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability,' Dr Guest added. 'This has caused a huge waste of resources, not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals.

The Tannadice club sparked a row with supporters when they sold star duo Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to the Parkhead club on deadline day in January. Jackie McNamara\u2019s side have won just three of their 14 games since, and lost 3-0 at home to Ronny Deila\u2019s side on Sunday. Dundee United midfielder John Souttar (right) challenges for possession with Celtic's Kris Commons . Heavily linked with Ciftci in January, the Norwegian has also earmarked 18-year-old Souttar as potential cover for Scott Brown and Nir Bitton in a holding midfield role. The teenager has recently impressed in the middle of the pitch since switching from central defence. Ciftci and Souttar are under contract until May next year and could go for a combined fee of \u00a31.5million. Admitting there is huge pressure on the Europa League contenders not to sell any more players to Celtic, however, United No 2 Simon Donnelly said: \u2018I think that\u2019s always going to be there. All the drama that was whipped up over the stuff in January wasn\u2019t helpful to the club, but we as coaches and the manager just have to try and focus on our job here. You are always going to have interest and speculation. We\u2019ve had to deal with it for the two years we\u2019ve been here.\u2019 Adding to the pressure on United was the public release of a clause in manager McNamara\u2019s contract entitling him to a cut of any transfer profits. Celtic are also interested in signing striker\u00a0Nadir Ciftc from Dundee United . Insisting Tannadice minds are focused on securing a European slot next season, Donnelly played down talk of a move for Ciftci or anyone else, adding: \u2018Nadir is a Dundee United player, so it\u2019s our job in the next five games to go and try to reach Europe and Nadir will help us do that.\u2019 Meanwhile, referee Steven McLean will be back in the firing line this weekend for the first time since he and his officials missed a crucial hand-ball by Caley Thistle defender Josh Meekings in Celtic\u2019s Scottish Cup semi final defeat to Inverness at Hampden on April 19. The duo are likely to cost Celtic around \u00a31.5million, the second double raid on the club after signing Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven . Celtic, who had been leading 1-0 at the time, went on to lose 3-2 and subsequently wrote to the SFA demanding an explanation. Meekings was hit with a notice of complaint by SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan, which could have seen him miss the final, but Inverness were successful in contesting the charge. As a result of the fall-out, McLean was spared a top-flight assignment last week, serving as fourth official in Motherwell\u2019s trip to Hamilton, but will be back in the middle on Saturday for the bottom-six clash between Kilmarnock and Accies at Rugby Park.",

The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe. 'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said.

The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build . 'It's a very difficult system to make operational.' A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher. Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University. The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write.

Goals: Messi 14, Neymar 31. Booked: Busquets, Pique. Ref: Juan Martinez Munuera. Goals from Lionel Messi and Neymar looked to have ended Sevilla\u2019s amazing 14-month unbeaten home record in La Liga, but Unai Emery\u2019s men showed why they are so hard to beat with a momentous comeback. Gerard Deulofeu was dropped from Sevilla's squad and Denis Suarez started on the bench. To be able to leave out two Barcelona loanees shows the strength in depth that the coach has. It also shows how Sevilla won the Europa League last season and why they are aiming to reach the Champions League this year. A big part of their European triumph last season was down to their captain Ivan Rakitic. Enough, in fact, that Barcelona decided to pluck him from Emery's ranks and give him a bigger stage to shine on. Rakitic says he still holds Sevilla in his heart, thanks to his four season spell in Andalusia. Perhaps his history confused him early on, with the Croat playing a terrible ball back towards his own box which didn\u2019t cost Barcelona, thanks to the referee deciding he was fouled after releasing it. Messi curled home a trademark left-footed shot against Sevilla . Real Madrid had already done their part on Saturday afternoon, seeing off Eibar at the Santiago Bernabeu and then desperately hoped Sevilla would be able to do theirs. Something had to give at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, whether it was Sevilla's streak, or Barcelona's nine-game winning run. It was Barcelona who last did the damage here in February 2014, but they could not do it again. Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets and Neymar were brought back into the Barcelona side after missing Wednesday's win against Almeria, through injury, suspension and rotation respectively. The latter had a point to prove after a run of fruitless games, where he\u2019s been more likely to cause a fight than score a goal. That wasn\u2019t the case here. Neymar hit a beautifully struck free-kick from the left, to double Barcelona\u2019s lead after half-an-hour. Messi had opened the scoring, with a goal similar to his strike in mid-week. Neymar fed the ball into the Argentine on the right-hand side of the box, who took a touch to work some space and then curled the ball sweetly around the outstretched arm of Sergio Rico and into the top left corner. The Argentine forward took his season's tally to 34 goals in La Liga . Sevilla are good opponents for Messi, who has scored more goals against them than any other side, bar Atletico Madrid. And it was Sevilla he hit a hat-trick against at the Camp Nou earlier this season, the game where he overtook Telmo Zarra\u2019s all-time record of 251 goals. When the big games have come around this season, Barcelona have brought their big game. Dani Alves, for example, has not had a good season, but when the chips are down he\u2019s dug deep. This could be the last time he plays against Sevilla, his former side, and he evoked memories of his former self, charging up the right but getting back when needed as well. However, Sevilla got themselves back in the game before the break with a long-range drive from Ever Banega, the Argentine midfielder who has been reinvigorated under Emery\u2019s watchful eye. Netmar doubled Barcelona's lead with a curling free kick into the top corner . On a day of goalkeeping errors in Spain you suspected it would be third-choice Sevilla stopper Sergio Rico adding to the list, rather than Barcelona\u2019s Claudio Bravo, but that was not the case. The latter is on course to beat Thibaut Courtois\u2019 Zamora Trophy winning 20 clean sheets from last season, with 17 so far, but could not add to his tally here. Bravo got a hand to Banega\u2019s strike but only succeeded in tipping it in off the post, rather than around it. Barcelona had chances to extend their lead, with Messi seeing a free kick tipped over, and Luis Suarez culpable of missing two huge opportunities. He blazed both over the crossbar, either side of the half-time interval. The first he was off-balance for and the angle was tricky, but the second was a golden chance. Andres Iniesta saw his shot saved by Rico, but Suarez couldn\u2019t find the empty net with the rebound. But the Catalan side weren\u2019t creating chances at will; this was hard work against durable, cunning opponents. Krychowiak made a quite phenomenal tackle on Messi which typified the sprit Sevilla showed both in this encounter and throughout the season. With the No 10 running at Sevilla's defence, the Pole fought back, eventually committing himself to a sliding challenge, from which he emerged with the ball, and started a break. Luis Suarez (left) shoots past Sevilla midfielder Daniel Carrico . Carlos Bacca \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar aside, La Liga\u2019s most proflific forward this season \u2013 went close when he whistled a strike over the top of Bravo\u2019s goal, while Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets were both booked for stopping lightning-quick attacks. It wasn\u2019t enough. Emery undid Barcelona with three substitutions, all of which paid dividends. Jose Antonio Reyes played a big part in the equaliser, which was converted by another substitute, Kevin Gameiro. Gerard Pique gave the ball away and Reyes combined with Vitolo, before Gameiro side-footed home a low, scuttled cross at the far post, to ignite the stadium. What makes things worse for Barcelona is that this game is just the start of a brutal fortnight. Enrique\u2019s side travel to Paris to play PSG on Wednesday, before hosting high-flying Valencia on Saturday. Then it\u2019s PSG again three days later, before a Catalan derby at Espanyol. By that time, they may even be playing catch-up. One crumb of comfort for Enrique though. Real Madrid still have to come to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and to a man, Barcelona\u2019s side will testify to the difficulty of emerging with three points.

Arsenal came out on top globally with 5.68million followers ahead of Chelsea (5.49m) and Manchester United (4.87m). But one country was missing: China \u2013 where the government outlaws Twitter as they seek to keep control of information and the media. Manchester United have over eight million followers on Weibo, almost double that of Twitter . Manchester City also have over eight million Weibo followers compared to 2.4million on Twitter . Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao are third on the list of clubs in the world with most Weibo followers . In Twitter\u2019s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans \u2013 just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000. Barcelona have 5.4million followers on Weibo, the fourth most of any club in the world . Arsenal have 3.6million followers on Weibo compared to 5.6 million on Twitter . United\u2019s support in China is no surprise as they have solid support across Asia on Twitter, but City punch well above their weight in China compared with the rest of the continent. Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter \u2013 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton\u2019s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez\u2019s side. Of the 10 Premier League clubs active on Weibo, six \u2013 United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham, feature in the top 20 most followed clubs in China. The Manchester clubs are first and second, with Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao \u2013 managed by Fabio Cannavaro \u2013 third and Barcelona fourth. Chelsea are 11th on the list of clubs with most followers on the Chinese microblogging site . Liverpool have 2.3million followers on Chinese site Weibo compared to 4.2million on Twitter . Bayern Munich are 13th, Real Madrid are way down in 18th \u2013 with 81,303 less followers than Tottenham \u2013 and Paris Saint Germain in 20th. And such is the popularity of the Premier League, Michael Owen has a staggering 3,074,148 followers on the site - which would put him 10th in the top 20 clubs list. With the popularity of football rapidly increasingly in China \u2013 in December 2014 the China\u2019s President made football compulsory for children and added it to the national curriculum \u2013 expect Premier League clubs to intensify their effort to grab a slice of this lucrative market. SportQuake provided the data and their founder Matt House said: 'With its thrilling brand of football, the Premier League delivers mass engagement for fans in markets all over the world. We can say with confidence that more Premier League teams will be active on Weibo next season. 'As always, football and the Premier League is leading the way with new technologies, but we expect follower figures on both Twitter and Weibo to balance out to reflect fan bases as the platforms mature.'",

Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck . Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot . 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire's\u00a0Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door. Ingenuity: The couple started with a steel frame and slowly, project by project, built a home in about a year and a half . Gorgeous: Hannah and Alex now have a gorgeous, wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook . Details: The couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold, stained glass windows and other creature comforts . They're nearly self-sufficient, too. The home is powered mostly by solar panels. Alex said their first power bill was just $25. The stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring. 'I didn't want to live inside a plastic box,' Alex said. 'Not because I'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be.' All told, the project cost Hannah and Alex about $25,000. And the couple even plans to build another one like one day. 'It's really, really nice,' Hannah said. 'We love it.' Two bedrooms: The home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps . Green: Water comes from a nearby spring and most of the electricity comes from solar panels .",

But according to his\u00a0trainer, former professional boxer Terry Claybon, it took a huge amount of work to get the 34-year-old actor ripped for the shoot, including six months of training before filming even started. He also worked out for an incredible six hours per day, including 2,000 sit ups, 1,000 each morning and the same at night. Of course, Jake had to work even harder to get in shape because he had just  dropped approximately 30lbs to play freelance crime reporter Lou, who stumbles upon the dangerous underworld of Los Angeles in Nightcrawler. Scroll down for video . Blood, sweat and tears: According to his trainer, it took a huge amount of work to get Jake Gyllenhaal ripped for Southpaw, including six months of training before filming started, 2,000 sit ups and six hours of training each day . Much thinner: The 34-year-old lost 30 pounds for 2014 thriller Nightcrawler and had \u00a0to put that weight \u00a0back on plus 15lbs of muscle . He not only returned to his normal weight - but he then put on another 15 pounds of pure muscle to play the desperate fighter Billy Hope. His trainer Claybon told Yahoo: 'Gradually we built up, day-by-day, to 2,000. It takes time to do that', and revealed that his exercise regime included, 'three hours of boxing in the morning and three hours of strengthening, conditioning, and cardio at night.' Speaking about his weight loss for Nightcrawler, Jake told Us Weekly: 'I knew that [Lou] was literally and figuratively hungry, [so I got into the] mode where I was always a bit hungry. Beaten: The trailer shows a muscular Gyllenhaal bloodied and bruised by an opponent in the boxing ring . Bulking up: Jake poses here with his trainers, including former boxer Terry Claybon (second from right), who was responsible for whipping the once-scrawny actor into shape . Gyllenhaal also attended several boxing matches to watch how real fighters move in the ring . 'It's not different than getting into character for anything. It's more about believing where you are and being present where you are. Who's to say what the process is? I have a strange one \u2026 but I love what I do.' Claybon explained to Yahoo that Jake put back on the weight he had lost before gaining an extra 15 pounds of muscle for Southpaw. Health experts told the Daily Telegraph\u00a0that Gyllenhaal likely went on a high-protein diet, that likely included protein powder. He likely had to consume 130 grams of protein - two and a half times the daily recommended intake. Health experts also told the Telegraph that such drastic body changes could cause long-term damage to his body. The huge swing in Gyllenhaal's physique recalls other drastic changes actors have made in their bodies. Among the most recent and most notable is\u00a0Matthew McConaughey's turn from  Magic Mike hunk to Dallas Buyers Club AIDS patient. Meanwhile, in Southpaw, Jake plays Billy Hope, a professional boxer who must rebuild his life after his wife is killed and his daughter is taken away from him. The recent trailer opens with Gyllenhaal's understatement: 'I expected a hard fight. I put my family through a lot.' It then cuts to him in the ring bloodied and bruised as he takes a relentless pounding from an opponent, while his wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson look on in horror, before Hope suddenly turns it around sends the other boxer to the canvass. Horrified: His wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson can only stand by and watch ringside . Adrenelin: Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a boxer who allows himself take punches to fire himself up . The reason Gyllenhaal's character allowed himself to take the beating in the first place is then explained. 'The more you get hit the harder you fight, I get it,' his wife says. 'Only now you've taken way to many hits before you get off. You cant fight like that any more. Think about her.' She's talking about the couple's only daughter Leila, who is played by film newcomer Oona Laurence. The youngster is fresh from lauded performances on Broadway as Matilda in the stage adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic. But the trailer also reveals there's a much more devastating blow in store for Hope, when his wife is accidentally shot dead by a bodyguard during an altercation with he has with another boxer who had been taunting him, which McAdam's character had told him to walk away from. Doomed: The two-and-a-half minute clip reveals McAdams is killed during an altercation between Hope and another boxer . Hopeless: The boxer must fight to regain his daughter, who is taken from him by child services following the death of his wife . Young star: Leila Hope is played by Oona Laurence who just wowed audiences on Broadway as Matilda . And things get worse for the embattled boxer as the child protection services take his daughter away from him after he falls into a dangerous cycle of self destruction following the death of the child's mother. The film also stars Rita Ora, who recently played Christian Grey's sister in Fifty Shades Of Grey, as well as Forest Whitaker and Naoime Harris, replacing Lupita Nyong'o who dropped out in August.

The giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs (2.7kg) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been. It was was extracted from a 45-year-old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This condition causes fluid-filled cysts to grow in the kidneys, so they expand in size. Surgeons have removed the kidneys, which weighed as much as a newborn baby, from a 45-year-old man with a genetic disease. Scan shows the kidneys, which had grown to 20 times their normal size . Incredibly, a week after his initial operation at Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs (2.5kg) was removed. Both kidneys beat the previous record of 4.7lbs (2.1kg), which was removed in Dhule, India, in 2011, according to Guinness World Records. Normally, healthy kidneys weigh between 125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. The patient was diagnosed with ADPKD, which is potentially lethal, last year. He arrived at the hospital suffering from high fever, blood in his urine and severe abdominal pain before he was admitted. 'I used to remain tired throughout the day due to excessive blood loss,' the patient, whose name has not been released by the hospital, said. It took a team of surgeons three hours to remove the giant organ, before he was then put on dialysis. He will soon receive a kidney transplant. Dr Bhargav, one of the surgeons who carried out the procedure, said: 'The kidney was 20 times the normal size and was stuck around the intestines. Normal healthy kidneys weight between\u00a0125g and 170g in men - less than half a pound. One of the kidneys the doctors removed weighed 6lbs (2.7kg) (is is pictured on the scales) 'The patient is recovering and awaiting a kidney transplant.' ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Cysts develop in the kidneys, and often the livers and the pancreas. Over time, they grow and multiple, replacing normal healthy tissue and causing the kidneys to stop working. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms and the cysts won't be noticed until adulthood. They will vary by individual but may include back or abdominal pain, recurrent urinary infections or blood in the urine, kidney stones and kidney failure. Two thirds of adults with ADPKD will develop high blood pressure, and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited condition that causes small, fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys. Although children are born with the condition, ADPKD does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys' functions. In most cases, this doesn't occur until 30-60 years of age. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including abdominal pain, high blood pressure, blood in the urine, urine infections and kidney stones. Eventually, kidney function gets worse and worse, until so much is lost that kidney failure develops. ADPKD affects between 1 in 700-1,000 individuals worldwide, with 12.5 million cases globally, and is currently incurable. It is caused by mutations in one or more genes, causing them to function abnormally. Sources: NHS Choices and Polycystic Kidney Charity .",

Thrifty motorists whose budgets won't stretch to the favourite luxury car of the Labour peer might consider 'two dragons' instead. For Korea's SsangYong is launching a new sports utility vehicle from under \u00a313,000 that promises value for money motoring for drivers who believe in watching their pennies. But SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') has given its new sporty five-door family runaround a very European name - Tivoli - after the stylish Italian town near Rome, home to the Villa d'Este, a Unesco world heritage site famed for its Renaissance architecture and garden. SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') is launching a value for money sports utility vehicle . Pitched to take on the pumpedup Nissan Juke, the Tivoli SUV is powered by 1.6 litre Euro 6 petrol and diesel engines with six speed manual and automatic transmissions. It arrives in the UK this summer in three trim levels - SE, EX, ELX - with a choice of front-wheel drive or 'intelligent' 4x4 and seven airbags across the range. There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty. The entry level SE, from \u00a312,950, is finished in grey cloth trim and includes 16-in alloys, cruise control, a petrol stop/go system, seven airbags and 'smart' steering with normal, comfort and sport modes. The top-of-the-range ELX, from \u00a316,000 to \u00a319,000, comes fully loaded with a choice of the full range of engines and gearboxes plus diamond cut alloy wheels, smart keyless starting, front and rear parking sensors, privacy glass, rear spoiler, automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, TomTom navigation system with 7 in touch screen and a rear-view camera. There is a choice of six exterior colours, and even a 'My Tivoli' personalisation programme which allows customers to create their own distinctive car. This includes the styling pack (\u00a3400) which gives a choice of five two-tone roof combinations, plus further engine and drivetrain options. As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy connectivity to their IT devices. SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year. UK chief executive Paul Williams says: 'This is a car that will really put SsangYong on the map and change perceptions.' Citroen's Aircross model (above) has protective alloy bumps front and side . Motorists of a certain age may recall those fondly remembered TV adverts from childhood for rufty-tufty Tonka Toys. These were virtually indestructible metal cars - usually 4x4s or trucks with massive wheels. The TV advert informed viewers: 'They build real tough toys, for real tough boys - Tonka!' Well, Citroen seems to have taken its inspiration from them for its Aircross model (above). It even has protective alloy bumps front and side made from honeycomb aluminium castings surrounded by hard rubber. Billed as a big brother to the current Citroen C4 Cactus, it was shown in prototype hybrid form at the Shanghai Motor Show in China. Citroen's global boss, Briton Linda Jackson, says her company has to regain the sort of design flair that created the 2CV: 'If we want stand-out cars, then we have to be bold.' The prototype has a 1.6 litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor combining to create 313bhp. Citroen claims a special boost function will help it accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.5 seconds. Don't hold your breath. But many do see it as France's answer to Britain's new Land Rover Discovery Sport. Ii is almost time for the next Goodwood Festival of Speed. Tickets have now gone on sale for the event which runs from June 25 to 28. The theme of 'Flat-Out and Fearless: Racing on the Edge' pays tribute to the drivers and constructors throughout history who 'threw caution to the wind in pursuit of victory'. Goodwood favourites: JackieStewart and his wife Helen . The festival, billed as 'the world's largest automotive garden party' is held in the grounds of Lord March's Goodwood House and estate near Chichester, West Sussex. It attracts the A-list of the world motor manufacturing chiefs, motor sport legends - from Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart - as well as showbiz celebrities in a way the original British Motor Show never could. More than 600 cars and motorcycles spanning the phenomenal history of motoring and motor sport take part alongside a 'Moving Motor Show' presented by the AA. The traditional central feature - a vast automotive-themed sculpture - will this year honour Japanese car giant Mazda's contribution to motoring and motor sport in the year that the latest incarnation of its best-selling MX-5 sports car is launched. Details and tickets: goodwood.com. Race and road car designer Professor Gordon Murray - who produced the legendary McLaren F1 supercar - is to collaborate with engine specialist Osamu Goto to create an ultracompact fuel-efficient vehicle for city use. But it has to run on conventional fuels such as petrol. The car, being sponsored by Shell under the code-name 'Project M' is to be unveiled in November.",

Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch star in the new season, which premieres June 21. Here's the plot synopsis, according to Den of Geek: . \"A bizarre murder brings together three law-enforcement officers and a career criminal, each of whom must navigate a web of conspiracy and betrayal in the scorched landscapes of California. Colin Farrell is Ray Velcoro, a compromised detective in the all-industrial City of Vinci, LA County. Vince Vaughn plays Frank Semyon, a criminal and entrepreneur in danger of losing his life's work, while his wife and closest ally (Kelly Reilly), struggles with his choices and her own. Rachel McAdams is Ani Bezzerides, a Ventura County Sheriff's detective often at odds with the system she serves, while Taylor Kitsch plays Paul Woodrugh, a war veteran and motorcycle cop for the California Highway Patrol who discovers a crime scene which triggers an investigation involving three law enforcement groups, multiple criminal collusions, and billions of dollars.\" Yes, please. The first season starred Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as a pair of Louisiana State Police detectives investigating the death of a young woman. The crime drama proved to be a runaway hit, and the season 1 finale crashed the HBO Go site in March 2014.",

Jamie Jewitt, 24,\u00a0and Henry Rogers, 22, both admit that when they were in their teens, their self-esteem was at rock bottom. Henry, from Ealing, reached eighteen stone at his heaviest.\u00a0Before he made his foray into modelling, Henry, 22, was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. Scroll down for video . Henry Rogers, 22, hit 18st at his heaviest, left, but went on an intense two-year diet, including going vegan for a year, and now he's a sought-after model, right . At this point, he was keen to pursue a career in rugby, which was his passion. However, after reaching 18st, he decided to embark on a strict diet and after shedding the pounds and slimming down to 12st, he landed a job at Abercrombie & Fitch, where he was scouted by top agency, Models 1. His best friend Jamie Jewitt, 24, from Essex,\u00a0weighed 15st before his 15th birthday. Jamie was so self-conscious with his looks, he barely posed for any photographs and has hardly any snaps from his teen years. Before he made his foray into modelling, left, Henry was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. After shedding the weight, he landed a job in Abercrombie & Fitch and his career sky-rocketed from there, right . The men are using their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the 'shame' around body image and insecurity amongst men . After two years of intense and solid training - which included following a strict vegan diet for a year - he shed the excess weight and now weighs 12st. After he shed the weight, his family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked. The first casting was unsuccessful and he focused on his education. But fearing that he'd feel defeated, his parents encouraged him to go to a second casting. He was successful and moved out to New York alone to pursue his career in modelling. Despite initial setbacks, the pair  have since fronted campaigns for Tom Ford, Armani, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana. Jamie Jewitt, 24, from Essex, pictured left, at school, weighed 15st before his 15th birthday and was so self-conscious he would hardly ever pose for photos.\u00a0After two years of intense and solid training - which included following a vegan diet for a year - he shed the excess weight and now weighs 12st, right . The duo have even ventured into the world of reality TV, starring on New York's answer to Made In Chelsea, Taking New York. The boys have, however, left the show to focus on their modelling careers. And now, they say they want to use their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the \u2019shame\u2019 around \u2018body image\u2019 and \u2018insecurity\u2019 amongst men. So why do some men struggle to talk about body insecurities? Jamie and Henry think it is a 'masculine thing'. Discussing the topic, Jamie said: 'This year we have seen women leading the way. The likes of the Spice Girls encouraged the \"feel good\" movement. They encouraged women coming together and celebrating \"body beautiful\". 'But, for men, we are all too cowardly to talk about body image and insecurities. Even though we are all feeling it, we are not having those discussions down the gym. You don\u2019t want to be that guy that gets a tough time from your mates for talking out. It is silly really.' After he shed the weight, Jamie's family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked - and he managed to get spotted and now stars in the biggest designer's campaigns . The pair want to use their newfound platform for the better and are getting set to promote healthy male body image in a photoshoot with Attitude/Ateen coming out in June . Henry added: 'For some reason men don\u2019t feel like they can admit that they are insecure about their looks, that they don\u2019t feel the same pressures that women do. But with all the women paving the way for us and speaking out so confidently about their insecurities, we thought, why not admit to the world that we\u2019re not always comfortable in our skin either. 'Where are the male celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? There aren\u2019t any. Where are the female celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? Everywhere. 'From Pink to Kelly Clarkson. Women are out there talking loud and proud. We are letting the side down.'

But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video . Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant . Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom . The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail . An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna . Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations . This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in . Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations . 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at \u00a33.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'",

The 24-year-old Belgian has scored 18 goals across all competitions for his club this season, helping the Blues win the Capital One Cup and putting them on the brink of a first Premier League title since 2010. He was rewarded for his sterling performances with the top individual award of the night at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. Victory in their next two games - at Leicester and at home to Crystal Palace - would see Chelsea wrap up the championship. Eden Hazard poses with the PFA trophy after winning the award with a superb season in a Chelsea shirt . The 24-year-old Belgian poses with the trophy after collecting the gong at a glittering award ceremony at London's Grosvenor Hotel . Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille in 2012 and put pen to paper on a new five-and-a-half-year deal with the club in February . Didier Drogba posted this picture on Instagram  of Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Hazard, John Terry and Cesc Fabregas . John Terry posted this photograph with Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and Gary Cahill at the PFA Awards ceremony . Hazard has remarkably won Player of the Year or Young Player of the Year every season since 2009 with Lille or Chelsea. Hazard said of his award success: 'I'm very happy. One day I want to be the best and what I did this season is play very well, Chelsea played very well. 'I don't know if I deserve to win but it is good for me. 'It is good, it is better to be voted by the players - they know everything about football. This is good. I'm very happy.' He took the Young Player of the Year prize 12 months ago, and has rapidly progressed to the top award. 'We are almost champions, maybe this is the key,' said Hazard. 'Last season we finished third and this season we have an opportunity to win the league. This has changed from last season. 'I continue like I did last season - I try to be the same. I try to score more goals than last season. Personally I have played a good season, I have been there in the big games and I scored a lot of important goals, this is why I'm better this season.' Hazard has dazzled for Chelsea this season as the Blues look certain to win the first Premier League title of Jose Mourinho's second stint . Hazard coolly slots past David de Gea to score the only goal of the game against Manchester United to extend Chelsea's lead at the top . Hazard battles for possession with Francis Coquelin as Chelsea continued their march toward the title with a goalless draw at Arsenal . PFA Young Player of the Year: Harry Kane . PFA Merit award: Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard . PFA Premier League Team of the Year . PFA Championship Team of the Year . PFA League One Team of the Year . PFA League Two Team of the Year . PFA Women's Player of the Year: Ji So-yun . PFA Women's Young Player of the Year: Leah Williamson . Hazard's goal last weekend earned Jose Mourinho's men a 1-0 win over Manchester United. He picked out that moment as one of his best of the campaign. Asked to describe his season in a single word, Hazard struggled. 'I don't want to say 'amazing' because it is not finished yet - maybe amazing!' he said. 'I started the season not to be the PFA player of the year but it was in my head - I want to be the best and I hope one day I can win a lot of trophies. 'I just want to say thank you to the players who voted for me - it is always good to have an individual trophy but the most important thing is to win the league. 'I hope I can win a lot of trophies again - the most important is to win the league, without my team-mates I would not be here. 'Jose (Mourinho) lets me play, we talk sometimes together and when I'm on the pitch I know what I have to do, this is most important. 'We are almost there to win the league. 'Last season we finished third, now we can bring the trophy to Stamford Bridge, personally I have played a very good season, have scored a lot of important goals and this is why I'm here. Hazard is embraced by team-mates after giving Chelsea the lead against Arsenal in October . Hazard has already won silverware this season, with the brilliant Belgian clutching the Capital One Cup with countryman Thibaut Courtois . Hazard (front) skips past the challenge of Manchester United's Wayne Rooney as the Chelsea man launches another attack . Mourinho has long sung the praises of the 24-year-old, believing he is rivalled by only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the global order. 'I had lots of stars, but he is the humble star,' the Portuguese said last weekend. 'He knows that he is one of the three best players in the world, the responsibility that comes (with that) and he is coping with that responsibility. 'He understands that his talent is fundamental for the team.' Hazard was earlier on Sunday named in the PFA Premier League team of the year - for the third time in his three seasons in England. He was one of six Blues players in the XI, along with captain John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa. The PFA Premier League Team of the Year for the 2014-15 season was announced ahead of Hazard being named Player of the Year . Hazard has benefited from working with Mourinho, with the Portuguese coach adding grit to his naturally flamboyant game . Ivanovic, though, was in no doubt as to the team's most influential cog. The Serbia defender, speaking about Hazard last week, said: 'He has been our most important player since day one. 'He is the guy who you just have to give the ball and he will do everything. 'Sometimes he looks so impressive, like he is not from this world.' Hazard arrived at Stamford Bridge in June 2012 - having been crowned Ligue 1 player of the year in each of his final two campaigns with Lille - for a fee reportedly around \u00a332million. Tottenham's Harry Kane - the only English attacking player in the team of the season - took the 2014/15 Young Player of the Year award. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a remarkable rise to stardom, scoring 30 goals for Spurs in all competitions this term despite not being given a regular starting slot until November. He helped Mauricio Pochettino's men to the Capital One Cup final, and also scored 79 seconds into his senior England debut as a substitute in the 4-0 European Championship qualifying victory over Lithuania at Wembley last month. Elsewhere, Ji So-yun of Chelsea Ladies won the\u00a0PFA Women's Player of the Year, while\u00a0Leah Williamson of Arsenal Ladies won the PFA Women's Young Player of the Year. Harry Kane capped a tremendous breakout season by walking away with the Young Player of the Year award . Kane's fairytale season featured a goal at Wembley on his England debut, just seconds after coming on against Lithuania .

The red, worn chair will be removed from its enclosure at Dearborn's Henry Ford Museum and displayed in an open plaza on April 15 as part of the museum's observance of the assassination's 150 anniversary. Two days earlier, it will be onstage when renowned historian and Lincoln expert Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers a sold-out lecture at The Henry Ford. The chair in which Abraham Lincoln was shot has been on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, for 85 years. On April 15, it will be removed from its encasing to be displayed for the 150th anniversary of the assassination . Abraham Lincoln (left) was shot in Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. on April 14, 1865 by pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth (right). Lincoln died from his injuries the next day . The chair has a dark stain on the back, which many visitors believe to be blood from the shooting. But historians at the museum say that the stain is\u00a0oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before Lincoln . Lincoln's chair has been part of the museum started by pioneering automaker Henry Ford - no relation to the theater-owning Ford family - since its founding 85 years ago. The government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence, and it ended up at the Smithsonian Institution. The wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it, then sold it at auction to an agent working for Henry Ford. Henry Ford also bought the Logan County Courthouse where Lincoln practiced law in Illinois in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as Greenfield Village. For decades, the theater chair was housed in that courthouse. Around 1980, the chair was placed inside the museum, where it's now part of the 'With Liberty and Justice for All' exhibit. 'Lincoln was one of Henry Ford's heroes - when he decided he wanted to have this village, he wanted to collect Lincoln stuff as an educational tool,' said curator Donna Braden. 'The courthouse is pretty much the first thing Henry Ford acquired related to Lincoln and the chair came soon after.' A playbill from Our American Cousin from the night President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn . A copy of a hand colored 1870 lithographic print by Gibson & Co. provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows John Wilkes Booth shooting U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as he sits in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre . A copy of a 1865 lithographic print by Currier & Ives provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows the same event from a different angle . Many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are Lincoln's blood. Not so, say museum workers: The stains are oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before that fateful night when Lincoln was shot by a pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth. Steve Harris, a historic presenter at the museum, tells passers-by that Lincoln's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6ft, 4in tall. Taking in objects from the final hours of two important American lives is a major draw to the museum. The Henry Ford also owns the limousine President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was fatally shot in Dallas nearly a century later. Museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum, along with the bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement. Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. has arranged the presidential box identically to the way it was the night Lincoln was shot through the doorway . Abraham Lincoln's iconic silk top hat, which he was wearing the night he was assassinated, is part of the museum display at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Goodwin, author of 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,' told The Associated Press that the chair will offer an extra 'dimension' to her words and the experience of those in the room. 'There's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time,' she said. 'And hopefully, along with that, you're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile.' Museum visitor Jeff Buczkiewicz\u00a0stood before the chair, peered silently into the glass-enclosed case at the rocking chair, then snapped pictures for posterity . 'You just get drawn into these things,' said Buczkiewicz, 47, who came from suburban Chicago with his family to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. 'It is a tragic part of our history and our country. I think it's important to take it all in.' Milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo. About 8,000 people visited the limo on November 22, 2013, a free-admission day marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the Lincoln anniversary, which also has free admission. The single-shot Deringer pistol John Wilkes Booth used to kill Abraham Lincoln is displayed at the Center for Education and Leadership at Ford's Theatre in Washington . 'It really is about the power of the artifact,' said Patricia Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford, as the entire history attraction is known. 'It's less about the artifact itself than the symbolic nature of the artifact that represents a great paradigm change in the history of our country,' she added. Buskiewicz has also visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas where Kennedy was assassinated. 'You just have to try to take it in when you're in those areas,' he said, but he wonders 'why we gravitate' toward places and things associated with these types of events. Goodwin, whose book helped inspire Steven Spielberg's movie, 'Lincoln,' says that standing before iconic yet everyday objects provides a deep experience that transcends the moment that made them famous. 'In some ways, it's more familiar when it's a chair, a bus or a limo,' she said. 'There's something about the tangibility of these things.' The chair in which Lincoln was show is regularly displayed in an encasing at The Henry Ford Museum. For the 150th anniversary it will be taken out of the encasing .",

The veteran host was attempting to warm up the studio audience ahead of his show on Monday when he made the off-colour gag. Letterman had just opened up questions to the floor, and fielded the first query of the night from a college employee, reported the\u00a0New York Post. They asked what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates. Letterman, who was in 2009 forced to admit to string of affairs, said:\u00a0'Treat a lady like a wh\u2013e, and a wh\u2013e like a lady.' But the joke received a frosty\u00a0reception from the shocked crowd. After being met with stunned silence, the host attempted to recover by offering further advice to graduates to 'eat salad' and 'always be nice'. However, several audience members at the Ed Sullivan Theater were furious over the sexist joke. Retired Jerry Stockton, from Virginia, called it 'disrespectful to women' while another, who would not be named, said it had been an 'odd choice' for the first joke of the evening. The gag is thought to have been a reference to a saying by 1930s screenwriter Wilson Mizner. Scroll down for video . Joe Logan, 41, from Pennsylvania, told the New York Post:\u00a0'Younger people watch his show. We already live in a culture that objectifies women, it's not right to make a joke like that.' A Letterman spokesman said he could not 'confirm the accuracy' of Monday's failed joke and would not comment further. But a source close to the show insisted 'It got a big laugh.' Letterman carried on with the show which had guests including John Travolta and Amy Schumer, star of her eponymous Comedy Central show, 'Inside Amy Schumer.' Old friends: David thanked John for being his friend over the decades during Monday's show. It was during a Monday warm up that he made the gag . The Grease actor, 61, had tried to bring his son Ben on to meet his 'old friend' Letterman but the nervous youngster had fled the stage into his mother's arms. The host later offered some advice to Schumer and instructed her to 'do something now that you'll regret.' So the comedienne immediately lifted her dress and flashed... her surfing scar to a relieved-looking Letterman. In October 2009, the veteran host of the Late Show had been forced to admit to a string of affairs live on air  by a blackmailing producer. The host made the shocking revelation on his show that he had cheated on his wife, Regina Lasko, whom he had only married that March. He made the confession after becoming the victim of an extortion plot concocted by a then-CBS producer, Robert Halderman, who demanded $2 million in exchange for his silence over the affairs. Letterman is now planning to retire from the show after more than 20 years of hosting on May 20. Good times: David rubbed his forehead while Amy cracked up after he told her to do something she'd regret .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of \"manifesting an egregious lack of integrity\" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable. In a written statement issued last week, Oz said, \"I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves. We provide multiple points of view, including mine which is offered without conflict of interest.  That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts. For example, I do not claim that GMO (genetically modified organism) foods are dangerous, but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world. I will address this on the show next week.\" That show was taped on Tuesday and in a clip posted online after the taping, he tells his audience he will not be silenced. The episode will air on Thursday afternoon in most markets, Friday in others. It all started when a group of 10 physicians from across the country emailed a letter to Columbia University expressing disapproval that Oz is on the faculty. The email sent to Columbia's faculty dean for Health Sciences and Medicine, Dr. Lee Goldman, said the group is \"surprised and dismayed\" that Oz is on faculty and that he holds a senior administrative position. Oz is vice chair of the Department of Surgery, at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The email was sent by Dr. Henry Miller, a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. It was signed by nine other physicians from across the country, none of whom is affiliated with Columbia. They accuse Oz of what they call \"manifesting an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.\" They go on to say Oz has \"either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both.\" The doctors argue in their emailed letter that Oz shows \"disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.\" It's worth noting that Miller previously worked at the FDA, at one point reviewing genetically engineered drugs. As an example, they cite an investigation reported on the show in 2011 in which apple juice was presented as having unsafe levels of arsenic. The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible. This is not the first time Oz has been called out. He was in the hot seat on Capitol Hill at a June 2014 hearing on false advertising for deceptive weight loss products featured on his show. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, and chairwoman of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Insurance, said at the hearing he was perpetuating scams, whether it was intentional or not. Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable. The doctors, who are in different areas of the country and different facets of the medical community, all have a connection to Miller although they do not all know each other. CNN has reached out to all of them. Those who have responded say Miller invited them to sign the email. Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course. \"He's a charlatan, and Columbia elevating him to a position of authority is a credence and platform for misleading more people,\" she said in a phone interview. Fleet was a classmate of Miller's at MIT. Dr. Joel Tepper, a radiology professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, is also a former classmate of Miller's. He told CNN he does not have a vendetta against Oz. He said he just wants him to \"follow the basic rules of science and state what he knows as fact as fact and state what he doesn't know as fact as not fact.\" He and Fleet share McCaskill's example of Oz's promotion of \"miracle weight loss drugs\" on the show as failure on Oz's part to follow the oath taken by doctors to do no harm. Dr. Gordon Gill, professor emeritus of medicine and of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of San Diego School of Medicine, wrote in a letter to CNN: \"In discussions with Henry, I agreed that the imprimatur of Columbia Medical School behind Dr. Oz gave an inaccurate message to TV viewers and as Dr. Goldman and I are long time colleagues I was comfortable pointing out these problems to him.\" Miller worked in Gill's research lab before he went to medical school. While the email does not call for any specific action to be taken by the university, Miller told CNN in an email that the group's goal is \"for Dr. Oz to resign from the Columbia faculty and decide that he'd prefer a career as a TV celebrity doctor.\" Oz spokesman Tim Sullivan sent an email to CNN last week listing the names of five of the 10 people who complained about Oz. The email questions the integrity and even the qualifications of those who are pointing fingers at Oz. For its part, Columbia University is standing by Oz. Spokesman Doug Levy said in a statement, \"Columbia is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.\" Levy added that the university's role is to foster research, and it will not take action that hinders public statements by faculty members. The university has no position on what faculty members say in public discussion -- that is their individual academic freedom and is provided to them in the university's governing documents, he said. A cardiac surgeon, Oz came to Columbia for his residency after medical school in 1986 and rose through the ranks. He is also the director of the Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine program at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Oz rose to fame after frequent appearances on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" led to the creation of his own show and magazine. He is also co-founder of the consumer health website Sharecare.com.

But for one New York-based writer, the urge to stand in front of a mirror and poke at and squeeze her pores for hours on end became so bad that it actually started 'sabotaging' her life. In an inspiring essay for\u00a0Marie Claire,\u00a0Jenna Marotta, 27, tells of her experience with dermatillomania - a\u00a0compulsive\u00a0skin-picking disorder that left her face bleeding - and how she managed to overcome it. 'I'd descend \"into the mirror\" for up to four hours a day,' Jenna writes in the essay, explaining how her actions horrified her parents. 'I would nick and squeeze and yank at every clogged pore on my face.' Scroll down for video . Obsessive behavior: Jenna Marotta, 27, of New York, says her habit of picking at the pores on her face was so all-consuming that it became 'self-sabotaging' At first, Jenna was just looking for a way to break out of her binge-eating routine. As a child she developed bad eating habits - she would skip breakfast and lunch, then stuff her face with whatever she wanted for hours when she got home. Her binge-eating cycle continued through college and after graduation, when she moved back home to her parents' house in Illinois. 'I knew I was bingeing while I was bingeing,' she writes, adding that part of the problem was that she would head to the kitchen whenever she felt bored. 'So I decided to find a new place to spend my ample downtime.' That place became her parents' bathroom, where her mom kept a stainless steel 10x magnifying mirror and an array of Tweezerman tweezers. Jenna's use of the tweezers started off innocently enough, with her plucking out stray hairs along her eyebrows. Then she started to become obsessive, revisiting her brows several times a day and moving on to other areas of her face, where she would use those same tweezers to clear out pores and remove ingrown hairs. 'At one point, I became convinced that there was a lone dark hair trapped under my chin,' she says. 'I could think of nothing more vital than removing this growth from my face. In the process of freeing the (probably imagined) hair, I dug an eighth-inch deep hole.' Getting better: After accidentally going ten days without touching her pores when she forgot to pack her tweezers for a trip, Jenna managed to move away from her bad skin habit. She still sees a psychiatrist . Jenna was aware that her skin-picking was growing out of control and visited a 'battalion' of dermatologists, who told her that her problem was psychosomatic. So she enrolled in an an outpatient program for mental health. But once the three-week program ended, she insisted she had her problem under enough control to move on her own to New York City. The problem was not under control, however. Though the dreaded magnifying mirror was back at her parents' house in Illinois, Jenna would still lean in close to her own bathroom mirror to pick at her pores. 'I would tweeze and squeeze, filling my garbage can with tissues dotted with blood,' she writes, adding that she would hide out in her bedroom to avoid seeing her roommate, who might question her about the bloody tissues she threw out in the bathroom. And she didn't stop at using tweezers. Jenna admitted that she's also 'attacked' her face with an extruder, an earring post, an unspooled paperclip, a pushpin, a toothbrush handle, the rough side of a nail file, lotion caps, and nail clippers. One of Jenna's most agonizing memories was when the writer had to interview Steve Carrell after picking at a cyst on her chin until it bled. She worried the blood wouldn't dry in time to apply makeup before the interview. 'The urge to self-injure just always pulses through my head and hands,' she says. 'And it's my go-to method of procrastination when I have a deadline.' Luckily, while travelling to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this January, Jenna forgot her tweezers at home, resulting in ten whole days during which she didn't pick at her face. Now, the 27-year-old says she has overcome her condition - and is working on being 'nice' to herself. 'I continue to work with a psychiatrist to stay on track since I first put the tweezers down,' she says. Dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterized by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one's skin. Some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged. Sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body. The condition is often categorized as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). It can lead to bleeding, bruising and infections. CSP will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour. The skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels. However, once the damage has been done, those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness. Although the damage that is caused can be very severe, the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out CSP again and again. Treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy. Source: Anxiety UK .",

Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment: \u00a0This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady\u2019s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead\u2019s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration:\u00a0Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .",

Analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the Home Counties. The potential goldmine in the Weald Basin, across Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, could meet up to a third of Britain\u2019s oil demand within 15 years, according to the consortium exploring the area. Scroll down for video . UK Oil & Gas Investments say they have discovered 100billion barrels worth of oil reserves in the Weald Basin, near Gatwick airport (pictured, the well head at Horse Hill) A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . This could reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia and could be a major boost for British industry at a time when the North Sea supply is dwindling. But industry experts remained sceptical of the claims, with one describing them as \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. Since 1975, of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the UK North Sea, only 45billion have been pumped out. It is believed another 20billion barrels can be recovered before extraction becomes too difficult. Experts warned last night that only a fraction of the Weald Basin oil may be accessible for extraction. They also claimed fracking could be required to retrieve significant volumes. Stephen Sanderson, the chief executive of UKOG, said the site at Horse Hill was 'world class' and had the potential for 'significant daily oil production' at this proposed drilling site . Horse Hill Developments consortium made the discovery during test drilling in a well five miles from Gatwick Airport. UK Oil & Gas Investments, which has a 30 per cent stake, said \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile \u2013 equating to 100billion barrels across the basin. At current crude prices, this could be worth \u00a33.7trillion. Stephen Sanderson of UKOG, which insisted it would not use fracking, said: \u2018By 2030, we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the UK\u2019s oil demand from within the Weald area.\u2019 Neil Ritson, of fellow consortium firm Solo Oil, said it was of \u2018major economic significance\u2019. If flow tests showed oil could be extracted, the production process could begin within 18 months, he added. US firm Nutech, which conducted the tests, estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted \u2013 up to 15billion barrels. UKOG chairman David Lenigas said drilling in the Weald could create \u2018many thousands\u2019 of jobs. Although the exploration site covered 55 square miles out of 1,100, he said the consortium was confident the entire region was oil-rich. Works: The well is situated in this container on the proposed drilling site . Exploration: Experts are now trying to work out how much of the oil will be properly recoverable . Mr Lenigas dismissed suggestions it would be hard to extract from the site, saying the ground was limestone which acted \u2018like a big sponge\u2019 and that \u2018you can effectively suck the oil out\u2019. The Australian entrepreneur, who lives in Monaco, is a director of 16 British companies \u2013 and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices. UKOG shares soared after the firm claimed to have discovered a \u2018world-class potential resource\u2019. However, Professor Alastair Fraser, of Imperial College London, said the claims were \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. A study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region, while the British Geological Survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil. Discovery: The Horse Hill site near Gatwick in Sussex, where a large amount of oil has apparently been found . Drilling: Exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile . Development: The site is owned by a number of companies including UK Oil & Gas Investments . The professor added: \u2018The question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so.\u2019 Malcolm Graham-Wood, of oil consultants HydroCarbon Capital, suggested residents might object to rows of onshore oil wells, adding: \u2018The question is can it produce oil? It is extremely difficult with a very low recovery rate. This is potentially interesting but I wouldn\u2019t attribute any value yet.\u2019 But Mr Lenigas said: \u2018To all those people who say I am hiking up the share price, I am not. I am just saying what the Nutech report says \u2026 I feel passionate that this is globally significant for Britain.\u2019 A Department of Energy & Climate Change spokesman said: \u2018The Government welcomes any new information which expands our understanding of the potential of the Weald Basin.\u2019 There might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the Home Counties \u2013 but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits. The Government owns the land under your house \u2013 meaning homeowners have no right to any oil found beneath them. Once oil has been found, oil companies pay the Government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits. The Government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted. The only way an oil company would pay the surface landowner is if it wanted to base its drilling site on their land. However, firms that undertake fracking, which is seen as a more intrusive and controversial method of extracting oil than simply drilling, must sometimes agree to provide \u2018community benefits\u2019. This could include building a playground or school nearby the fracking site, and is seen as compensation for residents. Oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area, as well as gaining planning permission from the local council. Oil rush: The Weald Basin, of which Horse Hill is part, could contain a total of 100billion barrels . Mystery: It is not yet known how much of the area's oil will be easily recoverable . Boom: The Sussex countryside could soon be dotted with oil wells (file photo)",

Flameless: Instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters, the Illume ArcLighter creates a \u2018super high-intensity\u2019 electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes. Its inventors say it lights in any direction and is rechargeable, among other qualities shown above . Safer? Instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters, the Illume ArcLighter creates a \u2018super high-intensity\u2019 electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes. This means there is no flare ups (pictured) like with matches or conventional lighters that can easily burn fingers . Illume ArcLighter replaces a traditional flame with a high intensity electric arc that focuses its energy at the tip. It doesn\u2019t need to be refilled with fuel but is instead powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery. 'Simply place the Illume ArcLighter on its dedicated USB powered charging dock and it will be ready for the next moment you need it,\u2019 the company says. \u2018When electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter, it produces what is known as an electric arc. \u2018The air between these electrodes becomes ionised, creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat.' \u2018When electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter, it produces what is known as an electric arc,' the company explains. \u2018The air between these electrodes becomes ionised, creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat.\u2019 While the arc may be smaller than an open flame, it is much hotter, so it lights wicks more quickly and can be used from any angle. The company says: \u2018Unlike a regular lighter, there is no flame that can flare-up when positioned upside down. \u2018You can freely use the Illume ArcLighter in any direction. Even completely vertically.' The lighter has flame-proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body. It focuses its heat at the tip so it won\u2019t leave sooty marks behind. Convenient: The device (pictured) has a built-in lithium ion battery and comes with a USB-powered dock (also shown) so it can be easily recharged.\u00a0The lighter has flame-proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body . The device has a built-in lithium ion battery and comes with a USB-powered dock so it can be easily recharged. The start-up shows the lighter being used to ignite candles, incense, gas stove tops and paper as long as the material fits between the electrodes. The device costs CAD$40 (\u00a321 or US$32) via Kickstarter\u00a0including the charger and cable. It's expected to ship in November. Durable: The device (pictured), called the Illume ArcLighter, contains a lithium-ion battery and can be recharged, meaning that users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again .",

Nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on May 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s. Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservatives, narrowly topped the polls assessing who 'won' the two-hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for Britain. Crucially, 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed Cameron as 'the most impressive' on the subject of the economy, which lies at the heart of each party's campaign. But pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be Cameron or the Labour Party's Ed Miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast. Scroll down for video . The build-up: Prime Minister David Cameron went head-to-head with six other party leaders in a TV debate on Thursday night in an unusual format for Britain. It comes six weeks ahead of the general election on May 7 . Neck-and-neck: Cameron was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out Miliband (right) Nicola Sturgeon, of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate, which also featured the environment-focused Green Party, led by Natalie Bennett, and Wales' Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party completed the line-up. Analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a 'killer line' that would set them apart from the other participants. 'There was clearly no knock-out blow,' said Peter Kellner of pollster YouGov. Jonny Tudor, 17, who asked one of the questions on the night, said afterwards: 'Some performed well in answer to certain questions, other performed well on different subjects, but there was no definitive winner.' A rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted Cameron to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets. Too close to call? Pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the Labour Party's Ed Miliband (left) or David Cameron (right) in the top job after votes are cast. But polls named Cameron as last night's debate 'winner' Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . Rare moment of drama: A woman stood up during the debate to heckle Cameron about homelessness . But in a result that will calm Conservative nerves, a Comres/ITV poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged Cameron was the most capable of leading Britain, compared to 28 per cent who named Miliband. The event was the first and only full TV debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters, many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy. It is the only time Cameron and Miliband will go head-to-head on issues of policy before votes are cast. In one of Cameron's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance, he pointed to his rivals, one-by-one, and said: 'What I'm hearing is more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes, some more debt and more taxes, and definitely more debt and more taxes.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was forced to reference mistakes he made in the last five years in coalition . Hot topics: Immigration divided leaders, as the UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage (pictured) insisted Britain will have to leave the European Union in order to have control over the nation's borders .",

Kyle Iveson burst into a convenience store and demanded cash from shop assistant Karen Brown, the mother of his ex-girlfriend and grandmother of his daughter. He attempted to disguise his identity by lowering his voice, but she instantly recognised him and was able to report him to the police straight away. Scroll down for video . Caught: Robber Kyle Iveson, left, was apprehended by his own mother-in-law Karen Brown, right . CCTV images show Iveson, 24, taking a 12in knife into the Thorougoods shop in Clitheroe, Lancashire and threatening Mrs Brown, 54. He escaped with \u00a3650, but was quickly arrested and has now pleaded guilty to robbery and being in possession of a bladed article. Speaking after Iveson was jailed for three years at Preston Crown Court, Mrs Brown said: 'He was shouting and swearing and straight away I knew it was him. 'He was one of those people who has a certain type of walk and although he had a scarf around his face and his hood up, I recognised him a mile off. 'I think it was half personal and half to line his pockets - but he's stupid and he thought I wouldn't know it was him.' Terror: Iveson was brandishing a 12in knife when he burst into the convenience store . Threat: The robber demanded money from Mrs Brown while trying to hide his identity . The court heard that Mrs Brown had known Iveson for several years, after he had a year-long relationship with her daughter and the couple had a child together. Prosecutor Neil Basarya said: 'She was in a state of panic and attempted to open the till.The till was opened and a large amount of notes were taken by Iveson. 'At one point he dropped some to the floor and collected them before exiting the shop, still holding the knife up.' In a victim impact statement read out to the court, Mrs Brown described Iveson as extremely aggressive and said the robbery had made her feel vulnerable whenever a customer entered the shop wearing a hood. 'All I want is my life back how it was and then I hope I can return to a normal and happy life,' she said. Defending Iveson, Adam Lodge said he was addicted to heroin and had committed the robbery to fund his habit. Mr Lodge said: 'There is some degree of remorse and he does mention that this incident would have been petrifying for her, but mentions she was not the specific target.' Theft: He pulled out \u00a3650 in cash from the till but was arrested by police shortly afterwards . Target: The robbery took place at the Thorougoods convenience store in Clitheroe, Lancashire . Judge Jonathan Gibson told Iveson: 'You had a long kitchen knife and you used that knife to point towards the lady who was serving in the shop. 'Not surprisingly, the offence has had a very significant impact on her.' As well as three years in prison, Iveson is subject to a restraining order which bans him from contacting Mrs Brown in any way. Reliving the moment that Iveson threatened her, Mrs Brown said: 'He just came at it with me, he was holding it in the air. He came round the side of the counter and he had the knife at the side of me. 'He was trying to get the till open and he kept saying \"You'd better get that till open now\", and calling me a b****. 'I was determined not to let him know it was me, I just kept saying, \"Calm down, calm down.\"' After the sentencing, the victim said that Iveson's jail term was 'not long enough', adding: 'It was terrifying for me and it has ruined my life. It's no comfort at all knowing he will be out again in no time. 'I wish I could say he will change but I know he won't. He picked the shop because he knew I would be working, he knew my shift patterns. 'He came in 15 minutes after I'd started my shift that night, and it made it worse for me knowing who it was because I didn't think he would stop at anything. 'My daughter's relationship with him was a mistake and we try not to have anything to do with him. I have my granddaughter out of it and I wouldn't change her for the world, but otherwise I wish he didn't exist. 'He used to take great pleasure in grinning and taunting us when he saw us but we tried to ignore him and not let him get to us. I'm not surprised he did something like this.'",

Muhammad Ali suffered a shock defeat to Leon Spinks who had only fought seven times previously . The inexperienced Spinks celebrates his surprise 15 round split decision victory over Ali . 'Leon Spinks only had seven fights,' he said. 'Never put a fighter in there with Floyd Mayweather with seven fights.' Mayweather also criticised the 'rope-a-dope' tactics adopted by Ali against George Foreman in their Rumble in the Jungle.

Addison Russell was batting for the Chicago Cubs in the seventh inning during his first game at Wrigley Field . Russell, a rookie, swung at a first-pitch fastball and accidentally let the bat slip out of his fingers . The bat went flying and it ended up striking a fan who was sitting several rows behind the Cubs' on-deck circle . Cubs officials rushed to assist the spectator and towels from the home team's dugout were brought to the injured fan. Russell, who was ranked the No. 5 prospect in baseball earlier this month, said the bat 'just slipped', according to MLB. He said: 'I saw it connect with his face. 'I saw the dude's glasses fly, and it just wasn't pretty. I feel really bad. 'Words can't describe how bad I feel.' The rookie, 21, went 1-for-3 on Monday night and is batting .160 in six big league games for the Cubs .

Busy street: Ms Flynn was in a state of sheer panic as she concerned heard passers-by screaming 'get her out because it's all going to collapse' She had been walking to her GPs on Thursday morning to pick up a prescription when a man told her to walk around a one-foot hole in the pavement. As she did so the ground gave way and she plummeted downwards. Speaking to The Sun, she added: 'I fell and I think I screamed. Bricks were falling but didn't hit me. I'm grateful I'm not badly injured.' A worker from the Marrakech Express cafe then came to the rescue opening up their basement and leading her upstairs for a coffee. 'I felt like something stronger! I was really shaky,' she joked. Ms Flynn was taken to a hospital in Fulham and was found to have suffered whiplash and bruising. Her partner Chris Jeffries, 48, claims she could have been killed in the accident. Immediately after the incident, onlookers hearing a loud scream before Ms Flynn 'disappeared' down the gap in the road and landed on the rubble below. Ambulance crews were called to the cafe at about 8.50am to provide medical care. A man takes a picture of the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole that suddenly appeared on Thursday, exposing the cafe's basement below . At the time there was confusion over whether Ms Flynn had been pushing a pram - but this was not the case. Kate Sissons, who witnessed the fall, posted a picture on Instagram, saying: 'OMG! Poor woman and pram just disappeared down this hole on North End Rd. Shes stuck down there. She added: 'Loud scream and all I could see was the pram. Ambulance and fire on way to get her out. Scary. V v scary [sic].' A nearby flower stall owner, who asked not to be named, said she saw a man come running out of the cafe, shortly before the drama unfolded. 'The hole had been blocked off with tables and chairs but she had squeezed through and went straight down,' she said. 'She didn't have a pram or a buggy, it was a shopping trolley. 'The shop owner was shouting out to her \"Don't come through there\". 'We looked over and she was down, all the way down the hole. She had walked onto it and it had collapsed beneath her.' Scotland Yard confirmed that officers attended the scene at 8.42am and that a child had not been involved. Paul Smith, 28, a builder who was walking to work when he saw what he described as a 'shocking' scene. He said: 'Someone had fallen through - just like a trapdoor. It's crazy.

I couldn't see inside to see if it was a man or a woman but it was a person and the police were all around.' Atila Mohammed, who runs the Marrakech Express where the hole opened up in front of in North End Road, said he first became aware of the hole shortly before the incident. He said: 'A young man was passing, he came to me and said \"I was walking along and the pavement has broken\".' Mr Mohammed said that it was while he was checking the man was okay that woman, who was walking quite fast, approached the  hole, which at this point was only quite small. This is the first image that emerged of the incident on Thursday morning, taken by witness Kate Sissons . 'People were outside looking around and everyone said \"Stop, stop, stop\" as she put her foot on the pavement. 'I said \"stop, stop\", but I couldn't stop her. There was only a small hole from the man before, but when the lady stepped there she broke everything and it fell. 'I tried to hold her and she fell all the way down. But she's ok now I held her til the end.' He said he lowered her down the five foot wide by two and a half foot long\u00a0hole and she walked back up to the cafe via the basement and stairs and gave her a coffee while she waited for paramedics to arrive. The cafe manager claims he warned the council about the hole two years ago as he had noticed it was 'sagging'. Mr Mohammed said: 'We were shocked. We told the council nearly two years ago it looks like its sagging and they've done nothing.' Passers-by stop to take a look at the eight foot deep hole, which has been cordoned off since the incident . A cafe regular, who asked not to be named said: 'When we arrived about 9.10 all the police were here. 'We sit here every day and we were told that there was a large hole in the road and that the lady was running along the road, rushing.' The 76-year-old added: 'The cafe manager came out and grabbed her. She had a green coat and blue/black trousers, I heard. 'I thought the woman who told me was joking, but having said that there has been a big droop in that area of pavement for a long long time. I noticed it away back in February. 'I see elderly people pushing shopping trolleys along here - it could have been them we were all shocked it was an accident waiting to happen.' Laura Hill, 30, who lives in Wimbledon but works as a nanny in the area, walks up and down the road 'at least 10 times a day' and says it could have happened to anyone. 'It's an uneven pavement and a very busy area, with a bus stop really nearby. Lots of elderly people sit outside that cafe in the morning too. 'I walk up and down the street at least 10 times a day with the child I look after in a pushchair. When I heard I thought \"that could've been me\". 'It's all been boarded up now and you have to walk on the road to get past the hole now. People have been stopping to take pictures of it all day.' A London Ambulance spokesman confirmed paramedics were called to the scene at 8.53am after found the patient was 'shaken but not seriously injured' and took her to Charing Cross Hospital. Hammersmith & Fulham Council said that it is investigating claims that Mr Mohammed raised the issue with the council two months ago and the causes of the collapse. A council spokeswoman added: 'The council\u2019s structural engineer has carried out an initial investigation of the basement collapse in North End Road and secured the site. 'The freeholder of the property is legally responsible for the structural integrity of their basement but we are carrying out a full review of what\u2019s happened and will ensure the site is made safe and all necessary actions are taken once we have a full understanding of how this occurred.' She also said that the incident had not been captured on CCTV. Exposed: The basement door of the century old cellar at the Marrakech Express can be seen below . The cafe owner said he was made aware of the hole by another passer-by just minutes before Ms Flynn fell .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nLondon (CNN)It wasn't messrs Clooney, Pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a London vault during the Easter weekend. But last weekend's raid in the heart of the city's jewelry  district feels like it has been taken from a movie like \"Ocean 11\" given its daring and planning. Such robberies are rare: the gang didn't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in London for more than 40 years. In September 1971, the staff of a bank in Baker Street, central London, arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40-yard tunnel from a shop they had rented, hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room. The gang got away with a haul worth around \u00a330 million (the incident later formed the basis of the movie \"The Bank Job.\") But how are such heists organized? Roy Ramm, a former commander of specialist operations at London's Scotland Yard for 27 years, explains. In the UK burglaries and robberies are often committed by working-class people, people who would otherwise have blue collar jobs. In more than 25 years as a Scotland Yard detective, I never met a Raffles- or a Thomas Crown-style criminal from a middle-class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime. Sophisticated heists like the Hatton Garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break-ins. Many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar.  Occasionally, they steal things they can't sell and end up dumping valuable paintings or antiques when they are not able to sell them on quickly. More specialist criminals -- those, for example, who target museums or country houses -- will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash. Many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high IQs with a kind of raw street intelligence. One of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself, possibly from a source of inside information. Probably the biggest difference between any heist you'll see in a movie and its real-life equivalent is the motive. I've never encountered any criminal who committed a high value crime just for the challenge or to prove that it could be done. The only reason has been for the money, often to support a certain lifestyle and to fund other criminal enterprises. Inside information is one way of identifying a criminal opportunity, using people who are able to provide that crucial detail or who will participate in some small way to facilitate the crime. The Brinks MAT robbery in 1983 -- a case which I was involved in at the time -- saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than \u00a328 million (around \u00a388 million -- or $130million -- adjusting for inflation) from a warehouse at London's Heathrow Airport. The Knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of 1987 saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale London neighbourhood (the true amount will never be known). Both were made possible by inside information: it's an angle that London detectives investigating last weekend's heist will be looking at very closely. The planning behind the Hatton Garden raid will have been meticulous. The target will have been observed, perhaps for months, and the thieves will have decided on the right time to commit the crime.  A long weekend or a public holiday are occasions when more time may be available, also perhaps when regular staff are away. Sometimes the mastermind behind the raid will need a larger team of criminals to do a specific job. Usually they will already be known directly to each other, perhaps because they worked on other jobs together. Possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member -- but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding, so gangs in the UK tend to come from the same social and ethnic group, maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area. Even though there is more diversity in society, it would be unusual to find a broad ethnic or social mix in the team put together for a major crime. Vehicles will have been obtained, stolen or purchased for cash and their identities cloned or changed. Equipment will have been sourced. Everything will have been cleaned, cleaned and cleaned again to remove forensic traces. They will plan routes that avoid CCTV and timings that attract the least attention. They will have untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems. They will have planned their getaway, their clean-up and how and when they are going to dispose of anything that might link them to the crime scene -- and of course how they are going to sell on the proceeds of their crime. What criminals steal doesn't vary that much. Cash is probably first choice, followed by anything that can quickly and easily be converted to cash, like gold, jewellery and watches. The conversion of stolen goods to cash is risky and expensive: the Brinks MAT bullion that was traced was because it had been clumsily smelted and then sold on. Fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals -- unless they are stealing to order -- because they are so identifiable and because the black market is so much smaller. A painting may sell at an international auction for millions of dollars but it will only fetch a fraction of its true value from a dishonest collector. London detectives investigating the Hatton Garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement. But police enquiries won't stop there. They will look at every aspect of how the target business operates, then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited. The forensic assault on the crime scene will be immense. In recent years forensic science has made major advances in identifying trace evidence and investigators will look for any scrap of evidence that might yield the DNA of a criminal. CCTV footage from street cameras and from inside private premises will be analyzed and vehicle movements logged and cross-checked. Rewards for information will be offered. Witnesses will interviewed. In the police's criminal intelligence branch, the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear. The details of any identifiable goods which have been stolen will be circulated to known markets, both in the UK and internationally. The detectives investigating these major crimes in the UK see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism. They don't admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber. But the investigation will still be relentless.",

Even better, guests from all around the world can view the proceedings, as long as they have a webcam handy. Couples need Facebook accounts and working webcams. Once they log in, they can set a virtual date and invite the Facebook contacts they want as guests. The pair can then choose from a range of several ceremonies depending on their style. One wedding is their more high society offering, which is located on a city rooftop. One setting is located in the forest and involves cloth streamers in a fairy tale set-up . The beach wedding setting offers a laid-back atmosphere with white billowing drapes . The high society wedding is set on the rooftop of a city building with romantic lanterns . A more bohemian wedding is set in a wheat field, complete with quirky bunting . Another is a classic wedding, which includes a white layout and balloons. Another wedding is a bohemian setting of a field, complete with kitsch bunting and floor pillows for the guests to sit on. They also have a fairy tale wedding, set in the forest, with a more homemade feel and with cloth streamers. And - of course - the respective wedding settings are all decked out in IKEA's most fitting furnishings and decorations, all of which can be purchased at a click of a mouse. Guests are invited via Facebook, and once they log in their webcam streams are pasted onto a virtual body . Once the date is set, the couple are allowed a six hour session which is live streamed for guests' eyes only. IKEA monitors each of the 'ceremonies' for any inappropriate behaviour. Each of the guests fire up their webcams, and their faces will appear on virtual bodies sat in the guest area. Ikea underlines on the website that the online service can be used simply as a way of spending time with your far-away loved ones. But if a couple really does want to tie the knot they can make it a legally-binding ceremony, providing the couple, a marriage officiator, and two witnesses are all in the same room, to fill out the appropriate and relevant paperwork. That's romance.com. The service allows couples to share their ceremonies with relatives from all over the world . If the ceremony is to be legally binding, the couple, a marriage officiator and two official witnesses all need to be present in the same room, but guests can be worldwide .",

Mourinho says his problem is that he is not a hypocrite when he faces the media . The Chelsea boss said there was 'a campaign' against his side after his side's game against Southampton . 'There has been evolution in many different areas \u2013 the way I read the game; the way I prepare the game; the way I train; the methodology\u2026 I feel better and better. 'But there is one point where I cannot change: when I face the media, I am never a hypocrite.'",

Richard Curry, from Loveclough in Lancashire, was told he had malignant melanoma in his septum, the thin strip which separates the nostrils. He was warned that he would have to have his nose removed to stop the cancer from spreading but could be fitted with a prosthetic. Pensioner Richard Curry, who wears a prosthetic nose attached to his face using magnets, after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with cancer . But in order to make sure that the new nose stayed in place, the 71-year-old then had to have magnetic implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity during a procedure at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. And now Mr Curry has spoken of his shock at how successful the operation has been of keeping his new nose in place. He said: 'Losing my nose was something of a shock but I didn't have much choice because this kind of cancer is one of the most dangerous you can get. The 71-yer-old had a procedure to have metal implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity in order to hold his prosthetic in place . 'I ws just grateful it was caught in time and removed, and when they mentioned they could attach a new one with magnets, I just thought it was amazing.' Mr Curry's nose was removed in 2013, after he spotted traces of blood in a tissue, and the implants were gradually inserted of the course of the next 12 months. He added: 'In the early days I wasn't quite sure how much adhesive to put on, and my stick-on nose would sometimes fall off in hot weater, for example. 'And there was an incident in Asda which gave the girl on the till a bit of a shock. 'The implants were all ready last September and I was so pleased with the results. 'It's comfortable and it looks good, and I've even still got my sense of smell. 'I just need to get it touched up for colour every now and then, like before going on holiday so it matches my skin.' Mr Curry, a retired civil servant, who lives with his partner James Rogerson now wears his new nose all day but removes it at night when he goes to bed. A check-up last month found no signs of the cancer returning when he met with prosthetist Tony Simpson, maxillofacial surgeon Gary Cousin and ear, nose and throat specialist Paddy Morar. Mr Morar said: 'Cancers of the nose are not that common at all, you probably only get one every three years or so, so this was a very unusual procedure. Mr Curry's prosthetic nose, which is held on by magnets. Specialist Paddy Morar says it is fairly common to use magnets to attach prosthetic ears, but was the first time they had used them to attach a nose . 'Magnets are used quite commonly with prosthetic ears, but this was the first time we had used them to attach a nose. 'Richard couldn't have radiotherapy so it had to be surgery and we were extremely impressed by his attitude throughout, he's a very strong character and a model patient. 'It just shows there is life after this kind of radical surgery.'",

Jim Ratcliffe, founder and chairman of chemical company Ineos, has applied to planning officials in the New Forest to seek to demolish an existing beach hut and replace it with a 'carbon neutral' mansion. The 62-year-old businessman who is based in Switzerland claims that the new house, if built, will be his only UK residence. The proposed beach house in this computer generated image would only be visible from yachts on the Solent . The high-tech planned mansion will be virtually 'carbon-zero' and uses renewable energy such as solar power . Billionaire tycoon Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a futuristic beach house on a site he owns overlooking the Solent . The planning application claims the building will be 'climate-change proof due to its jacking system. The building has been designed by Charles Morris, who was the architect responsible for the Orchard Room at Prince Charles's Highgrove Estate. According the document: 'The development proposals incorporate domestic-scale micro renewable energy systems, including an array of photovoltaic cells, solar hot water and an air source heat pump. 'The solar thermal hot water system provides hot water powered directly from the sun; the photovoltaic cells will provide electrictiy to power immersion heaters to ensure that there is hot water in all weather conditions. 'The air source heat pump will draw latent heat from the air even when air temperature is as low as -25C to heat the house via underfloor heating. 'The dwelling would be so thermally efficient and would harness so much renewable energy that it will not need a boiler. 'The dwelling has been designed to be lifted by 73 piston jacks, with with a capacity to lift 25 tonnes; this will allow the development to respond to rising sea levels over the next 100 years, this is truly innovative and truly unique.' Mr Ratcliffe is seeking to demolish the existing house on the site and replace it with the new mansion . The house has a revolutionary jacking system which can lift the property up in the case of flooding . The \u00a34million luxury mansion will have stunning views of the Isle of Wight and is at the edge of the New Forest . Mr Ratcliffe bought the site in 2005 and has had several previous planning applications rejected. According to the plans, the house would only be visible from yachts on the Solent. His neighbours include Dire Straits lead singer Mark Knopfler and the band's bass guitarist John Illsley who live either side of the planned development. Graham Baker of the New Forest Association told the Times: 'Mr Ratcliffe bough a beach house, a small cheaply built occasional dwelling. He wants to erect a mansion in its place.' Mr Baker claimed the planned jacking system is not sufficiently unique to allow planners to grant the house permission. However, neighbour Frank Woodward, 89, who lives 100 metres away from the beach house said: 'This area was flooded a few years ago so I think it's a good idea. There used to be a much bigger house on that site. 'Mr Ratcliffe has got the money. He has to have a big house. People who are objecting have only been living here for five minutes.'",

With childhood obesity on the rise in the UK, these new figures are incredibly alarming. For more than two decades, I've been in the business of helping children get their daily fill of fruit and veg. So I wanted to share some of my feeding wisdom to help encourage healthier, happier children. It's easy to become locked in a battle of wills when it comes to dishing up healthy, nutritious food. Annabel Karmel has shred her tips on how to make children love eating vegetables . My son was a very fussy eater, so I had to think of ingenious ways to ensure he was getting a wholesome balanced diet whilst enjoying what he was eating. Truth be told, ninety percent of children go through at least one lengthy stage of fussy eating. It's so easy to feel frustrated and powerless when your child simply refuses to eat certain foods. But the key is not to give in or give up. Day in, day out, I persisted with new healthy foods, new recipes and creative ways to hide the good bits my son didn't like. In fact, it was coming up with these new and novel recipes that inspired me to create my very first book \u2013 Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner. While it can be frustrating when a child rejects the food we give them, it's actually the way that we deal with the situation that impact on their eating habits. It's not ideal to let your child get away with not eating certain foods in order to keep the peace. Giving your children a limited number of foods will only escalate their fussiness, and deprive them of the essential nutrients they need to grow and develop. If I am honest, hiding the good bits in a meal didn't always get past my children, but I found it really important to hide my frustrations. Instead, I gave them lots of praise when they ate well or tried something new. Remember, you are not alone! Keep trying out new ideas and eventually you will see positive results. Don't be afraid to quiz other mums on how they get their children eating healthy food. I used to share my recipes at my son's nursery and it felt so good to be able to help other mums in my position. Annabel says that parents should keep trying out new ideas with their children and eventually they will see positive results when it comes to a healthy diet . Tips for helping kids towards their five-a-day . 1. Try making your own healthy junk food using good quality lean meat for burgers, English muffins for pizza bases and a good way to coat homemade fish fingers is to dip them in seasoned flour, beaten egg and crushed cornflakes. For dessert it's easy to make fresh fruit ice lollies from fruit juice and pureed fruits. 2. Some kids can spot a hidden mushroom a mile off, so sometimes the best thing is to be up front about fruit and vegetables, tell them where they come from and why they are so good for you. Giving them facts could make them more interested about what they are eating. I used to offer a starter - a little teacup or saucer of something new that they could try that would be in addition to their main meal. 3. If your child refuses to eat anything other than junk food, don't worry. They will soon find there's not much point making a fuss if you don't react. 4. Without going to unnecessary lengths, try to make sure your child's food not only tastes good but looks good too. Make mini portions in ramekins, make chicken skewers or thread bite sized pieces of fruit onto a straw. 5. Avoid empty calorie snacks like crisps or soft drinks and keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand \u2013 maybe have a low shelf in the fridge with cut up fresh fruit and other healthy foods. When children are hungry, they won't wait. 6. Children like to assemble their own food, so you could lay ingredients out in bowls and let your child fill and fold their own wraps or choose their favourite toppings for their home made pizzas. 7. Most children adore cooking and tasks like squeezing fresh orange juice or cracking eggs are well within the capabilities of a young child. It's amazing how being involved in the planning and preparation of a meal can stimulate a child's appetite. 8. My chilled toddler meals are great for packing in the veggies \u2013 especially on those busy days. Based on my favourite cookbook recipes, they taste just like homemade and offer up to three of a child's five-a-day . Mini vegetable balls .

In an interview, the Lib Dem leader listed a range of reasons why different groups of former supporters are 'p***** off' and have deserted the party since 2010. And he said all those reasons were more important than any policy decisions he made including on tuition fees. Scroll down for video . Collapse: Nick Clegg has told the Economist there was a range of reasons why different groups left. Pictures: The Lib Dem leader on the campaign trail in north west England on Tuesday, April 7 . Blame game: But Mr Clegg has said none of them were to do with his policy making decisions . He was asked in an interview with the Economist magazine why Lib Dem support had 'collapsed' in the last five years. He blamed protest voters who supported the party but deserted it after it entered coalition because they didn't want to take any 'responsibility'. He also blamed the fact the Lib Dems had entered into coalition with one of the major parties. He said going in with Tories meant it was 'inevitable' that support would fall in 'anti-conservative' parts of Britain. And he said public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts. Mr Clegg said there was 'clearly a section of the support we had in 2010 that was virulently anti-Conservative'. Coallition: Mr Clegg said going in with the Tories meant they would lose 'virulently anti-Conservative' voters . Cuts: Public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts, he claimed . He said: 'They're the ones who still scream and shout blue murder and have done so without pause for breath for half a decade. And they're loud and they're noisy and they're angry. 'And that was a significant chunk of support that basically wanted to be associated with any party that didn't have the remotest sniff of power. 'There just is a constituency out there that wants to be entirely bereft of any responsibility. So they're clearly also very pissed off. It was 'wholly predictable and totally unsurprising' that public sector workers were at risk of being 'disenchanted'. He added that those factors are 'probably more important explanations than tuition fees, or this decision or that decision, although those obviously play a part'. Mr Clegg said some areas of country are a Lib Dem 'desert' and the party is now running a 'defensive' campaign focusing on winning where it retains support. 'Petulant': A Tory source has told the Daily Mail: 'This sums Nick Clegg. Its everyone's fault but his own' He admitted there are 'great parts of the country now where there is just no Liberal Democrat presence' citing the North of England and areas where they are fighting against Labour. He added: 'We're not going to waste any time, any effort, any money, any energy on places where we're not going to win\u2014which, by the way, is the vast majority of the country.' In 2010 the Lib Dems won 23 per cent of the vote but national polls in recent months have put them on single digits. A Tory source said: 'This sums Nick Clegg. Its everyone's fault but his own. He is like a petulant child.' Despite his party facing the prospect of losing dozens of seats, Mr Clegg used the interview to stake a claim for a particular government department his party would like to run if he is back in coalition after May 7. He said he would call for the Lib Dems to be given control of education, and criticised the 'fruitless and fruitcakey' policy 'spasms' under former Education Secretary Michael Gove.",

Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat\u2019s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning \u2018strange wing\u2019, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Su\u00e1rez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world\u2019s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning \"strange wing\" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don\u2019t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how \u00a0the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: \u2018As for gliding, if Yi qi\u2019s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. \u2018But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body \u2014 if the bulk of the animal\u2019s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. \u2018That is clearly the case in the authors\u2019 reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. \u2018Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. \u2018And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.\u2019",

But they do leave their trash. Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. \"Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,\" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. \"We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,\" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. \"There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip.\" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing \"in an eco-sensitive manner,\" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.",

Lawyers have warned that the differences in defamation law in Northern Ireland mean controversial US expose HBO's 'Going Clear' might not be broadcast by Sky Atlantic. The Alex Gibney-directed film, which alleges abusive practices at the religion's US headquarters, was due to premiere in the UK earlier this month to coincide with its American release. But the fact that Northern Ireland is not subject to the 2013 Defamation Act means Sky is set to postpone or cancel the show entirely, according to the Observer. Scroll down for video . A hard-hitting Scientology documentary slammed by John Travolta (pictured at a gala for the church in 2013) is unlikely to be aired in the UK because of fears that the broadcaster could be exposed to libel claims . This is because it could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists. It mirrors the decision taken by British publishers Transworld to cancel their release of Lawrence Wright's Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief, on which the film is based. Hollywood star John Travolta slammed the film and said his decades of personal experience at the church have been positive. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times\u00a0he said: 'I've been so happy with my experience in the last 40 years...that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative.' The documentary claims to have revealed secrets about the church of Scientology, pictured is headquarters . Lawyers have warned that the show could expose the broadcaster to libel claims from David Miscavige, the leader of the church, and other prominent scientologists such as Tom Cruise, pictured at a conference . The programme would be shielded by libel laws in Britain which state that people or organisations must now show 'serious harm' to reputation. But the same documentary would be\u00a0exposed to pre-reform libel laws in Northern Ireland because\u00a0Sky is unable to differentiate its signal between regions for technical reasons. Sky has maintained the decision is a delay rather than a cancellation. A spokesman said:\u00a0'At present, Sky's transmission date for Going Clear has not been confirmed.' The church has condemned the film as a 'one-sided, bigoted propaganda built on falsehoods' and informed by former members \u2013whom it calls 'misfits'. It is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast. The church said in a statement: 'The Church of Scientology will be entitled to seek the protection of both UK and Irish libel laws in the event that any false or defamatory content in this film is broadcast within these jurisdictions.' Going Clear examines the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, the church's finances and its relationships with celebrities such as Tom Cruise and  Travolta. Libel lawyer Paul Tweed, who was involved in previous discussion with UK publisher Transworld, which dropped Going Clear, said a decision to broadcast would be based on commercial reasons. The church is understood to have instructed solicitors in the UK to warn Sky it faces legal action if Going Clear is broadcast, pictured is leader\u00a0David Miscavige . Alex Gibney (left) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members including Paul Haggis (right) 'Any client of mine, whether a journalist or a high-profile personality, is entitled to protect their reputation against false allegations,' he said. 'In terms of Sky's decision \u2026 they have to make absolutely certain that what they are broadcasting is not defamatory or untrue. If they have right on their side, they have nothing to fear.' Going Clear has been seen by more than 5.5 million people in the US and is likely to become second only to a film about Beyonc\u00e9 as HBO\u2019s most-watched documentary of the past decade. In a comment piece in the Los Angeles Times last week director Mr Gibney said: 'In the past, critics of the church have called for its tax exemption to be revoked because it is not a 'real religion'. I agree that tax-exemption isn't merited, but not for that reason. 'The Church of Scientology has a distinct belief system which, despite its somewhat strange cosmology \u2013 mocked by the TV show South Park and many others \u2013 is not essentially more strange than, say, the idea of a virgin birth. 'Scientologists are entitled to believe what they want to believe. And the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] website makes it clear anyone is entitled to start a religion without seeking IRS permission. To maintain the right to be tax-exempt, however, religions must fulfil certain requirements for charitable organisations. For example, they may not 'serve the private interests of any individual' and/or 'the organisation's purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public policy'.'",

Brandon Afoa, 33, of Puyallup, Washington, was operating a tug to push aircraft at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when the brakes and steering failed, causing him to crash into a luggage lift. The incident, which took place at 2am on December 26, 2007, left Afoa unable to use his legs or right arm. Much of\u00a0his intestinal tract also had to be removed by surgeons. Afoa went on to sue Port of Seattle - which owns and operates the Sea-Tac airport - in King County Superior Court, saying that the company failed to maintain a safe workplace. Closure: An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago . But for years the case was locked in the courts because the Port of Seattle claimed it wasn't liable for what happened as Afoa worked for a private firm. In a bid to move things forward, the state supreme court finally ruled in 2013 that the airport had a 'duty' to provide a safe working environment. On Tuesday a King County jury awarded Afoa $40 million because of what the incident has done to his life. Indeed, the paraplegic needs round-the-clock help from caregivers just to survive. In the courtroom a panel was shown video footage of Afoa being craned from his bed by a special lift to a commode and undergoing therapy. Jurors went on to apportion 25per cent of the blame for the accident to the Port of Seattle. Meanwhile, a number of airlines which weren\u2019t part of the lawsuit will pay the rest of the money owed. This is because they had contracts with Afoa's previous employer - Evergreen Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprises - which has since gone out of business. Commenting on the outcome, Afoa told\u00a0KOMO-TV: 'It was a relief and I'm very thankful for the jury for making an awesome decision.' In a statement, the Port of Seattle expressed its sympathies to Afoa and his family for the accident. The agency says it's reviewing the decision. If it decides to appeal the verdict, it could delay payment of Afoa's award.",

From red walls to bright white lightbulbs and clutter under the bed, there are many things you may never have considered that are preventing you from getting a good night's rest. A new infographic from London furniture company Made.com shows scientifically proven tactics you can use to change the layout of your room. Sleep experts recommended you arrange your room symmetrically, install heavy curtains and keep pets out . If you're having trouble sleeping it could be down to the interior design of your bedroom . Sleep experts recommended you arrange your room symmetrically, install heavy curtains\u00a0and keep pets out to get a more restful slumber. You should also dim your light three hours before bedtime and stop using gadgets and hour before you hit the sack. Read on for a detailed breakdown of your step-by-step guide to perfect bedtime feng shui. FURNITURE ARRANGEMENTS . Ninety-one per cent of Britons say their sleep environment impacts their sleep. Though we often don't realise, our surroundings affect us in powerful ways. So arrange your bedroom to comfort your body and relax your mind. According to Made.com's tips below: 1. Install a ceiling fan. The ideal temperature for sleep is 18-21C. 2. Open a window just a crack to let air circulate. 3. Add blinds and thick, dark curtains to keep the light out. 4. Plush rugs and cushions muffle noise. 5. Create symmetry matching pairs. 6. Add plants, art or photos of nature and natural materials. 7. Eliminate clutter by investing in cabinets, drawers and storage. 8. Ditch the TV. Fill your space with something beautiful. We spend nearly a third of our lives sleeping. Yet many people don't realise just how sensitive our bodies are during these vital hours of rest. The space we sleep in has a huge effect on the quantity and quality of our sleep - and therefore the quality of our waking lives. After all, when we're not properly rested, our brainpower, digestion, reflexes and much more suffers. Better interior design really can help you get a better night's sleep. SLEEP EXPERTS SAY... LIGHTING THE PATH TO REST . Our bodies have evolved to respond to ambient light. Warm hued rays from the setting sun signal that it's time to sleep, while blue daylight releases hormones to make us alert. Now that we live much of our lives under artificial light, we must mirror these natural light spectrums to keep our circadian rhythms in harmony. According to the infographic, try shutting off computers, TVs and smartphones before going to bed. Make sure your bedroom is in complete darkness, and us low-wattage bulbs after sundown. Avoid blue lights and use lamps with warm yellow, gold or reddish light. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COLOUR . Just as bright red signals danger in nature, all colours have an impact on our psychology. So paint and decorate your bedroom in soothing hues for better sleep and deeper relaxation. Blues, greens and greys are said to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, and promote better sleep. But reds, yellows and oranges increase heart rate and blood pressure so discourage relaxation. PILLOWS AND MATTRESSES: BETTER BEDDING . From the way it feels on your skin to the way it traps allergens to the way it aligns our spines, bedding has a tremendous impact on sleep. If you're a side sleeper, use a firm pillow to get a good night's rest. But, if you like to lie on your back, a medium-firm pillow will promote the best quality shut-eye - for those snoozing on their fronts, a soft pillow is recommended. According to the infographic, the average person move 40-60 times during the night - and so it's recommended to change a mattress every seven to eight years.",

There is no point of trying to hurt him as he hurt because it can't be done. All we can do, all you can do is make the best choice.\" Bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from: death, or life in prison without any possibility of parole. \"We are asking you to punish Jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life.\" Showing the court a photo of the federal Supermax prison in Colorado, Bruck said: . \"This is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but aren't anymore. ... He goes here and he's forgotten. No more spotlight, like the death penalty brings. \"No interviews with the news media, no autobiography, no messages from Jahar on the Internet. No nothing. \"No martyrdom. Just years and years of punishment, day after day, as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did. \"The evidence will show that if you sentence Jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did, you'll both punish him and protect society.\" Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell, 29; Lingzi Lu, 23; Martin Richard, 8; and Sean Collier, 26. In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison, jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors, such as his relative youth, mental health and family background, and whether or not he is remorseful. He has shown no emotion as he sits in court, and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead. Last week, federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony, including an array of images showing the victims as happy, active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion, screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant, where Richard and Lu died. Lead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was 26, died in a gunbattle with Watertown, Massachusetts, police three days after the bombings. Clarke's colleague, Bruck, began that narrative in his opening statement by noting, \"The man who conceived, planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left. \"He was 19, nearly 20. But he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer. And an age when people make horribly bad, destructive decisions. What each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor.\" Bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing Tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point. \"I could almost hear you gasp\" when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims, Bruck said. \"It turned out that shocking gesture wasn't quite as advertised. \"What did he mean? It meant he was acting as an immature 19-year-old.\" Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend, but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives, who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel, apparently do not include his parents, who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15, 2013, bombings. Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang, a sociologist, to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed. Under federal law, the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life. The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Tuesday, April 14, is Equal Pay Day. Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make: . \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day . With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap . Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.",

Grown-up children who are still in their family home are living the \u2018life of Riley\u2019 while unknowingly pushing their parents into debt, research shows. The so-called \u2018boomerang generation\u2019 are placing their parents under serious financial pressure by living at home even in their twenties and thirties. Now, debt organisations have warned that parents should not be afraid to ask their children for rent and money towards household bills amid fears the British \u2018stiff upper lip\u2019 makes them reluctant to admit when they need help. Experts claim grown-up children still living at home are often completely unaware that they are forcing their parents further into debt. Research revealed that as many as three-quarters of parents whose children are over 18 still have at least one child living with them. But only 42 per cent charge their children rent \u2013 with many admitting they feel too guilty and uncomfortable to ask. And even if they manage to ask their offspring to contribute, most charge them just \u00a3150 a month, compared with a typical UK rent of \u00a3750. On top of this, 80 per cent still buy their adult child\u2019s groceries, and 60 per cent cook dinner for them each night, according to the study by website TopCashBack. Parents expressed concern that their children could not afford to move out or were struggling to save for a house deposit. But the survey found the average salary of a grown-up child living at home is \u00a326,000, giving them a comfortable \u00a31,000 in disposable income each month. Half of parents who did charge rent admitted they relied on that money to cover living expenses such as groceries and utility bills. Food for thought: Eight out of ten parents survey said they still bought their children's groceries for them . In fact, a second study released today revealed that many debt-ridden parents are falling into deeper financial trouble because of their stay-at-home children. According to debt management specialist PayPlan, a third of parents in debt who have grown-up children living at home have been forced to take out a loan to meet the costs of housing and feeding them. Young adults brought up on the internet are beset by loneliness because they make friends online rather than face to face, a survey reveals. It found many of the so-called Facebook generation of internet-obsessed people in their late teens, twenties and early thirties say they feel lonely. One in seven of those who find it hard to make friends are too scared to talk to strangers. Their fear of relationships appears linked to how they usually communicate \u2013 by text, Facebook and email. But unlike older generations they seem to have no time or inclination to talk to their neighbours. The survey of nearly 2,500 people by The Big Lunch community campaign undermines the idea that loneliness mostly affects the elderly. Dr Rebecca Harris of the University of Bolton, who worked on the poll, said: \u2018Our brains treat loneliness the same as physical pain. We\u2019re spending less time having social interaction, we have fewer friends than we\u2019d like and we\u2019re finding it harder to make new friends.\u2019 But half of these parents say they still refuse to ask their kids to contribute to the household pot. Jane Clack, of PayPlan, said: \u2018In this country we are renowned for a stiff upper lip, but the truth is that many parents are under emotional strain as a result of their debts.\u2019",

A 24-year-old high school teacher has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a male student and for providing him with alcohol. Kayla Mooney, who is in her first year teaching science at Danbury High School in Danbury, Connecticut, turned herself into police at 5pm on Tuesday. Her arrest came after the school's administration contacted police in February with the allegations and the Danbury Police Department's Special Victims Unit launched a seven-week investigation. She was accused of engaging in sexual activity with the boy while off campus late last year,\u00a0the News Times reported. Following the accusations, Mooney was also put on paid administrative leave on February 10. She is still on paid leave, according to the school district's superintendent. A judge granted police a warrant to arrest Mooney and she has now been charged with second-degree sexual assault and providing alcohol to a minor and was released without bail. Sal Pascarella, the superintendent of schools, sent high school parents a message on Tuesday to inform them of the teacher's arrest. 'We are all very disappointed that this has happened to one of our faculty members,' Pascarella said, but added: 'Obviously, there is a whole process we have to go through with this investigation. At this point, these are allegations.' School: Mooney, 24, is only in her first year of teaching science at Danbury High School in Connecticut . She is due in court on April 14. Mooney, who grew up in Danbury, attended North Dakota State University and Western Connecticut State University.. Property records show she still lives with her family in Danbury. She taught chemistry and physics classes at the school, the Danbury Daily Voice reported. She is the third area teacher to face sexual misconduct charges since February. The first, Sacred Heart University instructor Timothy Leonard, was put on leave on February 11 after allegedly sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in an SUV parked in a movie theater parking lot. Then a first-grade teacher, Brian Stroh, resigned from Bethel Elementary School on February 19 and has been charged with sexually abusing three children. He has been released on bail.",

Two care home workers who left a mute dementia patient in agony after she fell on the floor, then lied about what had happened, have been jailed. Ethel Rider, 87, suffered a broken pelvis and was left \u2018cowering\u2019 in pain after falling from her bed. But even though the grandmother was in agony, her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed. Because she is mute, Mrs Rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened. It was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance. The injury occurred because one of her carers, Susan Logan, had tried to turn her by herself \u2013 against the proper procedure at the private home. But when asked what had happened, Logan and her supervisor, Lauren Gillies, lied, saying Mrs Rider had fallen out of bed. Yesterday both were beginning six-month prison sentences after a judge branded them \u2018idle\u2019, saying they had cut corners to give themselves longer breaks. Afterwards the pensioner\u2019s family slammed the carers\u2019 \u2018disgusting\u2019 betrayal and said they were pleased both had been jailed. The Daily Mail\u2019s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted examples of poor care in residential homes and on NHS wards. Mrs Rider, a retired factory worker, moved into the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, near Manchester, where staff working in pairs were meant to turn her in bed every two hours. But on May 19 last year, Logan, 59, was trying to turn Mrs Rider by herself when the pensioner fell out of bed. Bolton Crown Court heard how it may have been some time before the emergency alarm was called and Gillies, 25, arrived to find the grandmother in pain and on the floor. \u2018She was left on the floor for 40 minutes,\u2019 said Jonathan Turner, prosecuting. \u2018She was then hoisted back into the bed. No ambulance was called and the story was devised between the two of them.\u2019 The court heard how Mrs Rider, who now has the mental capacity of a baby, is mute and would have been unable to convey the pain of being hoisted back into bed with a broken pelvis. Care workers Lauren Gillies, 25 (left) and Susan Logan, 59, (right) have been jailed for six months each . Logan, of Radcliffe, and Gillies, of Ramsbottom, admitted wilful neglect. Judge Timothy Stead told them: \u2018What you did between the two of you was outrageous. Your decisions have been described as stupid, but I would use a stronger word. They were criminally wrong.\u2019 Mrs Rider\u2019s daughter Julie Murphy, 52, from Radcliffe, said: \u2018I am satisfied they have been jailed. What they did is disgusting.\u2019 Four Seasons Health Care, which runs the home, said: \u2018We are very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family as a result of the actions of the carers.\u2019 A spokesman for the care home said they were 'very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nVirgil van Dijk believed he had sampled the worst refereeing decision of his career the night he landed an early red card against Inter Milan. Events at Hampden on Sunday forced him to revise his opinion. In the aftermath of a contentious Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the Dutchman found sleep elusive. The claims of referee Steven McLean and his five assistants that they failed to see the handball by Inverness player Josh Meekings which denied Celtic a penalty, a red card, possibly even a crack at the Treble, struck many at Parkhead as dubious. So dubious they fired off a letter seeking clarification from the SFA. Celtic centre back\u00a0Virgil van Dijk leaves field following his side's\u00a03-2 to Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi-final . For van Dijk, the collective burst of myopia was remarkable. A greater lapse on a wider scale than the red card he received from Slovakian official Ivan Kruzliak in the last 32 of the Champions League in February; a decision he described at the time as the worst he had experienced. Resting his arms on a table in a Glasgow hotel after being shortlisted for the PFA Scotland player of the year award, the Dutchman said of the Meekings flashpoint: 'Yeah I saw it. I think everybody in the stadium saw everything. It' s very strange that the right decision wasn't made. 'I was maybe near the halfway line. Even in the stands you could see it. It was a miracle that we didn't get the right decision. Van Dijk netted a superb free-kick against Caley Thistle but it wasn't enough to secure victory . 'This decision was terrible. I don't know \u2013 I've experienced some decisions lately. The Inter Milan game, of course, was terrible for my feelings. 'The decision on Sunday wasn't right and everyone can see it. It's terrible when you think about it . 'It was harder on my feelings (than Milan). I put the ref in a position in Milan to give me a red card (following his challenges on Rodrigo Palacio and Mauro Icardi) and that's what I have to learn from. 'Sunday's was a clear decision and it wasn't made - and that's a worse feeling.' Wednesday's 2-1 Premiership win over Dundee helped. It carried Celtic another step closer to the title and was recuperative. The presence of two Parkhead players \u2013 van Dijk and Stefan Johansen \u2013 on the PFA Scotland shortlist suggests the season may yet redeem itself. Josh Meekings handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it . Van Dijk is clear that punishing the Inverness player would have been futile and pointless. The blame for what happened lies, he believes, with the officials who created the mess and then closed ranks to insist they simply hadn't seen it. Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton has called on the officials to be held to account. But when SFA the freeze out their officials, it's done behind closed doors, quietly and without ceremony. 'I don't know,' said van Dijk, 'I don't think I can give my opinion on that. I want to move forward as well. We're not in the final. I want to win the league as soon as possible so we need to win on Sunday and move forward. My feeling is you shouldn't be punished for someone else's mistake.' Ronny Deila described the circumstances of the defeat to Inverness as the worst of his career. The Celtic manager returned home to stare at the walls while, for van Dijk, counting sheep proved an inadequate antidote to insomnia. 'Everybody was very down, especially after the game. For myself personally I was devastated, especially during the night, I couldn't sleep that well. 'That was the biggest chance to get the Treble and everyone at Celtic, and I think around Celtic as well, had the feeling that it was going to happen. 'If the right decision had been made in the game on Sunday we would have been in the final and we would hopefully have won the final. 'The Treble was very close. But it's not going to be turned around any more.' There are five games left now to change perceptions of the season. Celtic expect to win the league. With five games left and an eight-point lead over Aberdeen, they are almost there. Thereafter what transpires between Falkirk and Inverness in the Hampden final on May 30 is a source of utter indifference for the likes of van Dijk. 'I go on holiday so I don't think i will see it,' he said. 'After this season I don't want to watch any football. I've been the whole year watching and playing football and I have to be mentally rested for next season. I don't think I will watch it.' From the comfort of a Dubai lounger, he may give a little more time to his own future. Nominated for a second successive season by PFA Scotland, there are times when the Scottish game looks a little too easy for the 23-year-old defender. For the sake of his own development, there is the expectation he will leave Celtic this summer. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Meekings and award his side a penalty . Parrying questions on the matter, he insisted: 'My thoughts are that I want to win the league as soon as possible. 'We'll see what happens in the summer but for now I'm a Celtic player and we'll see if that is or isn't the case after the summer. 'It's an amazing club and you don't want to leave a club like this for one that is not as big. 'You need to know what you want \u2013 you don't need to lie. You have to be straight. I will be straight with everyone. 'I'm focusing on the present. You never know what will happen but for now I'm enjoying being a Celtic player.' His dilemma is clear. Celtic are a large club in a small league. Asked if a smaller club in a large league like England would be worth leaving for, he said: 'It depends on the club. If Celtic was playing in the Premier league then they would be one of the best clubs in the world and to stay here would be much more interesting than anything else. 'It is what it is right now. I just want to win the league as soon as possible and hopefully get a nice game maybe before we have to go to Aberdeen. Or maybe Aberdeen away will be a nice place to win the championship\u2026'",

But the timing was right for the gang of British comedians (along with their token American, Terry Gilliam), who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" their groundbreaking British TV series. \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" which premiered 40 years ago Thursday, was the result. The movie, a spoof of the Arthurian legend, did not start auspiciously. The budget was small -- about $400,000, half of it supplied by rock stars, including Genesis and Pink Floyd. On the first day of filming in Scotland -- the first shot, in fact -- the camera broke. The weather was bad. The hotel was dismal. Python member Graham Chapman was suffering from alcohol withdrawal. It got better. On the day of its first American screening in New York, a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. Thanks to the popularity of \"Python\" on American TV, the movie was a box-office hit, making $5 million -- more than 10 times its budget. More importantly, it soon became a comedy classic. The dialogue alone has been widely quoted, with such lines as \"It's just a flesh wound\" and \"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries\" referenced on shows such as \"The Simpsons,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and \"The Blacklist.\"  Python member Eric Idle turned the film into the Tony-winning Broadway play \"Spamalot.\" The troupe ended up making three movies -- well, four, if you count \"And Now for Something Completely Different,\" five if you include \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,\" five-and-a-half if you allow \"The Rutles,\" six if you ... well, three. We'll say three. Is there a best one? Where should you start? Let's break them down: . From its dramatic opening credits featuring fake-Swedish subtitles to the adventures of Sir Launcelot (\"the boldest and most expensive of the knights\"), weighted-bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks, \"Holy Grail\" is probably the loosest and most Python-esque of the Python oeuvre. As a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense, it falls short -- but as a repository for some of Python's best gags, it remains perhaps the best (and certainly most quotable) of the bunch. Besides, it features the word \"shrubbery.\" \" 'Grail' is a bit like 'A Hard Day's Night,' \" Idle observed in the Pythons' autobiography. \"It's got a joie de vivre that's very infectious, it's very hard not to like.\" Pros: The dialogue. The Black Knight. The Knights Who Say \"Ni.\" Cons: It's sometimes sloppy. And it doesn't really have an ending. Verdict: Better than a cheese shop full of ex-parrots. Probably Python's most consistent movie, \"Life of Brian\" is the story of a guy born down the road from Jesus who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified. It was a satire on organized religion, first-century politics and zealotry -- one of the best bits is the ongoing argument between \"the People's Front of Judea\" and \"the Judean People's Front\" -- but try telling that to the protesters. The film was picketed in cities across the United States, deplored by some religious leaders and banned in Ireland and Norway. (Sweden promoted it with the line, \"The film so funny that it was banned in Norway.\") It did have one huge supporter: ex-Beatle George Harrison, who mortgaged his estate to help fund the movie when a financier pulled out. \"He paid for it because he wanted to see it,\" Idle recalled. \"The most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history.\" Pros: Graham Chapman's performance as Brian. \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Cons: The adventurous but ultimately pointless animated-alien scene. Michael Palin's lisping Pilate (though, to be fair, it's so childishly broad you can't help but laugh). Verdict: Funnier than the Spanish Inquisition. \"Meaning of Life,\" constructed as a series of sketches, is the most uneven of the three narrative Python films. After the stunning opening sequence, Gilliam's \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\" -- about the revenge of some pirate-like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing. Even the Pythons thought so. \"The rhythms weren't right,\" said Gilliam. \"It needed a whole other rewrite,\" said Idle. Nevertheless, it has its moments: the \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" sequence, about religion, sex and contraception; the organ donor who's surprised by a demand for his liver; and -- of course -- the infamous Mr. Creosote, the absurdly fat man who gorges on a monstrous meal at a posh restaurant, regurgitates it at length, and is then encouraged to have a \"wafer-thin\" after-dinner mint -- with disastrous results. It also has the sweetest of all Python songs: Idle's \"The Galaxy Song,\" which is even more uplifting than \"Brian's\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Not a bad conclusion, given what happened to Mr. Creosote. Pros: \"Permanent Assurance.\" Mr. Creosote. \"The Galaxy Song.\" Cons: The fish. The schoolmaster's sex lesson. The fish. Verdict: More enjoyable than watching the Upper-Class Twit of the Year competition.",

The seal cull even takes place during the animals' breeding season - meaning that some cubs are being left to fend for themselves when their mothers are shot dead. Farmers say the seal killings are essential to stop the animals from destroying fish stocks off the coast of Scotland and northern England, but campaigners insist there are more humane methods of protecting fish. Warning: graphic images . Killed: This picture shows two seals shot in Crovie, north-east Scotland in an attempt to protect fish stocks . Shot: A seal killed near Blackpool; it is legal to cull seals without a licence in England . The practice of seal clubbing in Canada has long been regarded with revulsion around the world - but many Britons may be unaware that the animals are also being killed in the UK. Supporters of the practice claim that seals threaten farmed salmon, wild fish around the coasts and fish which are kept for sporting purposes. Figures from the Scottish government show that 205 seals were legally killed in Scottish waters last year by farmers, fishermen and angling firms. Some campaigners suggest that the real number of dead seals is much higher, as the official figure only includes those which were recorded to the authorities by people who had previously obtained licences. Fishermen have been given licences to kill more than 800 seals this year, although typically marksmen kill only around a quarter of the seals which can legally be culled. Trussed up: Two dead seals which have been thrown in the back of a van after being culled . Disposal: A van winches away the body of a seal after it was shot dead in Crovie to protect fish . Marksman: A gunman waits for the appearance of seals which could threaten stocks of salmon . Activists have called on consumers to more careful about buying Scottish salmon in supermarkets and fishmongers, encouraging them to investigate the origins of their fish. 'People who are horrified by what's happening in places like Norway and Scotland don't realise this is happening on their own doorstep,' said Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. 'The shooting tends to go on in remote locations, so it's not something most people tend to come across. Unlike in some countries, seals are not hunted in the UK for their skin, fur or meat. However, fishermen and farmer are allowed to kill seals which they believe are threatening fish stocks. In Scotland, they must get a licence which restricts the number of animals they can legally kill. But in the rest of Britain, there are no legal restrictions on culling seals, meaning people are free to do as they please. 'It's very simple - ask your retailer before you buy Scottish salmon whether seals were shot in the production of that salmon. 'Not every fish farmer is shooting seals, it's perfectly possible to protect fish without shooting seals.' He insisted that there is no need to cull seals in order to keep them away from fish stocks, saying that acoustic deterrents and strong nets can protect salmon just as well. Around three quarters of farms where seals are killed are certified by the RSPCA as 'Freedom Food' farms, Mr Ottaway added, saying that the animal protection charity should do more to crack down on the practice. He also called on the Scottish government to toughen up its licensing regime, which states that seals should only be killed as a 'last resort'. Mr Ottaway said: 'It's not the last resort if they're not using the best possible deterrents and the best possible nets. 'They recognise the value of seals as a tourist attraction, but have no problem with shooting them.' Threatened: British seal pups could starve if their mothers are shot dead (file photo) Protection: You need a licence to kill seals in Scotland but not in other parts of the UK (file photo) Because there are no restrictions on when farmers can kill seals if they have a licence, breeding mothers are likely to die, leaving their cubs unable to fend for themselves. Outside Scotland, it is legal to kill seals without any need for a licence - meaning that there is no way of measuring exactly how many die every year. The Scottish salmon industry, which produces annual export of \u00a3285million, insists that it is necessary to kill seals in order to protect farms. Scott Landsburgh of the Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation told the Daily Mirror: 'We have championed deterrence techniques that are designed to keep seals away from our fish, and shooting is always last resort. 'When a determined seal attacks fish in our pens it can kill and damage large numbers and it is important that we do whatever we can to reduce the chances of this happening.' A spokesman for the Scottish government said: 'Scottish seals are now better protected than ever before. Since 2011 it has been illegal in Scotland to shoot a seal except as a last resort under strict licensing conditions, and the number of seals shot under licence has more than halved since then.'",

It is perhaps fitting that Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots. Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance\u00e9 at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video .

Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison .

Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home.

All new inmates receive a paper bag containing seven pairs of underwear and a specially-designed razor and pen that can't be used as a weapon. Jerry-rigged weapons are something Hernandez should be concerned with, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hogson. Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said. Labor: Workers at Cedar Junction's prison manufacture license plates for 50 cents an hour - a far cry from the $40million contract extension Hernandez received from the Patriots in 2012 . The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma. And for a former professional athlete who's used to eating large satisfying meals, Hernandez may lose his appetite in the cafeteria where the food was once described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Cedar Point is where all male inmates are booked when they start their sentences in Massachusetts, so Hernandez will eventually be moved to another facility in the coming weeks or months, . It's reported that he will be sent to Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts next.

Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship \u2013 equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes \u2013 was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate.

Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over \u00a3390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just \u00a33.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels.

The prodigious pumpkins displayed at this year's show were cleverly recycled by being served to the Asian Elephants at the popular Sydney zoo. The prize-winning pumpkins - including a 728kg monster that was the biggest pumpkin to ever grace a Sydney Royal Easter Show - were presented to the elephants on Friday morning. Baby elephant Tukta feeds on a giant pumpkin from the\u00a0Sydney Royal Easter Show on Friday morning . Taronga's Asian Elephant herd, including 3300kg Pak Boon and calves Pathi Harn and Tukta, were quick to swoop on the record-breaking pumpkin. 'We're always looking for new foods and enrichment items to challenge and stimulate our extraordinary animals. The adult elephants were no strangers to pumpkins, but keepers were keen to see what they would make of the supersized variety. 'Elephants have many remarkable skills and environmental enrichment is a great way to encourage these skills and arouse their natural curiosity,' said Elephant Keeper, Steve Westnedge. The novelty sized pumpkins displayed at this year's show were served to the Asian Elephants at the popular Sydney zoo . Keepers introduce new foods and enrichment items to challenge and stimulate the extraudinary animals . Taronga's elephants are served a medley of different food items, particularly relishing fibrous palm logs and tough pineapple plant tops. They can eat between 60kg and 100kg in one day. 'When we saw the giant pumpkin in the news, we thought it was a fun opportunity to bring a taste of the Easter Show to Taronga and offer a nutritious and challenging treat to the Zoo's largest animals,' said Steve. The 728 monster, the work of grower Dale Oliver, was the largest pumpkin ever seen in Australasia . The record-holder had enjoyed pride of place at the Great Backyard Pumpkin Challenge in the Flower and Garden Pavilion at the Show, among 50,000 other pieces of fruit and vegetables. The pumpkins would normally be recycled as green waste after the show, but organisers were happy to see them served to some mammoth diners instead. This year grower Dale Oliver produced the largest pumpkin ever seen in Australasia.

The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports' annual\u00a0survey, and this year it was rated number 67, the second worst supermarket. As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine, Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce. However, it was noted for its better-than-average prices. Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports' annual supermarket survey . The retailer (above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama) came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum's, which was in last place . 'Every store I go in has room to improve,' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports. 'I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better. 'And if we nail those, one store at a time, our short-term performance gets better.' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness, food quality, freshness and staff courtesy. Walmart was joined by A&P (rated number 66) and Waldbaum's (number 68), which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed, according to CBS. The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts, which was cited by a quarter of respondents. Other findings included: . Source: Consumer Reports . America's favorite supermarket, taking first place, is New York-based Wegmans. The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness, baked goods and overall shopping experience. Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe's, Fareway Stores and Market Basket. Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers, including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market, that earned outstanding produce scores. 'It's going to sound clich\u00e9, but our employees are our secret sauce,' Jo Natale, Wegmans' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report. Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded, which 'allows us to take a long-range view, invest in people, and grow at a controlled rate.' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely  satisfied with the quality of their store's produce, meat and poultry offerings; nationwide, Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings. Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans, Publix, Costco, Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category. So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $5,400 on food, what makes a supermarket the best? The survey noted that those who were the 'freshest' stores were usually the best  overall. Wegmans (file photo above) was rated America's favorite supermarket followed by Publix, Trader Joe's and Fareway Stores . In the past, check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers, but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. They also want more organics and local produce. 'There's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods, especially among younger consumers,' says Willard Bishop's Jim Hertel.

Hamilton suggested Mercedes will be back in control for this race after Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the surprises for many a season with the team's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia. Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both practice sessions for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix . The Briton, mobbed by fans in the paddock, is bidding to win his fourth Chinese Grand Prix . 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:37.219 . 2. Kimi Raikkonen Ferrari 1:37.662 . 3. Daniel Ricciardo Red Bull - Renault 1:38.311 . 4. Sebastian Vettel Ferrari 1:38.339 . 5. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:38.399 . 6.

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari's success was 'a wake-up call' to his organisation. Without doubt Mercedes, and Hamilton in particular, responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team-mate Nico Rosberg at the end of FP1 when Pirelli's medium-compound tyre was used. Switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in FP2, Hamilton again comfortably had the edge by 0.443secs over Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest, 1.093secs adrift, but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues. It is yet to be determined whether they were the same problems that ultimately brought an end to team-mate Daniil Kvyat's day. As the young Russian exited the pits with 20 minutes remaining his brakes caught fire, and although Kvyat attempted to return, he was eventually forced to pull off track. Felipe Massa trudges off the track after his spin brought out the red flags during the second practice session . The Brazilian inspects his Williams after he locked up on the approach to turn 14 before losing the back end . Vettel was fourth on the timesheet, 1.120secs down, with Rosberg fifth after making a mistake on his fast lap on the soft tyres. Kvyat still ended up sixth, followed by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas, Sauber's Felipe Nasr and Romain Grosjean in his Lotus. McLaren's Jenson Button completed the top 10, two seconds down as he and the team continue to show signs of improvement, with team-mate Fernando Alonso 12th and a further half a second off the pace. Felipe Massa's session, meanwhile, lasted 38 minutes as the Williams driver skidded off the track at the end of the longest straight in F1. Daniil Kvyat's brakes caught fire when he left the pits and the Red Bull driver ended up in the gravel . Fernando Alonso looks on from the back of the McLaren garage... he ended the second session in 12th . The Brazilian locked up on the approach to turn 14, losing the back end of the car and resulting in a slide on to the run-off area where he lost the left front-wing endplate after clipping a barrier. Although Massa managed to keep the engine running and reversed his car, the endplate lodged under the left-front tyre, forcing him to abandon. It resulted in the session being red-flagged for the car's retrieval, with Massa ultimately finishing down in 17th. Manor duo Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens brought up the rear, the latter encountering issues with his power unit in FP2 which restricted him to just six laps. Stevens will be hoping the problem can be resolved as he has already missed qualifying and the race in both Australia and Malaysia due to other difficulties. Sebastian Vettel, winner at the Malaysian Grand Prix last time out, was fourth quickest in the second session .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nWaterloo, Iowa (CNN)Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb share little in common. Both Democrats are toying with a presidential run, both are facing long odds in that endeavor, and both shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night. But, as was evident at the dinner, that is where the similarities end. O'Malley is a former mayor and Maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand. Webb, on the contrary, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Virginia who comes across as more stoic and, at times, uncomfortable with retail politics. Before the event, O'Malley confidently cruised the union hall. He took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances. \"It is a marathon, not a sprint,\" one man told O'Malley, a nod to his long odds in the 2016 Democratic nomination process. \"Yes, it is; it's a marathon,\" O'Malley responded. \"Welcome to Iowa,\" said another man. \"We hope to see you here more.\" O'Malley smiled, \"Thanks a lot. I hope you do, too.\" Webb wasn't nearly as active, opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him. As Webb cut into his sizable helping of pork, O'Malley was standing directly behind him, shaking hands. The former Virginia senator, after possibly seeing O'Malley making the rounds, did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard Democratic activists in the room. \"Seven months old,\" Zach Smith, a new father, said of his baby boy, Noah. \"I have a bunch of kids. The youngest one is 8 years old,\" Webb said. The baby looked up at the senator. \"He is pretty calm,\" Webb remarked, himself calm. Despite coming from bordering states, Webb and O'Malley don't know each other. When they passed each other in a Des Moines hotel lobby on Friday morning, it was the first time the two had met. That said, the two Democrats find themselves in the same position. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid Sunday, leads every national and state poll of the Democratic field. She has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination. O'Malley and Webb are both looking up at her. In a March CNN/ORC poll (PDF) of national Democrats, only 1% said O'Malley and Webb were their top choice. In a January poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register (PDF), O'Malley was at 1% among Iowa Democrats, while Webb found himself at 3%. The speaking portion of the night further showed Webb and O'Malley's differences. Webb, who spoke before the governor, gave a more subdued, biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president: Basic governance, economic justice and criminal justice reform. To the approval of the audience, Webb promised to come back to Iowa regularly. \"I am committing to you right now,\" he said, \"we are going to go over the whole state.\" And the biggest applause came near the end of his speech, when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues. \"Money is ruining our political process,\" Webb said to a chorus of applause and \"hear hear.\" O'Malley, on the other hand, gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines. At points, the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands. \"When the American Dream is denied, our lives shrink, our hopes fade, and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear,\" O'Malley said, delivering the same stump speech he usually gives. \"To make the dream true again, we must fight for better wages for all workers, so that Americans can support their families on what they earn.\" As the event wound down, Webb and O'Malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people. O'Malley, who spent the previous day in Iowa, left Friday night for New York. Webb, who is in the midst of a four-day trip to Iowa, stayed in Des Moines and headlined a veterans event on Saturday morning in Waterloo. Webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event. He told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans. He also touted his work on passing the 21st Century G.I. Bill of Rights, a 2008 act that expanded education benefits for veterans, and stressed that more needed to be done. \"You want the next greatest generation, give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had,\" Webb said to applause. \"If you really want to thank them, hire a vet.\" After the event, Webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny Saturday morning. Asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, Webb smiled. Skepticism of retail politics is not new for Webb. As a one-term Democratic senator, Webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning, namely fundraising and retail politics. This time, he put on a rosy view. \"This is the good part of it, \"Webb said, with a laugh. \"Talking to the media, that is not always the good part.\"",

Consultant Peter Wilson told a BBC TV documentary Ashya\u2019s chances of long-term survival could have been halved by Brett and Naghmeh King\u2019s decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here. Dr Wilson, clinical director for child health at Southampton General Hospital, claimed the chemotherapy was essential to reduce the chances of the five-year-old\u2019s cancer returning. Scroll down for video . Clinicians in an \u2018impossible situation\u2019 as a result of King family\u2019s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors . And in an interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he complained of the \u2018vitriol\u2019 to which he had been subjected as a result of the case, saying: \u2018I personally received a letter from a person who said they wished my children got cancer and died.\u2019 Mr and Mrs King had accused the hospital of planning treatment which would have left their son a \u2018vegetable\u2019 and took him abroad last year for proton beam therapy, an alternative form of radiotherapy. Mr King, 51, said Ashya did not need subsequent chemotherapy as his cancer was in remission. Last month, four months after the proton treatment ended, the family said scans showed \u2018no evidence\u2019 of the tumour. But Dr Wilson, a paediatric intensive care consultant, said Ashya should have undergone chemotherapy within six weeks of his original surgery to remove the tumour in Southampton last July, and said it was too early to say he had been cured. He told the BBC: \u2018We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is\u2026 every month that goes by that he\u2019s not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens. The family then went to Prague for proton beam therapy, and now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour . \u2018There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival \u2013 so survival going from 80 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent, which is quite dramatic.\u2019 Dr Wilson said there was an \u2018international consensus\u2019 of medical opinion that Ashya\u2019s form of brain cancer should be treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After he had the surgery in Southampton his parents took him from the hospital without telling doctors. He was eventually given radiotherapy in the form of proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic, but his parents said the chemotherapy was not needed. They initially fled to Spain where they were arrested then released after the High Court approved their plan to take Ashya to Prague. The NHS eventually agreed to pay for the proton therapy there. Dr Wilson said there was a risk that tiny cancerous cells remained around the tumour site after the surgery, and that chemotherapy and radiotherapy were required to treat those cells to offer the best possible chance that the cancer would not return. The Kings were unavailable for comment but have said they wanted Ashya to receive the best possible treatment. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson said it was 'deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all\u2019 that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children .",

A 24-year-old high school teacher has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a male student and for providing him with alcohol. Kayla Mooney, who is in her first year teaching science at Danbury High School in Danbury, Connecticut, turned herself into police at 5pm on Tuesday. Her arrest came after the school's administration contacted police in February with the allegations and the Danbury Police Department's Special Victims Unit launched a seven-week investigation. She was accused of engaging in sexual activity with the boy while off campus late last year,\u00a0the News Times reported. Following the accusations, Mooney was also put on paid administrative leave on February 10. She is still on paid leave, according to the school district's superintendent. A judge granted police a warrant to arrest Mooney and she has now been charged with second-degree sexual assault and providing alcohol to a minor and was released without bail. Sal Pascarella, the superintendent of schools, sent high school parents a message on Tuesday to inform them of the teacher's arrest. 'We are all very disappointed that this has happened to one of our faculty members,' Pascarella said, but added: 'Obviously, there is a whole process we have to go through with this investigation. At this point, these are allegations.' School: Mooney, 24, is only in her first year of teaching science at Danbury High School in Connecticut . She is due in court on April 14. Mooney, who grew up in Danbury, attended North Dakota State University and Western Connecticut State University.. Property records show she still lives with her family in Danbury. She taught chemistry and physics classes at the school, the Danbury Daily Voice reported. She is the third area teacher to face sexual misconduct charges since February. The first, Sacred Heart University instructor Timothy Leonard, was put on leave on February 11 after allegedly sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in an SUV parked in a movie theater parking lot. Then a first-grade teacher, Brian Stroh, resigned from Bethel Elementary School on February 19 and has been charged with sexually abusing three children. He has been released on bail.",

Kim Ki-Jong has also been charged with assaulting a foreign envoy and business obstruction, the Seoul Central District Court official said. According to South Korean law, Kim's trial must begin within 14 days of receiving today's indictment. Lippert was stabbed March 5 during an event organized by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which advocates peaceful reunification between North and South Korea. Shortly before Lippert was supposed to give a speech, the attacker slashed him in the face and jaw. The ambassador suffered a gash from his right cheekbone to his lower jaw that required 80 stitches. That wound measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) long and 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) deep, but there was no serious facial nerve damage, said Dr. Jung Nam-shik of the Yonsei Severance Hospital. Lippert also suffered five cuts in his left arm and hand, but was not expected to have permanent damage to his arm function. Police said Kim stabbed Lippert with a 10-inch knife because he opposed the joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which happen every year and frequently draw the ire of North Korea. Police official Yoon Myeong-seong told reporters that Kim had visited North Korea seven times between 1999 and 2007, and that authorities were investigating a possible connection between his visits to the reclusive state and the attack against Lippert. Kim, 55, has a history of unpredictable behavior. In 2010, he received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese ambassador to South Korea, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korean President Park Geun-hye condemned the attack. \"This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador,\" she said, \"but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated.\" CNN's Madison Park and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub\u2019s Facebook page on April 3  - a week after Luke Lazarus was sentenced for raping an 18-year-old at the club. The 23-year-old privileged son of Andrew Lazarus, the owner of the venue in Sydney\u2019s Kings Cross, was jailed for at least three years for the crime on March 27. The photo\u2019s caption said: \u2018We\u2019re throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight \u2013 get amongst it!\u2019 Scroll down for video . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub\u00a0on May 12, 2013 . A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub\u2019s Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter, the Daily Life reports, with one shocked social media user complaining: \u2018This is how Luke Lazarus (sic) father promotes nightclub SOHO. Posted week after sentencing!\u2019. A Twitter user told Daily Mail Australia : \u2018Once it did Twitter rounds and people started commenting it was removed by Saturday.\u2019 A SOHO management spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: \u2018The event on the night was set up by an external promoter as a one-off event. 'He was given access to the official Facebook page but as soon as we noticed he\u2019d put that up it was taken down.' The club agreed that the photo used was \u2018100 per cent inappropriate\u2019. During Luke Lazarus\u2019s rape trial, the jury was told that the former private schoolboy boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway. During Luke Lazarus\u2019s rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' The woman attempted to go back inside in the early hours of May 12, 2013, but Lazarus forcefully told her to get down on the ground on all fours. In sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. On the night the teen was assaulted, the court heard it was the first time she had gone to Sydney's Kings Cross. The SOHO nightclub is a popular venue in Sydney's Kings Cross district . After entering the club Soho, Lazarus walked up to her, told her he was a part owner in the venue and showed her a business card. He then asked if she would like to enter a VIP area before taking her into an alleyway out back. They kissed but when she said she wanted to go back to her friends he said: 'No, stay'. He pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. Scared, she complied. During the ten minute assault that followed, the teen told him she was a virgin. The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter . The photo which caused offence on April 3 is in-line with similar photos posted the club's Facebook page . When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. He later texted a friend 'sick night, took a chick's virginity LOL so tight'. Judge Huggett said: 'It was her right to kiss the accused and it was her right to say she wanted to return to her friend. The offender ignored that.' The girl informed police the next morning who seized CCTV footage from the venue which confirmed Lazarus led the woman into the alleyway. Judge Huggett said Lazarus came from a privileged upbringing and had an inflated sense of entitlement and power when he was at the Soho. But she found he had good prospects of rehabilitation, was unlikely to reoffend and was suffering from an adjustment disorder due to a break-up in the weeks prior to the offence. She sentenced him to a maximum of five years in jail. He will be eligible for release in March 2018. Judge Huggett said Lazarus, a South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, came from a privileged upbringing . Lazarus told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement.' He also added that it made him physically ill to think that the incident was not consensual. The 23-year-old was allegedly seeing an American woman but ended the relationship due to his parent's disapproval of her not being Greek. Psychiatrist Dr. Christopher Rikard-Bell, said Lazarus was suffering emotional symptoms as a result of the break up. After Lazarus's sentencing a series of prominent public figures in the local community spoke out in his defence with character references. Waverley mayor Sally Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed his supporters, saying: 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice.'",

Courtois (centre) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a  goal for Hull on March 22 . Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull (left) but was back on form against QPR on Sundat . His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend. But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result. 'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said. 'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team. 'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen. 'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem. Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke . Courtois (right) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea . 'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy. 'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won. 'I'm 22 and still learning.

Mr Barr is a former chairman of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and previously served 10 years as principal of Scotch Oakburn College in Melbourne. Dr Seward told the Geelong Advertiser the investigation confirmed Mr Barr had not broken any law and 'at no point' did his actions affect the care provided to students. The Geelong College Council has since announced it has begun searching for a new Principal.

Deputies put out an alert for Schultz after they said he got away in a truck outside the home. William Schultz (left) was arrested Sunday afternoon, hours after Jordan Almgren (right) was stabbed to death in his home in Discovery Bay . Schultz was arrested at a hospital in Antioch at 3pm.

Officials didn't say what Schultz was being treated for and the motive for the stabbing remains under investigation. The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home (right) on Saturday on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz . Deputies were told on the police radio that the victim had been stabbed in the neck, reports the San Francisco Gate. The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz. Neighbors say five children lived there and it is believed Schultz may have been friends with one of the older siblings, reports ABC7. Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental . The\u00a0Contra Costa Times reports the stabbing occurred mere yards from the school the younger boy attended. Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental. 'This wasn't a random act. This wasn't some sort of stranger that came into the home and murdered a child. This was a family friend,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'This little guy was the most energetic on the team,' said Almgren's Little League coach Mike De Lambert told KCRA. 'Great smile. And he was infectious, in a positive way, to everybody that he came in contact with.' Discovery Bay is a waterfront community along the banks of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",

The Brazilian defender went off after 35 minutes of PSG's 3-2 win over Marseille after suffering an injjury to his left leg. Shortly after his side had fallen behind in their top of the table clash,the Brazilian was running away from a Marseille player, before being caught by a stray leg. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury . The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . The former-Chelsea defender attempted to continue breaking forward, but pulled up sharply holding his hamstring a couple of yards later. The club's official English Twitter account confirmed it was a muscle pull, tweeting: '@DavidLuiz_4 crumples to the floor with a hamstring pull #OMPSG' Reports suggest the 27-year-old will have scans on Monday to assess the extent of the injury. If it is serious as suggested then Luiz will surely be a doubt for PSG's upcoming games with Saint-Etienne, Bastia and Barcelona, whom the French side face in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on April 15. in his absence the French champions looked less than assured, conceding a second poor goal just a few minutes after Luiz departed, but they rallied to win the game and return to the top of the table with a better second-half display. Luiz limped off, and could now be a doubt for the Champions league quarter-final against Barcelona . PSG will hope their star defender can recover quickly, as he is a key part of their plans .",

With Lewis Hamilton yet to sign his new contract as he negotiates the finer details with Mercedes, it has been suggested that the 30-year-old will replace Raikkonen at Ferrari for next season. The Finn, however, has arguably never been happier during his Formula One career courtesy of the atmosphere generated within the team by the arrival of the charismatic Arrivabene. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his victory at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen . Raikkonen shakes hands with Hamilton in parc ferme after finishing behind the race winner in Bahrain . Last week Arrivabene urged Raikkonen to raise his game in the wake of an indifferent start to the campaign, certainly compared with team-mate Sebastian Vettel. In Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix, Raikkonen did exactly that, finishing on the podium for the first time in 26 grands prix as runner-up to Hamilton. The performance naturally resulted in Arrivabene being asked as to Raikkonen's chances of staying, given he has an option on his deal for next year, but also whether Ferrari were interested in Hamilton. Arrivabene said: 'Does Lewis Hamilton call you? Because he never calls me. Every driver here in the paddock wants to drive for Ferrari, this is normal, even guys that were quite a lot of the time world champion. 'I'm happy with the drivers we have, but this does not mean I am going to sign with Kimi tomorrow. Nico Rosberg duels for position with Sebastian Vettel heading into Turn 1 during Sunday's race in Bahrain . Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, celebrates his first podium finish since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix . 'We are very clear, I repeat again: I said to Kimi, 'Look, it depends on your performance' and he has demonstrated he's a great driver. 'So if you ask me now \"Does he deserve to renew the option?\" I am going to say yes. But if I am going to say yes, I don't want the driver to fall asleep. I want to keep him awake. Kimi is at his best when he is in a bit in trouble. This is a psychological approach. So the paper (the contract) at the moment is white. Sometimes I have to take the pen, then take it back.' Raikkonen produced his best performance of the season to finish second behind Hamilton . Although Raikkonen managed to split Mercedes duo Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, with Vettel down in fifth, it was not the result practice had suggested as Ferrari appeared stronger on long-run pace than Mercedes. Arrivabene knows Ferrari still have plenty of work to do if they are to keep pace with Mercedes on a regular basis. 'We put together an aggressive strategy, which is exactly what we discussed,' added Arrivabene. 'We recognise the gap we have to Mercedes, so the only way is to be aggressive, even though at this stage you can make a mistake if you are aggressive. 'If one day we are able to catch them, of course the strategy must be put together in a way that is a bit different.'",

A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to The Washington Post. \"The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her,\" and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he \"grabbed her arms when she resisted\" and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that  Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations \"very disturbing.\" \"Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. Earlier in September, an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched \"beyond its limits,\" needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. \"It's going to take time to change some of this culture,\" Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month. \"There's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain. That's going to take time because I'm going to have to build trust with our workforce.\" The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.",

Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. \"At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint,\" Jamie Davis said.  \"That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us.\" As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. \"At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known,\" said Troi Ge.  \"He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'\" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" Collins said. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.",

But while they have been able to put a date on when life appeared, they are still far from knowing how it appeared. Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still far from knowing how it appeared. \u00a0Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid, is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides. It is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life, along with DNA and proteins. The main job of RNA is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome. This prevents the DNA from having to leave the nucleus, and protects it from damage. It also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes. The researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. The study, by the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder, is based on a discovery in the 1980s that RNA can chemically alter its own structure. RNA is similar to DNA, and carries out a number of jobs in our cells, including acting as an on-and-off switch for some genes. Scientists believe that when life was in its early stages, RNA played a leading role in creating complex organisms before DNA and proteins were developed. Many origin-of-life researchers say that RNA chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions. The new study, however, claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in this way instead. The researchers found the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds. These connect together short DNA chains to form long ones, without the need for a separate biological process. The image shows a droplet of condensed nano-DNA and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left. The liquid crystal droplets act as 'micro-reactors' where short DNA can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life . 'Our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early Earth when the first DNA-like molecular fragments appeared,' said CU-Boulder physics Professor Noel Clark, a study co-author. The study suggests that the way in which DNA emerged in the early Earth lies in its structural properties and its ability to self-organise. In the pre-RNA world, the spontaneous self-assembly of fragments of nucleic acids \u2013 the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self-assembly. 'The new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions, the spontaneous self-assembly of small DNA fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers, thereby providing a pre-RNA route to the RNA world,' added Professor Clark.",

Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

Butland joined his England manager Gareth Southgate and former World Cup legend Michael Owen at St George's Park on St George's Day as around 35 local schoolchildren from the east Midlands were put through their paces by FA skills coaches at England's plush headquarters. The 22-year-old Stoke City goalkeeper is bidding to be the first England captain to lift the European Under 21 championship since Dave Sexton's team won the trophy in 1984 and Kane is expected to be a big part of their team as they attempt to end 31 years of hurt. Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland has reveled he voted for Harry Kane to win PFA Player of the Year . England U21 captain Jack Butland joined manager Gareth Southgate at St George's Park on Thursday . England U21 boss Southgate demonstrates a drill as 35 local school children were put through their paces . FA chief Greg Dyke has said that Kane's agent had called him to say the Spurs striker wanted to be part of the Three Lions team in June even though he has to go to Australia first for a post-season friendly with his club. On his decision to vote for Kane for the PFA award, Butland said: 'For someone who hadn't previously been given a lot of opportunities, he's been phenomenal. He's come out of nowhere and shown what he's about. 'He has constantly been 100 per cent driven and his finishing is among the best I've seen even though he is young. 'For me, there's not a player of the same age near him.' Kane took his tally of goals to 30 for the season with this strike against Newcastle last Sunday . Butland hopes Kane can fire the young Lions to European Championship glory this summer . Butland was part of the ill-fated England side that crashed out of the Under 21 finals at the group stages two years ago, though he did help the Under 17s win their European Championship in 2010. He said: 'With no World Cup or Olympics, it's a chance to grab peoples attention and show there is hope if you like and that there are good players coming through. 'With the incredibly gifted players we have in this country, we need to produce at a higher level. Players like myself, Nathaniel Chalobah and Nathan Redmond experienced tournament football and won it with the Under 17s and that should help massively. Kane has declared that he wants to play in the tournament in the Czech Republic this summer . 'It can bring a calming influence to the group, we will be able to to give a few words of advice here and there and give people an idea of what to expect.' It is unusual for a goalkeeper to be captain but Dino Zoff (1982) and Casillas (2010) led their country to World Cup wins. 'I dreamed of winning the trophy in the last tournament but it didn't go well then. The motivation has been even stronger to produce something this time as a team and do ourselves proud. Butland wants to emulate Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas by captaining his side to tournament glory . 'It has to be the dream, and to lift the trophy would be a huge honour. Casillas has done it, as a Spain captain he has lifted everything. Whether I was captain or not, lifting the trophy would be incredible.' England's squad for the finals will be announced on June 2. Their first match is on June 18.",

It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem \u2018irritating\u2019, \u2018annoying\u2019 and \u2018frustrating\u2019 and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad\u2019s Army and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC\u2019s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: \u2018Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? 'All because you can\u2019t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?\u2019 Another added: \u2018I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.\u2019 Shows such as Dad\u2019s Army and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes . According to the BBC\u2019s own figures, in February this year, 57million \u2018requests\u2019 were made for radio programmes on BBC iPlayer. Each request means a person chose to listen to a show. Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC\u2019s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: \u2018There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can\u2019t humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.\u2019",

Rangers will leapfrog Sherwood's side and plunge them back into the drop zone if they win at Villa Park in what represents a pivotal game for both sides. Ramsey, who was Sherwood's closest lieutenant at Tottenham last season, had at the weekend vowed to take the unusual step of trying to make contact with his opposing manager ahead of the game. Tim Sherwood  takes on his friend Chris Ramsey when Aston Villa play Queens Park Rangers . Ramsey (right) was Sherwood's ally when the the Villa man was at the helm of Tottenham last season . Sherwood's Villa team were swept aside by Manchester United on Saturday, losing 3-0 at Old Trafford . Yet Sherwood insists he will allow nothing to distract him from his primary focus of keeping Villa in the division. He said: 'I haven't spoke to Chris for a while. I keep red buttoning him! Have I text him to say well done (over the QPR result)? No. 'It's not changed. I hope he does well. I respect Chris as a coach and a manager . 'For someone to put is head on the block like he has, good luck to him, not tomorrow though. 'I hope we both survive. It's more likely we will than them because after Tuesday night we could be six points ahead. 'It's hard, what do you talk about? You can't share team notes. Only 'how's the family, are you alright? Ok, see you Tuesday.' 'He's a good pal of mine and very loyal friend but it's been put to one side.' Sherwood has guided Villa to an FA Cup semi-final, with Blackburn or Liverpool lying in wait on Sunday week. Yet he insists he will take no pleasure from their day out at Wembley if their they fail to get any more points on the board from their QPR showdown and Saturday's eagerly-anticipated return for the boss to White Hart Lane. Villa captain Fabian Delph looks dejected as Villa are beaten by United in the Premier League . Ramsey led QPR to a 4-1 victory at West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on Saturday . Bobby Zamora scored a stunning goal in QPR's big win but Sherwood claims he saw 'chinks in the armoury' He continued: 'I'm not even considering Wembley, it's not an option. 'It won't be a good day out if we don't pick up any points before now and the semi final. It's all about Tuesday. This is huge for us.' Sherwood insists Villa, whose mini-revival has been halted by back-to-back defeats, should not fear QPR despite them winning 4-1 at West Brom on Saturday. He added: 'We saw they scored four goals, we know they have got threats and two goals were contenders for goal of season. 'We saw enough chinks in the armoury for a Villa side to play well and exploit. 'We can't rely on anyone else, we know what we need to do, we know we have to win a considerable amount of games between now and the end of the season to stay safe and, that's what we intend to do. 'It's a great opportunity for us to put some breathing space points between us and Chris' QPR. 'It's about those players when they cross the line, it's time for them to stand up and be counted, have they got what it takes to stay in Premier League? 'I believe they have, they need to believe it and we need to start showing it starting showing it from Tuesday.' The manager has bemoaned his team's crippling injury crisis with Ashley Westwood, Scott Sinclair and Alan Hutton all sidelined. Ali Cissokho, Tom Cleverley and Kieran Richardson are also doubtful, while Philippe Senderos and Libor Kozak have been long-term absentees. 'I've never seen an injury crisis like it,' Sherwood added. Sherwood admitted his concern at Villa's injury list as he looks to lead the club away from relegation . Scott Sinclair heads Villa's list of absentees, with Alan Hutton and Ashley Westwood also missing for QPR . 'I never thought I'd be one of those managers who moans about injuries. You get one back and lose another two. 'They're not trivial injuries, they're always two, three, four weeks. It is OK in September but not now. That's pretty much writing off the season. 'It's a case of seeing who can come in. A few are back from injury, medically rather than physically, but it's a need must situation. Some of them will be risked.'",

Jamal Kiyemba, 36, was detained in the Ugandan capital Kampala in connection with the death of Joan Kagezi, who was killed in front of her children days before a major trial against Islamist terror network Al-Shabaab. Kiyemba, a former pharmacy student at a university in Leicester, who grew up in London, was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years and awarded the huge payout after being released. Arrested: Ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner Jamal Kiyemba, 36 was detained in\u00a0Kampala over the brutal murder of top female prosecutor Joan Kagezi . The 36-year-old is one of 16 former Guantanamo prisoners awarded a \u00a320million payout from the British taxpayer over claims of false imprisonment and human rights abuse. His case was championed by Muslim human rights group CAGE, whose director infamously branded ISIS executioner Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi an 'extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was born in Uganda as Anthony Kiyemba, but converted to Islam aged 20, changing his name to Jamal Abdullah. When the family arrived in Britain following the death of his father in 1993, Kiyemba, then 14, was granted indefinite leave to remain, but never applied for British citizenship. Kiyemba was arrested near Peshawar in Pakistan in March 2002, after allegedly trying to enter Afghanistan in the company of 'a probable al-Qaeda operative, a suspected al-Qaeda operative and a low-level jihadist', U.S. military files reveal. Compensated: Kiyemba was awarded \u00a31million from the British government over claims he had been tortured by U.S. intelligence and interrogated by the MI5 at Guantanamo which had violated his human rights . Kiyemba, however, claims he had gone to Pakistan to study Arabic and the Koran because the country was 'very cheap'. Following his 2006 release, he claimed he had only admitted to terrorist activities under torture by American intelligence officers and that he had been interrogated by MI5. He was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years but as he was not a British citizen, he was not entitled to representation by the Foreign Office nor, on his release, to automatic rights to return to his family. Kiyemba, whose mother, four brothers and sister all live in Britain, was instead deported to Uganda, but made several attempts to be allowed back into the UK. 'I may not be British according to some bit of paper but in reality I am a Brit and always will be,' he said in an interview following his release. 'My doctor, my local mosque, my teens, my education, employment, friends, taxes, home and above all else my family - it is all in Britain.' Support: Kiyemba's compensation claims were championed by human rights charity CAGE, whose research director, Asim Qureshi, pictured, famously branded ISIS executioner Jihadi John a 'kind, beautiful' man . Kiyemba was arrested alongside three others in a suburb to Kampala on Tuesday as a result of an operation aided by U.S. officials, Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said. Jamal Kyiemba is one of 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees paid compensation by the British Government over claims of human rights abuse. A total of \u00a320million has been awarded to former prisoners in an out-of-court settlement after they made allegations against British intelligence, the Sun reports. Others include Shaker Aamer, 48, who still remains in Guantanamo after 13 years without charge or trial, despite being cleared for release twice. Once he is released Mr Aamer, from south London, should be entitled to \u00a31million. Ms Kagezi had been a prosecutor in the ongoing trial of 12 suspects accused of being involved in the July 2010 bombings in which 76 people were killed while watching the World Cup final on TV. Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab, who were behind the brutal massacre of nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university this month, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this year, Ms Kagezi had been appointed Head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. Kagezi was shot twice by gunmen after she left her car \u2014 in which she was traveling with two of her children on the way home from work \u2014 to buy groceries in a Kampala suburb. After shooting her in the head and neck, the gunmen fled on a motorcycle, according to police. Ugandan police say there is not yet conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the murder of Ms Kagezi, but that detectives were questioning him about any possible role and about other offenses. Kiyemba has yet to comment on the allegations. Ugandan police on Tuesday arrested at least six suspects.",

Niloofar Rahmani, 23, has defied death threats from the terror group and even members of her own extended family to become the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and the first female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Captain Rahmani and nine other inspirational women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award 2015 at a ceremony last week. Scroll down for video . Captain Niloofar Rahmani, 23, (pictured) is the first female female pilot in the Afghan military since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 . Last week she and nine other women from across the world were awarded the U.S Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award . Captain Rahmani is the first female fixed-wing Air Force aviator in Afghanistan's history and has received death threats from the Taliban . She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit  pilots. Captain Rahmani said that ever since she was a little girl she had dreamed of becoming a pilot and spent nearly a year studying English in order to be able to attend flight school. She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant. She flew her first solo flight in a Cessna 182 and decided she wanted to fly even larger aircraft so she attended advanced flight school and was soon flying the C-208 military cargo aircraft. While women are traditionally banned from transporting dead or wounded soldiers Captain Rahmani defied orders when she discovered injured soldiers when she landed during a mission. She flew the injured men to hospital and reported her actions to her superiors who chose not to impose sanctions on her. When her achievements were publicised Captain Rahmani's family received threats from both family members and the Taliban, who disapproved of her ambition and career choices. She was just 18 when she heard a news announcement saying the Afghan Air Force wanted to recruit pilots and immediately applied . She enlisted in the Afghan Air Force Officer Training Program in 2010 and in July 2012 graduated as a Second Lieutenant . The family has been forced to move several times for safety reasons. But Captain Rahmani is resolute and says she eventually aims to become a flight instructor to inspire other women and in spite of the Taliban's threats says she remains determined to continue her career in the Afghan Air Force and work as frequently as her security situation permits. She is also deeply committed to encouraging other young women to join the cadre of female AAF pilots. 'You can't just see yourself as a woman, but as a human and believe in yourself,' Captain Rahmani told WTKR. 'It was not easy finishing flight school, it was very hard, but someone had to accept the risk so that other women can do what they dream.' At the award ceremony last week First Lady Michelle Obama honored Rahmani's bravery, commitment, and empowerment of women and girls in Afghanistan. Established in 2007, the annual Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award honors women around the globe who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women\u2019s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk. While she and her family have received death threats Captain Rahmani says it's her responsibility to be an example to the young girls after her .

Red is the overwhelming colour across the Football League in terms of the party that governs clubs' constituencies. The Conservatives trail some way behind, while the Liberal Democrats have only seven clubs in constituencies where they hold power. So if  May's vote goes the same way as the one in 2010, Labour would leave their rivals trailing in this alternative election. The Football League's political colours, based on the party holding each club's constituency . Ed Miliband (left) can claim that 18 of the 20 Premier League clubs are in Labour consituencies; but Prime Minister David Cameron may be concerned at the Conservatives' lack of Blues in the top flight . Football has long been hailed as the game the working man enjoys watching from the terraces . Overall, Ed Miliband\u2019s party has MPs in constituencies housing 55 of the 92 clubs in England\u2019s top four divisions. David Cameron\u2019s Tories have 29. Only one club falls into independent hands: Bradford West, which holds Valley Parade, voted Respect leader George Galloway as their MP in a 2012 by-election. At the top table, 18 of the 20 Premier League grounds are in constituencies held by Labour. Only Chelsea, who voted Tory, fittingly blue, and Burnley, where Lib Dems hold sway, are any different. The research, undertaken by Philip Cowley, Professor of Parliamentary Government at Nottingham University, suggests football remains the working man\u2019s game, so long as Labour is the working man\u2019s party. Both Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Arsenal are all located in solid Labour seats. Kate Green, MP for Stretford and Urmston holding Old Trafford, has nearly a 9,000 majority, while Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, the constituency housing the Etihad Stadium, has around a 10,000 majority. Liverpool Walton, encompassing Anfield, is represented by Steve Rotherham, who gained 20,000 more votes than anyone else at the 2010 general election. Steve Rotheram MP (left), of Liverpool Walton, the constituency that contains Liverpool and Raheem Sterling . Chelsea are one of just two Premier League clubs whose constituencies do not fall under Labour control. Greg Hands (right), Conservative MP for Hammersmith and Fulham, is the only Tory MP in a top-flight team's area . Kate Green (left), MP for Stretford and Urmston, which holds Manchester United's Old Trafford ground, where Wayne Rooney is captain of the Premier League's biggest and most successful football club . Five years ago Jeremy Corbyn won Islington North, where the Emirates Stadium is located, with a majority of 12,400. Chelsea and Fulham, holding both Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, voted in Tory Greg Hands with a 16,700 majority. Birmingham Ladywood is the only other constituency home to two clubs, both Birmingham City and Aston Villa. The residents voted Labour by a 10,000 majority in 2010. Alexis Sanchez (left) is the brightest star at Arsenal. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North . Lucy Powell (left), Labour MP for Manchester Central, can boast that Manchester City is in her constituency . Labour dominate urban areas, so their supremacy on football terms is to be expected. The Tories, with their traditional rural support, are not the natural choice of many living near grounds. Villa fan Cameron\u2019s Whitney seat does not include Oxford United\u2019s Kassam Stadium, for example. That is Labour. Nick Clegg\u2019s Sheffield Hallam does not incorporate Wednesday or United either. They are Labour. Miliband is MP for Doncaster North, but the Keepmoat Stadium falls in Doncaster Central, a Labour stronghold nevertheless.",

But there is now a good chance his final mount as a professional jockey will come in the handicap hurdle run at 5.35. AP McCoy has confirmed he will ride to the final race at Sandown on Saturday if he can secure mounts . McCoy's boss, JP McManus, has Jonjo O'Neill-trained Box Office in the race while O'Neill also has entered Champagne Present.
