Three-time winner Faldo has confirmed he will cross the famous Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory on the Old Course, having also lifted the Claret Jug at Muirfield in 1987 and 1992. Faldo, whose 58th birthday falls on the Saturday of the championship, said: 'The Open and St Andrews will forever hold a significant place in my heart. My fondest moments on my journey with this great sport are woven with pictures and emotions in this setting. It all means a huge amount to me. Sir Nick Faldo (left) and Tom Watson will compete at The Open for the last time at St Andrews in July . Watson will walk across the Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory there . 'I look forward to celebrating all that golf has given me as I cross that storied bridge and the wonderful memories I share with many people. I am grateful for it all and grateful to golf.' R&A chief executive Peter Dawson added: 'Sir Nick Faldo is an inspirational figure in British golf and has enjoyed a remarkable career in The Open. 'He has delighted the galleries over many years with his three victories and consistently outstanding performances. I'm sure there will be great anticipation among the galleries at St Andrews to see him play in The Open once again and he will receive a rousing ovation worthy of a great champion.' Five-time Open champion Watson, who lost a play-off at Turnberry in 2009 at the age of 59, received a special exemption from the R&A to play his final Open in 2015, the 40th anniversary of his first victory at Carnoustie. He and Faldo will be joined by the likes of Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson in the Champion Golfers' Challenge on Wednesday, July 15, a four-hole team event played on the first, second, 17th and 18th on the eve of the championship. Almost 10,000 spectators will be able to watch from seats on the first, 17th and 18th, with a two-tiered grandstand created behind the 18th green for the first time and an L-shaped arena behind the 17th green, as well as the traditional seats to the right of the first. The grandstand behind the famous Road Hole will have a capacity of more than 4,000, with a total of 21,000 seats around the entire course. Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, executive director of championships at the R&A, said: 'There is always an incredible atmosphere at The Open and particularly when it is held in St Andrews. We want to make sure as many spectators as possible can experience that unique atmosphere and enjoy wonderful views of the play on the opening and closing holes at St Andrews. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson paid tribute to the achievements of Faldo during his career . Tom Watson (right) poses with the Claret Jug alongside runner-up in 1975, Jack Newton (left) Rory McIlroy is the current holder of the Claret Jug and will defend the title at St Andrews this year . 'The new arena will provide a fantastic setting for the climax of the Championship at the 72nd hole and will be the ideal place for spectators to greet the new champion golfer of the year.' Several cameras have been implanted into bunkers on the course, with another 'turf camera' giving views of the R&A clubhouse from in front of the first tee. The R&A has also invested \u00a3150,000 in subsidising food and drink prices, meaning the price of fish and chips, for example, is down from \u00a310.50 to \u00a38.50.",

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Last year: Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt last November \u00a0after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game against Hiram University . Never give up: Lauren, picture on March 22, is vowing to never give up her battle with rare brain cancer . A team player: Lauren is working with her doctors and family to fight the disease that will likely kill her . Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center at hospital) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain .",

Jessa, 22, and her 19-year-old husband Ben   announced the\u00a0the news of their pregnancy ina video for\u00a0TLC.com, which featured them both\u00a0making health smoothies, and Jessa has revealed that one of the first things the couple considered after hearing the news was how to adjust her workouts accordingly, to ensure that she can remain fit and active while expecting. Speaking to People magazine, the reality star explained that when it comes to exercising: 'I'm just trying not to overdo it right now. I am still working out, but not trying to break any records. Scroll down for video . Expecting: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald recently revealed that she is pregnant with their first child . Announcement: The baby is due on November 1, which is also the date of Ben and Jessa's first wedding anniversary . 'I want to gain a little less weight and not stress out about it. I do want to make sure that I'm eating healthy. You are eating for two but the other is, like, a speck. I am trying to make healthy choices now that I'm entering my second trimester.' The pair, who married after a chaste courtship, are well-known for their health-conscious lifestyle and are often seen on the Duggars\u2019 hit reality series enjoying healthy dinners or working out together, something which viewers saw frequently during the build-up to the couple\u2019s wedding, during which time Jessa was incredibly keen to trim down her already-toned physique. A recent episode of the show even saw Jessa pushing Ben's truck down the road while wearing workout pants covered with knee-length skirts to maintain their 'standard of modesty'. Jessa also frequently posts recipes and photos of healthy foods she's trying out on Instagram. Juiced up: Jessa and Ben are both champions of healthy eating, and even announced their pregnancy in an adorable video while making smoothies . Push it along: While getting ready for her wedding, Jessa stepped up her workout, part of which involved pushing her fiance's truck down a dirt road with her siblings inside . Interesting attire: The women in the religious Duggar family wear skirts over their workout pants to maintain their 'standard of modesty' As for her pregnancy diet, when Jessa discovered the news, she said that she thought she would take after other Duggar mothers when it came to her pregnancy cravings, but admitted that this hasn\u2019t been the case. 'I am feeling pretty good,' she added to People. 'I thought I'd crave pickles and lemons because my mother did, but I couldn't stand them. 'I'm hoping I'm having triplets because I've been eating so much!' However, Jessa does admit she will be looking to her older sister Jill for advice, as the 23-year-old just welcomed a son Israel with husband Derick Dillard on April 6, and is also a trained midwife. Jill kept up her exercise during the later months of pregnancy by\u00a0walking on the treadmill while listening to sermons. 70 hours later: Jessa's sister Jill Dillard (pictured) welcomed her son Israel on April 6 with her husband Derick after almost three full days of labor . Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c) Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.",

And when he was asked about whether he understood the decision, Isco was forthright in his criticism of Carlo Ancelotti's choice.

Isco returned to the starting XI for the second leg of the Madrid derby in the quarter-finals, as injuries to Gareth Bale and Luka Modric forced Ancelotti into a change of system. But it is not clear whether he can tie down a place long term in a team that features Cristiano Ronaldo, Bale, Rodriguez, Modric and Toni Kroos.

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

Derek Skyler Brux, 22, pleaded guilty in January for unhitching a pair of locomotives and going on a high-speed run 13 miles down one of the busiest lines of track in the country. Brux then crashed into an inactive Union Pacific train at 10mph before backing up and then hitting it again. Derek Skyler Brux, 22, was sentenced to five years probation for taking a train from a coal mine and crashing it into another train last fall. He must also pay $63,000 in restitution to Rail Link, his employer . He was preparing to hit the train a third time when a Rail Link employee was able to get on the engine train and press the fuel cut-off switch, according to K2 Radio. Brux was working at his job at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine, where he had been employed as a utility coal operator for three years, when he received the phone call that upset him on October 9. The details of what exactly his supervisor said were not included in available court documents. During the sentencing on Friday, U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl told Brux he needed to deal with his anger and mental health issues. Brux's public defender David Weiss previous told the court his client had struggled with bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the past. But Brux was able to avoid prison time and instead must serve five years of probation. He also must pay over $63,000 in restitution to Rail Link. Brux pleaded guilty to unhitching two locomotives (pictured) and going on a high-speed run 13 miles down one of the busiest lines of track in the country .",

His views were echoed, more robustly, by commentators and fans alike. That might not be the end of the short-term Kiwi exodus, despite Jerome Kaino\u2019s decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the Lions in 2017. Charles Piutau rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast . Fly-half Colin Slade is thought to be deciding between a move to Toulon or Pau in France \u2013 while the latter club have already landed Conrad Smith. The prospect of piles of Euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the Top 14 league the destination du jour, for southern stars seeking a stint abroad. What makes the Piutau deal so eye-catching is that it is a bold endorsement of Ulster\u2019s ambition and also a boost to the wider Celtic game, below Test level. That boost is much-needed, because there are simmering problems \u2013 as exposed and bemoaned by Leinster\u2019s head coach Matt O\u2019Connor last weekend. The Australian was infuriated by the softly-softly stance of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose final say on release of Test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the Pro 12 clash with leaders Glasgow. Alun Wyn Jones can put his body on the line for\u00a0Ospreys and Wales . \u2018It hurts the league,\u2019 said the Australian, which is absolutely true. The Pro 12 has a credibility issue, due to the continuing absence of so many Irish stars from so many matches. While player welfare is quite rightly prioritised, there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions. No wonder the Welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the Aviva Premiership clubs during the European rebellion last year. A leading figure such as Alun Wyn Jones gives body and soul to the Ospreys week after week, but still found the energy to face down the more rested Irish in Cardiff during the Six Nations. He and so many others in Wales would enhance the Premiership. If the Irish cannot fully commit to a league \u2013 making it a fitting stage for Piutau\u2019s class \u2013 they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for European combat with their provinces. Scrap the LV Cup and bring the regions into an expanded Premiership. Job done. Wasps forward Hughes\u00a0was clumsy, not reckless . Wasps players were incensed by the three-game ban handed to their No 8, Nathan Hughes, for the collision which left George North unconscious last Friday night, and their angst is understandable. The big Fijian was clumsy, but no more, by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the Lions wing, as he scored a try. Nathan Hughes\u00a0was clumsy rather than\u00a0reckless and didn't deserve a three-game ban . The disciplinary panel called the offence \u2018reckless\u2019 and the reaction of Wasps captain James Haskell was priceless. \u2018Rugby is reckless,\u2019 he said. \u2018The whole game is reckless. If you\u2019re going to worry about that\u2026 maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch.\u2019 The England flanker had a point. The sport is founded on physicality and danger. A player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated, damaging contact, however accidental, but the suspicion lingers that Hughes is serving a ban because North was knocked out. If the scorer had jumped up and walked off, it\u2019s fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed. Fill World Cup seats or face fan fury . Is anyone really surprised that trying to buy World Cup tickets is such a drawn-out ordeal? For those without the benefit of a corporate invite (or a media pass, before anyone pipes up), securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of root-canal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket. The Webb Ellis Cup visits a school in Toronto as part of the Rugby World Cup Trophy Tour . We are in the cost-cutting age of do-it-all-online, so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on Monday. At least the old-fashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit, as so wonderfully evident at Wimbledon tennis down the years. Ultimately, the World Cup will be a sell-out, but organisers better be right when they say there won\u2019t be the empty seats which blighted the Olympics. As if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough, those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of well-heeled \u2018guests\u2019 can\u2019t be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena, or even turn up at all. Signing Sinfield is an inspired move . It\u2019s been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt, which is harsh on all concerned. Kevin Sinfield is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in Leeds later this year, from the Rhinos to Yorkshire Carnegie. Yorkshire Carnegie's signing of rugby league legend\u00a0Kevin Sinfield is a statement of intent . He wants to play fly-half and while the prospect of him igniting the Championship at the age of 34 is far-fetched, he is a proven leader and winner, and his mentality is what the union side at Headingley are keen to tap into. No doubt, he\u2019ll bring a few more through the turnstiles, too, but coach Bryan Redpath will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him. It is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation, Leeds are another second-tier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile. Last Word . Team GB, under the auspices of England, face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the Olympic Sevens tournament in Rio. In Hong Kong last weekend, Simon Amor\u2019s side \u2013 nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of Great Britain, ahead of Wales and Scotland \u2013 lost further ground to Australia and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings, one below the final qualification slot. This weekend in Tokyo, they must try to catch their rivals from Down Under, but they have been drawn in a pool with Fiji, who won in Hong Kong and are second in the rankings behind South Africa. Realistically, one Olympic place is up for grabs, behind those nations and New Zealand, and England\u2019s advantage is that the series culminates at Twickenham next month. Sadly, Team GB\u2019s preparations \u2013 complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby \u2013 have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight, and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThey gave us sanitation, wine, aqueducts and roads, but it seems the Romans also gave us one more addition to the list - tuberculosis. Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of V\u00e1c in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Ter\u00e9zia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by \u2018new\u2019 diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of V\u00e1c's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria\u00a0Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second\u2013fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in\u00a0V\u00e1c in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'",

Scroll down and you'll eventually find your first female face: none other than Barbie, 'CEO Barbie' to be precise, a doll which first appeared in the Eighties, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase. The image of Barbie is the 96th result on the page, and ironically comes from a 2005 spoof article courtesy of The Onion that jokingly states 'women don't run companies'. Spot the stereotype! Barbie is the 96th image to come up on Google Images when you enter the search term 'CEO', after rows and rows of grinning suit-clad men . Several high-powered women, including women's right campaigner Chelsea Clinton, have re-tweeted the results of the search, which is being seen by many as a sad reflection on the general state of women in the workplace. Google, like other search engines, generates images based on a knot of complex algorithms related to file names and key words. The more 'popular' and relevant an image is, the higher up the ranks it will move. After Barbie, the next female - and the first human one - you'll find upon searching Google Images for 'CEO' doesn't pop up until several lines more of men, and is Jessica Herrin, CEO of a jewellery company called Stella & Dot. Incidentally, a new study from the University of Washington recently found that results like these are indeed contributing to gender bias, and perpetuating outdated views on women in the workplace. Shining example? The image (pictured) is of 'CEO Barbie', a doll which first appeared in the 80s, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase . Noted: Chelsea Clinton was one of the many high-powered women to retweet the results of the search . The study concluded: 'Manipulated image search results could determine, on average, seven per cent of a study participant\u2019s subsequent opinion about how many men and women work in a particular field.' Earlier this year, it was determined by the Professional Boards Forum\u2019s BoardWatch that for the first time ever, the proportion of women on FTSE 500 boards in the UK had reached 20 per cent. Of the images returned by Google from a 'CEO' search, only 11 per cent were of women. And unlike most scenarios concerning gender inequality, nothing is to blame here but a set of internet algorithms. Funny side: One Twitter user deemed the phenomenon 'hilarious' In a nutshell: The Atlantic pointed out that Google Images' definition of a CEO was 'mostly white guys and Barbie' Misrepresentation: Others hinted that the results were woefully out-of-date .",

The 16-year-old was expected to be given some minutes towards the end of the game if Carlo Ancelotti's side were in a commanding lead against the relegation-threatened club at the Bernabeu.

Odegaard takes his place on the bench alongside regular first team player Isco . The Norway international shows off some of his skills during the warm-up . Odegaard will become Real Madrid's youngest player in the club's history if he comes on . Odegaard, who is already a full international for Norway, does not turn 17 until December and at 16 years and 133 days would have become the youngest player in Real Madrid's illustrious history. The former Stromgodset midfielder was joined on the bench by fellow promising youngster Borja Mayoral, an 18-year-old striker who has scored more than 40 goals for Real's Under 18 team, as Ancelotti contends with an injury list and a packed schedule. Odegaard has struggled to settle in the Real Madrid Castilla team and was dropped by coach Zinedine Zidane last month and there is a feeling that he has already outgrown the B team. Odegaard joined the Champions League winners in January for an initial \u00a32million fee as the Spanish giants fought off competition for his from just about every major club in Europe.

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.' It is not known whether Gywneth's two children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, ten, and Moses, nine, will also be taking part in the challenge however, given the limited supply of food featured in her Twitter picture, it is thought the Shakespeare in Love star is going it alone this time around.",

Twelve of the cases resulted in the pilots requesting a priority landing, one flight was diverted and on two flights the pilots made an emergency Mayday call. Among the worst cases, one incident report in February noted: \u2018Fumes in cabin. Eleven of the cabin crew became unwell during flight, with symptoms of light-headedness, nausea and \u201csea sickness\u201d. Oxygen administered. Aircraft returned.\u2019 Victim? It is suspected British Airways pilot Richard Westgate, who died in 2012, had Aerotoxic Syndrome . The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe for passengers and crew. Details emerged in a report broadcast last night by ITV News, which has seen copies of the Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s safety reports from December 2014 to March 2015. These reveal 167 cases of fumes or smoke in the cabin, not attributable to faulty ovens, coffee brewers or toilets. In February a coroner warned that airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins. Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes. He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012. The 43-year-old, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, had suffered years of persistent headaches, nausea and chronic fatigue, which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits. Mr Payne\u2019s warning came days after the Daily Mail revealed how the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes had sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years. The coroner\u2019s intervention was the first official recognition of Aerotoxic Syndrome, thought to be linked to memory loss, tremors, lethargy, headaches, tinnitus, confusion, breathing difficulties and even death. Safety questions: Pilots have reported 167 cases of toxic cabin fumes or smoke in only four months. The figures have re-opened the argument about whether prolonged exposure to the air in planes is safe . Warning: Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne said pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of those travelling on planes. It followed initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate . Many former pilots, co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have suffered long-term illnesses because of the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and \u2018toxic fumes\u2019. The pilots\u2019 union BALPA has raised concerns. Since 1999, the air industry has denied a link between \u2018fume events\u2019 and medical problems. But a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous. The problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines. Passengers are usually isolated from this \u2018bleed air\u2019 \u2013 but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called \u2018organophosphates\u2019. In small quantities, these compounds may not be harmful \u2013 campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff. The Civil Aviation Authority said several expert studies on cabin air quality have been carried out in recent years. \u2018The overall conclusion has been that there is no positive evidence of a link between exposure to contaminants in cabin air and possible long-term health effects \u2013 although such a link cannot be excluded,\u2019 it added. \u2018Passenger and crew safety is of paramount importance to the CAA and we are constantly working to enhance safety standards.\u2019",

Marking her answers with red pen, she scored an impressive 43.5 out of 50, to which he commented, 'Well done Saskia! As a result, I will not be dumping you! (Lucky you)'. Saskia posted snaps of the test to her Twitter account, @saskiaisabxlla, commenting 'Boyfriend made me take an @Arsenal exam!' with emoticons showing she didn't know whether to laugh or cry. We don't blame her. Saskia's football fan boyfriend made her take an Arsenal test and didn't dump her thanks to her A grade . The test took the form of a school exam, with multiple choice questions, tables to complete, and 'in your own words...' section. There were even 'helpful' instructions including 'Read every question at least twice' and 'Check your answers if you have time at the end'. Oh, and 'calculators may be used'. Saskia scored an impressive 87 per cent, but according to her unnamed boyfriend's feedback she 'could have performed better on Q17', needs to 'Learn ALL player positions' and should understand that 'Tottenham are scum'. What does the 'FC' in Arsenal FC stand for? What is the nickname for Arsenal fans? Who is the current manager of Arsenal? Is the kit below (see picture) Arsenal#s current Home kit or Away kit? Name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions. In your own words, explain why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard. Who are our top 2 goalscorers of the season so far?

What player scored the winning goal in the 204 FA Cup Final? a) Olivier Giroud . b) Santi Cazorla . c) Aaron Ramsey . d) Per Mertesacker . Why are Arsenal the best team to ever grace English football? Questions put to her in the test included: . 'What was the scoreline for the 2014 FA Cup Final vs Hull City?', . 'What player scored the winning goal in the 2014 FA Cup Final?' 'Name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions.' She struggled to come up with the 11th player of the starting  squad (Koscielny, defence, apparently) and thought Ozil was defence and Wellbeck a midfielder, when in fact they are midfield and striker respectively. Tut tut. She scored some decent points for her more creative answers. Asked to explain why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard in her own words, she wrote, 'Sanchez is buff, scores lots of goals, Hazard is a p***k, Sanchez is Chilean'. She got double marks for the Hazard comment, but only got half a point for the last one. Saskia clearly knows how to keep her boyfriend happy, as she humoured his question of 'Why are Arsenal the best team to ever grace English football?' with the answer of 'They've won many FA Cups' and 'Thierry Henry is a legend'. However, when she got an answer wrong, her examiner wrote the correct answer in capitals and drew an angry face. This man clearly means business. Doh! Saskia struggled to name all 11 players of the starting squad and got confused on the player positions . Saskia's boyfriend drew an angry face when she got a question wrong - this man means business . Saskia kept her boyfriend happy with creative answers to his questions, and got double marks for some... He was impressed with the end result, though, grading her an 'A' and rewarding her by not ending their relationship. And they say romance is dead. Comments generally hailed the man as a 'legend' and fellow football fans were impressed with Saskia's knowledge. Some Twitter users hailed the unnamed boyfriend who tested Saskia on her Arsenal knowledge as a legend . Scoring 87%, football fans were impressed with Saskia, claiming her as 'proper GF material' May men felt inspired, with @lewisxweeked warning his girlfriend to 'get revising' Indeed, @gstarrs85 congratulated Saskia and stating that she was 'proper GF material'. Plenty of men felt inspired by the post, with @lewisxweekes telling his girlfriend @LayciJade to 'get revising' and @DigsXIII crying 'WHERE CAN I GET THIS TEST FROM?' Others, though, felt that the boyfriend had taken things a tad too far. @GunSaurEd11 stated 'football fans are nuts', and @DCSLFC commented 'Imagine actually broadcasting that your boyfriend is the biggest biff-head ever to the world.' We reckon it was  a bit of fun and he wouldn't really have dumped her if she'd failed... at least we like to think that's the case. Trimothy wants to put his girlfriend to the test, although apparently can't be bothered to create his own exam . Eduardo claims 'football fans are nuts' despite appearing to be one as he holds what looks suspiciously like the FA Cup in his hands... Some thought Saskia's boyfriend took things too far with @DCSLFC creatively naming him a 'biff-head'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland (CNN)Protesters angry over the death of Freddie Gray got into physical altercations with police Saturday night in downtown Baltimore near the city's famed baseball stadium. Some of the hundreds who confronted lines of  police officers got into shoving matches with helmeted cops while other demonstrators threw objects. At least five police cars were damaged by people who smashed windows and jumped on them. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was profoundly disappointed by the violence, adding that 95% of the protesters were respectful but a \"small group of agitators intervened.\" Twelve people were arrested, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. \"We continue to have a few isolated pockets of individuals causing disturbances. We are deploying resources to keep everyone safe,\" the Baltimore Police Department tweeted. Fredericka Gray, the twin sister of Freddie Gray, made a statement: \"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence? Freddie Gray would not want this.' Freddie's father and mother do not want any violence. Violence does not get justice.\" Vandals broke and damaged storefront windows and trashed one 7-Eleven, police said. CNN crews observed a window damaged at a Michael Kors store and holes in one at a Subway restaurant. The skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on April 12. He died a week later. The numbers of protesters dissipated substantially just before sunset, though some people were still walking in the streets near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, causing some traffic problems. Earlier, demonstrators had marched through the streets until they arrived at City Hall. Along the way, whenever it appeared the protest might get out of control, organizers reined the marchers back in. The event ended after speeches at Baltimore City Hall on Saturday evening, but many protesters continued to vent their anger by marching down to Inner Harbor. When demonstrators got to the stadium, tensions escalated and some people threw what appeared to be water bottles and other objects at the cops, who wore helmets and stood behind metal barricades. Fans who were arriving to watch the hometown Orioles play the Boston Red Sox were having trouble finding ways to the entrance gates. The Orioles won the game 5-4 in extra innings. For a time it appeared that fans would be held inside the ballpark until the demonstration quieted, but the gates were opened before the contest was over. Throughout the day, protesters yelled, \"No justice, no peace\" and \"All night, all day; we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray.\" The police department used Twitter to update the public on the progress of the march. At City Hall, speakers demanded justice for the Gray family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects. At least one protest organizer had promised in advance that the event would be big enough to shut down the city, but while many people turned out and walked, the major disruption was only to traffic on a few streets. Gray died last Sunday. Protesters have marched since, outraged by the arrest, which was recorded on a bystander's cell phone and the nature of Gray's death. The witness said Gray was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. At some point after he was detained, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. On Friday, police officials said that Gray should have received medical care at the site of his arrest and at other times as he was transported to a police station. The van carrying him stopped three times on its way to the station where he was to be booked, but when it arrived at the Western District officers called for an ambulance, which took him to a hospital. The questions investigators are looking into are: How and where did Gray suffer a severe spinal injury? And are police liable for his death? The preliminary work on his autopsy has been done, but the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and may invite spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report may take 30 to 45 days. Batts told reporters on Friday there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care \"multiple times.\" Those comments upset members of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police. \"We are disappointed in the comments made yesterday by Commissioner Anthony Batts, and various members of his command staff, relative to the actions of the officers directly involved in the Gray investigation,\" Gene Ryan, president of the organization said in a written statement. \"These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete.\" Police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. A wake for Gray will be held Sunday, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday.

Dave Doggett, the boss of League Two outfit Cambridge United, believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals prior to games. He said violence at matches has increased recently as the older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs'. Scroll down for video . Dave Doggett, the chairman of Cambridge United, has warned of a new breed of hooliganism and believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals . Mr Doggett\u00a0said violence at matches has increased recently as older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs' Writing in his club's latest programme, Mr Doggett said: 'Unfortunately football clubs still attract an undesirable element of society that appear determined to ruin the enjoyment of real supporters of football clubs. 'Our promotion to the Football League appears to have encouraged our \"risk\" from the 1980s to come out of retirement. 'Many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their \"gangs\". 'It sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality. We are working closely with police. 'Hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables. 'Our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport.' Peter Woor, a Cambridge United fan, said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as Southend United and Luton Town. He said: 'There's a tension and you feel threatened so I don't go to those places anymore. It's not worth it. 'Most places are fine though, but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden. 'I remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it's nothing like that but it's still a problem. 'These people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this. It's very sad.' Cambridge supporter Simon Dobbin, 42 (pictured with wife Nicole), remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after an away game to Southend on March 21. Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' Mr Doggett said older men were those causing violence. Pictured: Police with fans following reports of disorder outside Southend's Spread Eagle pub prior to the recent match between the Essex side and Cambridge . One Cambridge season ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said a group of about 30 fans regularly turn up to games looking for trouble afterwards. He said: 'They arrive after the game starts and then leave before it finishes to find a fight.' Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after their game away to Southend on March 21. Essex Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' and believe he was set upon by a group of thugs intent on attacking the visiting Cambridge fans. Cambridgeshire Police said the force has also seen an increase in the 'severity and volume' of football-related disorder this season. Inspector Steve Kerridge said: 'We have seen an increase in football-related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people, both in Cambridge and other locations when the club has travelled. 'The tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in Southend have been reported widely and sicken us all. Mr Doggett said Cambridge United had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to League Two last year. Pictured:\u00a0Southend United's Barry Corr beats Richard Tait to the ball in last month's match . 'The club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with Cambridge United.' He said police are using football banning orders, which impose 'stringent court-backed' restrictions on individuals. He added: 'The increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary.' The warning comes as football chiefs across the country continue to promote the Kick It Out Season of Action campaign to promote respect within football.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nI conducted a poll on my radio show recently, and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe Manchester United will win the title next season. Is it heart ruling the head among the United faithful? Or is there a genuine belief that serial winner Louis van Gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again? Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Van Gaal poses for pictures with United fans at the training ground during a day for the club's foundation . Van Gaal (pictured talking to fans) is starting to assert himself at the United after a stuttering start . If he is to take United back to the very top, he\u2019ll need more than Memphis Depay. I\u2019ve already established in this column recently that Van Gaal is a great, and he is a winner. I love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career. The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time \u2013 just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department \u2013 his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don\u2019t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it\u2019s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He\u2019s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he\u2019s dealt with Van Gaal\u2019s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I\u2019ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019s a winner and a leader \u2013 perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view \u2013 Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can\u2019t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney\u2019s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate \u2013 for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season \u2013 he\u2019s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble \u2013 European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that\u2019s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV\u2019s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It\u2019s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?",

A 21-year-old man has been arrested after a man died following a late-night brawl in Clacton last night. The suspect from Clacton was arrested on suspicion of murder at 11.40am. He is being questioned in connection with the death of the man, who was named locally as James Gregoire. The 54-year-old victim, known as 'Pongo' was killed in what Essex Police are describing as 'an altercation' in the town. Officers have closed off a large area of Clacton town centre as forensic specialists conduct a finger-tipped search of the crime scene. A second man was seriously injured in the brawl although his injures are not described as life threatening. A third man suffered minor injuries. It is understood that the brawl continued across the town until one man collapsed and died. All of those involved in the incident are believed to be known to each other and are from the area. A large area of Clacton's town centre was cordoned off this morning as forensic officers conducted a full search of the scene looking for evidence. The incident started at a property on High Street before the brawl spread across the town. Mr Gregorie's body was found in an alleyway between Beach Road and the town's Covered Market. Two of the major shopping roads in the town, Station Road and Pier Avenue have been closed as well as the alleyway where the body was found. Businesses in the area have been warned that large sections of the town will be closed for much of the day as the forensic investigation continues. Mr Gregorie's son Nathan posted a tribute on Facebook: 'r.i.p daddy I cnt believe ur gone I dnt know wat to say I ain't seen u in awhile ima miss u so f****** much love you forever and always.' Mr Gregoire, was jailed for two years in February 2012 after he was caught trying to sell crack cocaine following an undercover police sting. Police believe Mr Gregoire was killed as a result of a brawl that carried on across Clacton's town centre . Essex Police have closed off a large area of Clacton's shopping district while forensic searches continue . Forensic officers gathered evidence across a large area of Clacton due to the size of the crime scene . Superintendent Steve Ditchburn, who is leading the murder investigation said: 'Unfortunately due to the large number of scenes and the extensive cordon day-to-day business in Clacton town centre has been severely disrupted. 'This is necessary to ensure as much early evidence is gathered as possible but we are working as quickly as we can to keep disruption to a minimum. 'I would like to appeal to anyone who has information about the incident, saw any men in and around the Rosemary Road and Station Road areas of the town at around 11.30pm last night, or who has any information which may assist detectives, to contact us as soon as possible.' An Essex police spokesman added: 'Any witnesses or anyone who has information should contact detectives in Clacton on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.' Mr Gregoire's son Nathan led tributes to his late father on his Facebook page earlier this morning . Police confirmed they arrested a 21-year-old man earlier today on suspicion of Mr Gregoire's murder . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, was arrested Wednesday night at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after returning on a flight from Turkey. He has now been charged in a criminal complaint with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, Wisconsin (pictured left in his mugshot on Wednesday and right in 2010 when he\u00a0registed on the sex offender's list) has been accused of flying to ISIS in a failed attempt to join ISIS . The criminal complaint, which had been under seal since Oct. 28, alleges that Van Haften talked to people about his plan before leaving the United States in August for Istanbul. The complaint cites Facebook posts from Van Haften that said he was unable to cross the border from Turkey into Syria. In one post, Van Haften complained that the people who were supposed to help him just wanted his money, that he had almost no cash left and that he was dropped off on a road in the country and never picked up. Wisconsin court records showed several previous convictions for Van Haften, including felony battery in 1998, second degree felony sexual assault in 1999 and disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in 2007, online court records show. He was apprehended at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday after getting off a return flight from Syria (file picture) All of the offenses occurred in Rock County. Van Haften was sentenced to three years' probation on the battery conviction in 1998, but his probation was revoked in 1999 and he was sentenced to a year in jail. He was sentenced to eight years' probation on the sexual assault charge in 1999, but that was revoked in 2000. He was then sentenced to seven years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Carlin from the Department of Justice said stopping people from traveling to the region to join the Islamic State is a 'top priority'. She said in a statement: 'Stemming the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and holding accountable those who attempt to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations remains a top priority for the National Security Division.

How the Premier League table looks . Kane's heat map vs Burnley. Click for more . Harry Kane had a bad day at the office by his recent high standards: . 0 SHOTS on target by Kane. The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14\u00a0Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino\u2019s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. \u2018He deserved it,\u2019 he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. \u2018He has the quality,\u2019 he said. \u2018So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).\u2019 Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. \u2018It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,\u2019 Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City\u2019s recent defeat here and complained that \u2018long balls into the box\u2019 made Sean Dyche\u2019s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal\u2019s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. \u2018Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??\u2019 tweeted Darren Anderton.

Kyle Walker receives treatment on the pitch before he was forced off through injury and replaced by Ben Davies for Tottenham . Walker was forced off through injury in the second half as Tottenham chased the win against Burnley at Turf Moor . Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game \u2014 they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England\u2019s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham\u2019s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson\u2019s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team\u2019s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

Burnley striker Danny Ings stands with hands on hips as he failed to score during the Premier League stalemate at Turf Moor . It was Boyd\u2019s industry that created the first decent chance of the game, the pressure he applied on Ryan Mason forcing the newly capped England player into directing a back-pass into the path of Ings. The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. \u2018I think we edged the game,\u2019 said Dyche afterwards. \u2018Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he\u2019s probably just hit too cleanly. But I\u2019m pleased by the fact that we\u2019ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.\u2019 Not that there was much evidence of that here.

The Spain striker aggravated a hamstring problem in last weekend's win over Stoke. Costa was already certain to miss the games against Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United but had hoped to return in time for the clash against Arsenal on April 26. Diego Costa (centre) has been ruled out for up to the next four weeks after injuring his hamstring vs Stoke . Costa limped off just 11 minutes into his return from injury in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Stoke City on Saturday . The 26-year-old (right) lays on the Stamford Bridge turf in a heap after damaging his hamstring again . But Mourinho says Costa will be fit enough to face the final four games of the season, starting with the clash against Crystal Palace on May 3. 'Only Diego is injured, everybody else is fine and ready,' Mourinho said during the club's pre-match press conference on Friday. '[John Obi] Mikel is ready. [Cesc] Fabregas with a mask, but ready too. No problems. 'We have eight matches to play, if he [Costa] plays four it's normal,' Mourinho said. 'If he plays three it's a little bit below what I'm expecting. If he plays five it's more than I'm expecting.' Costa has a history of hamstring problems but Mourinho is refusing to let his focus shift from Sunday's game at Loftus Road. Asked whether he was concerned about the former Atletico Madrid forward's latest injury, the Chelsea boss said: 'Not concerned. I'm concerned about the match on Sunday. 'At this moment I don't want to think of him (Costa) for two, three weeks.' Blues boss Jose Mourinho (left) hopes to have Costa back for their final four games of the season .",

The Gold model (pictured) is available to pre-order online from O2 and any customers making orders before 10pm BST on 20 April will receive the watch the next day. It will then go on general sale online and exclusively from O2 stores on 23 April . The original Moto 360 has a 22mm black leather strap and costs \u00a3199. Motorola's Gold version has an 18mm stainless steel band and costs \u00a350 more, at \u00a3249.99 - which is \u00a350 cheaper than Apple's cheapest Sport model. The Moto 360 watch launched last year and won praise for its circular design that was seen as a move away from the bulky and computerised-looking Pebble Steel, Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch. It features a 1.5-inch LCD touchscreen with a thin metal band and is powered by Google's Android Wear operating system. The Moto 360 smartwatch runs on Android Wear (pictured).

It was one of the first smartwatches to use a rounded display and rumours suggest Motorola is working on a second-generation model. Apple's Watch is currently available for pre-order in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia, Hong Kong, China and Japan but some models, particularly the Edition range, have sold out in many regions. Apple said shipping would start on 24 April but many buyers are seeing delivery dates of June once the order has been completed. Alternatively, people can book an appointment to try on the Apple Watch in stores, but they won't be able to buy it from the high-street until next Friday.

In a case that was condemned around the world, Luo Kun Kun was expelled from his village when locals - including his own grandfather - signed a petition to banish him to 'protect villagers' health'. Following that cold-hearted decision, the mournful child explained how, 'nobody plays with me, I play alone'. But now a specialist school in Linfen, a city in southern Shanxi Province, has stepped in to help. The Red Ribbon School is the only school in China equipped to look after and educate HIV-positive children. Kun Kun was refused admission to\u00a0schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone . The five-year-old has now been admitted a place at the Red Ribbon School in Linfen, China, . After being banished from his village, Kun Kun finally has a home where he is cared for and looked after . Kun Kun contracted the virus from his mother when she was pregnant with him, but was only diagnosed when he was five years old. His mother and stepfather worked in other provinces, so he was raised near the town of Xichong with his non-blood-related grandparents, who had adopted his stepfather as a child. The boy was refused admission to local schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. When he was diagnosed, his grandparents found themselves isolated in their village of Shufangya in south-eastern China's Sichuan province\u00a0and so sided with the locals. At a special meeting on December 7 last year, 203 village residents signed a petition asking the authorities to 'carry out preventative isolation measures by taking Kun Kun away from the village, and protect the health of the villagers and children'. It went on to say that Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community'. He was also referred to as a 'ticking time bomb'. Wang Yishu, party chief of Shufangya village, said: 'The villagers sympathise with him, he is innocent, and only a small child. But his AIDS is too scary for us'. Kun Kun was forced to play alone in his home village, but has now been admitted to a specialist school . The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's plight made worldwide headlines . However the future is now looking up for Kun Kun, after he was given a place at the boarding school last week. The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's desperate plight made worldwide headlines. Headteacher Guo Xiaoping said: 'A good social and educational environment is important for Kun Kun and with the help of teachers, he is more open and polite than before'. He added: 'Kun Kun's physical strength is notably below that of the other students. Fortunately, he has been sent here in time, and started taking medication last November. At Kunkun's age, it's crucial that he undergoes proper treatment.' Kun Kun did not say a word when he arrived at the school, according to the headteacher, but can study and talk like a normal student now. The devastating case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China . The child was forced out of his village when villagers signed a petition asking the authorities to remove him . The petition signed by villagers said Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community' and referred to him as a 'ticking time bomb' Knowledge of HIV/AIDS in China is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from . Kun Kun was banished from the village of Shufangya, near\u00a0the town of Xichong (shown on this map) The case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China, where many sufferers face widespread discrimination. The problem is so great, even medical workers sometimes refuse to touch those diagnosed with the disease. The latest figures released by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission showed a total of 497,000 people in China have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS since the country's first case in 1985. China has a population of 1.36billion. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from, experts have said. Officials are reportedly planning to educate the villagers who banished Kun Kun through a campaign. The Nanjing-based anti-discrimination NGO Justice for All wrote a letter to party chiefs in Sichuan calling on them to punish school chiefs and local officials for their 'Cultural Revolution style', a reference to the Mao Zedong-inspired public denunciations of 'foes'. 'We cannot imagine how Kun Kun will grow up and look back on the experience of childhood,' said a draft of the letter.",

The Southwest Airlines flight which was scheduled to leave  Midway International Airport at 1.15pm was delayed for almost two hours due to the 'disturbance'. The Chicago Fire Department was called to evaluate Mr Modarkski after he was stabbed in the arm. Mr Mordarski said he would not be pressing charges following the incident. His best friend, photographer Michael Sutton, said the pen stabbing began after Lenny's arm brushed up against the woman while he slept.

'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment.

Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight.

His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday\u2019s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs \u2013 a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of \u2018We\u2019re rich but our team is s***\u2019 and \u2018Where\u2019s the money gone?\u2019 in protest at Ashley\u2019s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of \u00a318.7million and later revealed they have \u00a334m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. \u2018I can understand why fans are frustrated,\u2019 said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. \u2018It\u2019s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there\u2019s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they\u2019ve been. They think \u201cWhere else can I make money? Oh a football club\u201d. \u2018I\u2019ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it\u2019s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . \u2018People will say as supporters you\u2019ve got to come back, you\u2019ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? \u2018Since Mike Ashley\u2019s been here they\u2019ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. \u2018So he\u2019s balanced the books - he\u2019s made money because he\u2019s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be excited yourself?\u201d. \u2018I\u2019m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. \u2018Now it\u2019s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there\u2019s nothing happening? There\u2019s no cup run, I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why he wants to own a football club.\u2019 Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club\u2019s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . \u2018I think you\u2019ve got to get the balance right. It\u2019s not just about making money,\u2019 he said. \u2018Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn\u2019t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn\u2019t work. \u2018Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. \u2018To reconnect has to be the best way forward.\u2019 Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game .",

David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.' Armstrong said there's been no attempt to meet with Howman since 2013.",

Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Scannell, Gobern, Coady (Hogg 81), Butterfield, James, Wells (Bunn 88), Miller . Subs not used: Edgar, Murphy, Wallace, Lolley, Billing .

Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.",

Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents, and according to the publication at least 300 police accessed the files. Acting Commissioner of West Australian Police, Stephen Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states\u00a0police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8 when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued. The next day the Perth-based former AFL star surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station.",

The Californian is bidding for his fourth consecutive victory since losing to Vitor Belfort two years ago and has a title shot in his sights. And he knows exactly what it will take to beat Machida. Lyoto Machida (left) and Luke Rockhold face off ahead of their middleweight clash this weekend . 'A big set of balls. I've just got to come forward and go out there and dominate him,' he said. 'Machida likes to run around and dance and do his thing. I've just got to cut him off, slowly progress and be the bull. He tries to be the matador \u2013 sometimes you've got to play one role or the other and this is the time to be the bull and slowly progress, put him in a bad spot and make him fight my fight. 'I've seen little things that he doesn't like \u2013 there's plenty of other fights too that I've seen that show a lot of holes and areas where I can take advantage of. 'You see fights where guys stand in the middle ground too long \u2013 I've just got to make him think about everything. I'm a true mixed martial artist; I have everything to my game. He's got to think about me taking him down, and then my kicks and my punches and everything that I bring to the table. 'Machida has got a very small avenue to win this fight on the feet. Other than that, my avenue is quite big comparably to his.. He doesn't really have much of a chance on the ground. Rockhold performs during an open workout as he bids to extend his winning streak to five . Machida lands a side kick as he works out in front of fans and media . 'I'll be operating at a different frequency than him \u2013 he doesn't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me.' And while Rockhold afforded Machida his respect, he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory. 'I think there is a mutual respect between Machida and me \u2013 I respect what he does,' he said. 'He's one of the best in the game and has been for a long, long time. 'He's right here at the top, where he's been for the whole of his career. He's a martial artist \u2013 he lives by the code. A lot of people love his fighting style, a lot of people hate his fighting style, but you have to respect his fighting style . 'I respect what he does and I like a lot of the things he does. But at the same time, I'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate. 'I've been running marathons every day so I'm ready to go in there and chase him down.' Rockhold's last victory came against Michael Bisping last November in Australia . Machida is also coming off the back of a victory, against CB Dollaway in Brazil . Machida, meanwhile, is confident he can upset Rockhold and earn himself a title shot. 'I think if I apply my style, my technique, I can stop Luke, you know,' he said. 'If I can do my strategy, I can win the fight. 'I know there was another fight in line for the title shot - Jacare vs Yoel Romero \u2013 but now, whoever wins out of me and Luke \u2013 deserves a title shot I think. 'I can see a couple of weaknesses in Luke but it's hard to say before the fight, it's hard to foresee the fight. I have to be there to feel the fight- to see any mistakes he makes. 'I am very well prepared for this fight. I had eight weeks of camp and I had great training. Glover [Teixeira] was there and many, many other fighters.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)This weekend, millions of people are expected to tune in to watch two men beat each other up. Why is this? We'll explore, but first let's get something out of the way: The big fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather won't \"save\" boxing, a sport that has fallen precipitously since its 20th century heyday. If anything, the so-called \"Fight of the Century\" just reinforces the sport's problems, as two aging heroes collide in what might be the last nationally relevant fight for a very long time. There's so much wrong with boxing's business model, but all you really need to understand is this: Most sports fans probably can't name a single active boxer after Mayweather and Pacquiao. Some might know that the long-reigning heavyweight champ is a towering Ukrainian with a boring jab-happy style, but most wouldn't come up with his name (Wladimir Klitschko). Boxing isn't fading away because we've finally awoken to its brutality but from a combination of catastrophic mismanagement and competition from Mixed Martial Arts -- a younger, more dynamic and better-managed competitor. The rocket rise of MMA's premier organization, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, has matched boxing's equally dramatic decline. In the course of just two decades, the UFC has grown from a freaky-violent carny sideshow into a mainstream sport. In fact, the fan base of the UFC now rivals that of the world's most popular fighting sport: ice hockey. Some aficionados spin elaborate defenses of the hundreds of fist fights that break out every year in NHL games, claiming they make the game safer by punishing dirty play.  But that's so weak. Everyone knows why the NHL hasn't cracked down on fighting hard enough to end it: fans love it way too much. As the hockey announcer Don Cherry once said, \"When [legendary tough guy] Bob Probert was fighting, did you ever see anyone get out of their seat and go get coffee.\" But why do we like to watch fights in the first place? Over the past 20 years, I've watched boxing and MMA in a spirit of nervous fascination. Watching fighters kick, punch and strangle each other, I'd be thinking, I'm a civilized person. I appear not to be a sociopath. So why am I watching? What's wrong with me? And what's wrong with all of us? Who among us hasn't felt the giddy, guilty thrill of a fistfight breaking out -- whether in a schoolyard, a hockey rink or a prize ring? We all claim to hate violence, but I think we protest too much. Inside us all, there's a creature that adores it. How else are we to explain our yen for carnage in rough sports, films, gory video games and literature? So is that it? Are we drawn to a big fight like Mayweather-Pacquiao simply by bloodlust and barbarism? Actually, I think that's only part of the story, and not the biggest part. If we just wanted blood and pain, we wouldn't bother with the tame violence of pay-per-view fisticuffs. Instead, we'd fire up a web browser and watch ISIS snuff videos for free.  But many people who feel no temptation to watch Internet snuff feel sorely tempted to watch a big fight. What's going on? There's a great literature on boxing, with contributions from writers such as Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer and Joyce Carol Oates. For them, boxing isn't really a sport. You can't play boxing like you can play tennis. They compared boxing to a rite, or a religion, or above all to theater, complete with spotlit performers improvising on an elevated stage. A fight was drama sweated down to the bones -- a metaphor for the whole human condition, with everything noble and ugly on display. While it may seem like a stretch, I think we are drawn to prizefights less to revel in what's dark and nasty in human nature than to honor what's good and noble. Prizefights set up conditions of dramatic adversity that evoke what we admire most in human beings: extremes of courage, grace, fortitude and even heroism. So should we feel virtuous as we watch Mayweather and Pacquiao's epic brain damage contest? I wouldn't go that far. Perhaps such spectacles really should, as most of the world's medical societies insist, be abolished. Most of us feel ambivalent toward prizefighting because we should.  A fight puts the darkest stuff in human nature on display: the bared fangs, the blood, the frenetic drive to do harm. But all that dark stuff draws out the best stuff, and turns a great fight into a showcase for the indomitability of human will. When Mayweather and Pacquiao clash at center ring on Saturday night, the good angels of human nature will yearn to turn away -- and to lean in.",

The 47-year-old was first arrested in 2003 during a dawn raid on his house. 1,675 images and videos depicting child pornography were discovered by officers. He went on the run for eight years - during which time his mother and father both died - and was reportedly living in Hungary. At the time he left a note for his parents, which read: \u2018Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my computer. I was arrested. \u2018I must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents. Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away.

The whereabouts of the part-time actor, who appeared in Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, remained a mystery until he handed himself in to a police station in west London. He was jailed at lsleworth Crown Court in October 2012 for 12 months after admitting 20 counts of making indecent images of children, 17 of which were of pre-teen boys. Judge Rosa Dean, sentencing at the time, told him: \u2018Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.\u2019 But he served only 12 weeks because he had already spent three months on remand.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nSergio Ramos was the first man Carlo Ancelotti embraced at the final whistle of Real Madrid\u2019s dramatic Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Asked after the game when it was that he had decided to move the defender forward into midfield to cover the absence of Luka Modric, he replied: \u2018The minute after I found out Modric was injured\u2019. The two kept it between themselves and it worked on the night. Ramos is one of those players for whom the old Liverpool song about Jamie Carragher \u2018We all dream of a team of Carraghers\u2019 would be appropriate. He could play in every single position on the pitch. Sergio Ramos (left) celebrates with Javier Hernandez (centre) and Pepe after Real's winning goal . Ramos gees up the crowd during another all-action display at the Santiago Bernabeu for Real Madrid . It was a fiery Madrid derby on Wednesday night, but Ramos (left) once again proved his worth to Real . He often fools around in goal at Spain training. He started his Real Madrid career as a right back and won the European Championship there for his country. He has filled in at left-back, can play across the midfield and actually started his youth football career as striker. Had he been born British he would probably have grown up as a box-to-box midfielder. In Spain midfielders who have pace and can head and tackle often end up at centre-back and that is where he has settled. On Wednesday when his team needed him he was pitched into midfield and he let no-one down. And that\u2019s the thing about Ramos. He very rarely lets anyone down. He is Real Madrid\u2019s Carles Puyol \u2013 the all-action hero who rises above everyone else in in the penalty area in the Champions League final and heads in a corner that equalises Atletico Madrid\u2019s 1-0 lead in injury time, allowing Real to play out extra-time and score three more to lift the trophy. Ramos heads away from his own penalty area, but spent most of the game marshalling the midfield . The makeshift midfielder holds off Atletico Madrid's Koke during a superb display in the middle of the park . And when does fall short as he did from the penalty spot against Bayern Munich in 2010 in the Champions League semi-final when he sent his kick \u2013 at least as far as Twitter was concerned \u2013 into outer space, he has the guts to take another one in the European Championship final a couple of months later, and not only score but dink it Panenka style over the keeper\u2019s dive. He has been mocked in the past for his Colemanballs comments that usually amount to declaring himself \u2018happy with the three points\u2019 after a cup game or \u2018looking forward to the second leg\u2019 after a league game, but even those who have in the past mocked him have come to admire him. It always seemed that even Jose Mourinho during his fall-out with Iker Casillas could never really properly fall out with Casillas' ally Ramos because there was too much about him that he admired. Ramos too, while ultimately siding with Spain team-mate Casillas, always saw the worth of a bold and proactive manager. The Spanish centre-back celebrates his crucial, last-minute goal in last year's Champions League final . Ramos has shown character to bounce back from his errors, as his penalty for Spain in 2012 showed . His supporters believe he stands for a dignity that many feel is disappearing from the game. \u2018I like managers to be nice guys but I also like them to have balls\u2019 he said of Ancelotti\u2019s decision to play him out of his usual position against Atletico. \u2018We would both have never heard the end of it had we been knocked out\u2019 he said after that 1-0 win with him deployed to win aerial duels with Mario Mandzukic who Ancelotti had noted dropped back into midfield to get on the end of Atletico keeper Jan Oblak\u2019s drop kicks. Real now have nine games left if they reach the Champions League final. Ramos will play in all of them no doubt. He may even cover for Modric again with the midfielder not back for another five weeks; he will play as an auxiliary striker if Real Madrid need a late goal, and he\u2019ll go in goal if the emergency presents itself. Someone really should teach Real Madrid supporters that song: \u2018We all dream of a team of Sergios\u2019",

Thames Valley Police called an Army bomb disposal team after a startled passer-by reported the 4ft long guided missile in a rocket launcher on top of the barge in Reading. Perched next to the fake warhead were the head and shoulders of a convincing-looking man, his eyes staring grimly from holes cut in a balaclava shrouding his face. Panic: A terror alert was sparked on the Thames this week after someone reported seeing a missile on top of a barge in Reading . A spokesman said 'Thames Valley Police received a report from a member of the public about a suspected weapon on a canal boat in Caversham last night. 'Officers attended and conducted a search of the area, and the boat was located. The reported weapon was found to be purely ornamental. 'Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) were also informed and are satisfied it was not a live device.' The canal boat was moored near a children's play area in Christchurch Meadows, where the River Thames flows through Reading. After approaching the boat, police and the bomb disposal unit inspected the missile and confirmed the deadly-looking weapon was a dummy. Menacing: Alongside the 4ft missile were the head and shoulders of a dummy wearing a balaclava . Bizarre sight:\u00a0A local resident, who asked not to be named, condemned the prank, saying: 'What a stupid thing to put on top of a boat in a town centre' A local resident, who asked not to be named, said 'What a stupid thing to put on top of a boat in a town centre. 'Goodness knows what possessed the boat owner - didn't they realise the panic it would spread? 'We're hoping the police take the time to have a word with them and ask them to remove it. 'It's not funny at all in this day and age, with all the horrible things involving terrorists.' Reading is just a few miles from Windsor where the Queen was in residence in the Castle this week - presenting the VC to Afghan war hero Joshua Leakey. Prank: Police and an Army bomb disposal team responded to the call and later said the missile 'was found to be purely ornamental' Realistic fake: The 4ft-long model weapon was mounted on the roof on the barge as it sailed down the Thames in Berkshire .",

The 69-year-old collaborated with NBC's\u00a0Today show to launch a contest for one Elvis-obsessed couple to win the 'ultimate wedding'. The winning duo - announced next Monday - will tie the knot at Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel inside the Westgate Hotel on Thursday, April 23. Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas . Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home. Couples wanting to be the first  to  wed at the Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel must submit a video or photos along with an explanation detailing why they deserve the prize.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nAlmost a third of teachers have suffered online bullying at the hands of parents in the last year, a survey suggests. Families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers. Around 30 per cent of teachers said they had been the subject of parents\u2019 abusive internet posts. A study of 1,500 teachers found 30 per cent have suffered online abuse by parents - and that this type of bullying is on the rise accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year . And the poll found that bullying by parents is on the rise, accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year compared to just 27 per cent last year. The survey, by teachers\u2019 union NASUWT, reveals a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. One teacher said they had been sworn at by a parent online over a PE lesson, while a female dance teacher said she had been called a \u2018paedophile\u2019 for wanting to film a performance. Others said they had received insults from parents about their appearance and weight, with one told she was ugly and her \u2018husband could do better than her\u2019. Of those harassed online by parents, 15 per cent had threats made against them, compared to seven per cent in 2014. The poll  also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year . Around eight per cent saw allegations of inappropriate behaviour with students, six per cent saw videos or photos taken without consent and three per cent were told they had behaved inappropriately towards parents. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year \u2013 increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: \u2018It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.\u2019 He added: \u2018The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers\u2019 health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.\u2019 The survey found that many teachers had received racist, sexist and homophobic remarks online \u2013 with one teacher called a \u2018wog\u2019 by a pupil and others called \u2018lesbian\u2019 and \u2018slut\u2019. And teachers said that 60 per cent of the abusive comments online had been written by pupils. Over half of the pupils responsible for abuse were aged between 14 and 16, while 38 per cent were aged between 11 and 14, the teachers\u2019 poll found. One teacher received the comment \u2018I hope she gets cancer\u2019, while a heavily pregnant worker was sworn at, called \u2018fat whore\u2019 and \u2018ugly\u2019. Another said they had been harassed for seven months by pupils who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in their name. A number of teachers reported pupils had used their identity to set up bogus Facebook profiles and post sexually inappropriate messages. One man only found out months afterwards and feared it could be used to \u2018smear him\u2019 and destroy his career. Just under a third of bullied teachers did not report the incidents to their school or to police. Mrs Keates went on to say: \u2018While there has been some improvement in action taken on reported abuse, there are still too many cases where no appropriate action is taken and teachers are being left devastated, humiliated and traumatised.\u2019 The union called for the next government to require schools to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to online abuse and use all sanctions available to address any bullying of staff. Some of the most disturbing examples of online abuse from parents include: . A female attacked by parents for her appearance and the size of her nose. She was told she was \u2018ugly\u2019 and \u2018her husband could do better\u2019. Another was called \u2018rubbish\u2019, with a mother incorrectly claiming that she had \u2018tried to kill her daughter\u2019 by making her do PE without an inhaler. A parent posted comments saying that a female dance teacher was \u2018a paedophile\u2019 for videoing performances. A teacher was sworn at and told he was \u2018pathetic\u2019 for asking a pupil to replace equipment he had broken. Family members falsely accused a teacher of having sex with pupils \u2013 making him fear for his career.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nAn upcoming documentary describes Yelp as the internet's equivalent to the mafia, and the publicly-traded company is doing everything in its power to discredit the film before it is released. Yelp, founded in 2004 by two former PayPal employees, is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor's offices. However, like many web businesses, Yelp's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site. Kaylie Milliken is the filmmaker behind Billion Dollar Bully, an ongoing documentary focused on Yelp's impact on small businesses. While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied. Scroll down for video . A racket? A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014 . Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise . 'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says. Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp. 'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he\u2019s complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn\u2019t figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company . Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production.\u00a0The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the\u00a0trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page. 'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on\u00a0CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive. 'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website . Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall . Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page. While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken. 'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads. Prost Production's Kickstarter campaign reached its $60,000 funding goal, and Milliken says she will resume filming in May with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the Sundance Film Festival.",

She walked through the city centre to Dorset Street where she waited for a bus before attending the addiction studies course.

Catherine Nevin leaving the Central Criminal Court in Dublin during her trial in 2000 . Dressed in jeans, a blue fleece top and a pair of black Ugg boots, Nevin took in sights she hasn't seen since being jailed 15 years ago. She laughed and joked with a pal for more than an hour at the nearby Applegreen Garage before her course started. She failed last July to have her conviction overturned, though this outing will fuel speculation a full release from jail is imminent. Her temporary release is understood to have been approved by the parole board and sanctioned by the Justice Minister. The course is part of her pre-release plan to help her integrate back into society once freed. Nevin's current study leave is her latest educational placement after she studied the same topic at the Mounttown Community Facility in Dun Laoghaire last October. While attending that course, run by the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Drugs Task Force, she was always accompanied by prison warders. Completion of the course gives participants a FETAC Level 5 Addiction Studies Certificate. It's believed that as well as attending the course in Inchicore, Nevin has also been using facilities at Maynooth University in Co Kildare and Trinity College over the past few weeks. While in prison Nevin has been keeping herself busy. She has a job in the jail library and likes to do makeovers on other inmates. It was revealed in July 2013 how Scissor Sister Charlotte Mulhall, who is serving life for murder, regarded her as a close friend in jail. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Tom Nevin was shot dead in the couple's pub, Jack White's Inn, in Brittas Bay, Co Wicklow, in March 1996. His wife was also convicted of soliciting three men \u2013 Gerry Heapes, William McClean and John Jones \u2013 to kill him. Despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of Tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate. Her trial was shrouded in controversy and has gone down in history as the longest ever murder trial in the history of Ireland. The trial and media coverage of the case was dominated by an intense focus on Nevin herself, forcing the judge to order a ban on all reporting of her clothing and appearance. No physical evidence linking her to horrific crime was ever discovered. Her conviction was based largely on the evidence of the three men she is alleged to have solicited. Nevin married Galway-born Tom in 1976. Over the following years they built up a property portfolio, before in 1986 buying the landmark pub where Tom was murdered . His death was initially investigated his death as a pub raid which had gone tragically wrong.

One of the dogs ears had been bitten off.\u00a0All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed . Three\u00a0men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes. All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed. Darren Wheatcroft pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan, and farmer Simon Whitworth pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting. All three were handed suspended prison sentences and ordered to pay a total of \u00a340,000 to the RSPCA at Burnley Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

Stuart McCall  urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure . The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston . \u2018We\u2019ve already spoken about going into the play-offs with good momentum,\u2019 said McCall. \u2018Tonight is a set-back but we\u2019ve got to make sure on Sunday that we don\u2019t have another set-back or then it can become a problem. \u2018We will be fully focused on Sunday and we will be looking for the three points. \u2018There will be no confidence factor come Sunday \u2014 I can assure you of that. Sometimes you get beat and you just have to hold your hands up and give credit to the opposition. \u2018I was pleased with certain things leading up to their first goal. I thought we were doing well. \u2018I said to the lads that we will put a line under it. Yeah, we know we weren\u2019t good tonight but we will be good on Sunday.\u2019 Rangers remain third in the table \u2014 behind Hibernian on goal difference but with a game in hand \u2014 after what was their biggest-ever loss to Queens. \u2018Fair play to them,\u2019 said McCall, who expects Cammy Bell to be fit to face Raith after a minor knee injury. \u2018They were clinical when they had their chances. New manager McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after doubling Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . \u2018We controlled large parts of the first half but they got a lot of good blocks in. It\u2019s about scoring goals and they got the first one. \u2018Then we lost a goal that was really poor defending straight from the kick-off. Then you are chasing the game and that suited them with their pace on the counter attack. \u2018We had some chances in the second half but we never really did enough. We weren\u2019t good enough to win the game but we move on. \u2018I\u2019ve said it before and I will say it again, there will be ups and downs between now and the end of the season. It\u2019s how we react to it, and Sunday can\u2019 t come quickly enough for me.\u2019 Jubilant Queen of the South boss James Fowler was thrilled with a result that saw his team leapfrog Falkirk into that crucial fourth place in the Championship standings. \u2018We were backs to the wall a wee bit in the first half,\u2019 admitted Fowler. \u2018But we managed to cope with that. We got the goal and then getting another one so early in the second half was great. \u2018All the players were great and we are pushing hard.\u2019",

In accordance with federal law the airline gave people the chance to get off the plane after it had been stuck for three hours.

In the mean time, passengers told how the short-haul flight's meager supplies of crackers and water dwindled, while the single bathroom became 'foul' and ran out of necessary supplies. A Republic spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Passengers were offered the opportunity to deplane, despite several erroneous media reports. 'Republic eventually cancelled the flight, and the Company repositioned another aircraft so passengers could continue on to their destination. 'Further, United was reaching out to customers to offer compensation.

The hand railing and pedestal lighting has been damaged while a cover over the satellite system (above) has also been damaged and removed for safety reasons .

Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday and have continued unabated, amid reports that there has been some damage. 'High winds have caused minor damage to some external features such as an equipment cover and some partitioning, while heavy rains have dampened some doorway carpets,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This damage is superficial and has not affected the ship\u2019s operation in any way.\u00a0Guests and crew are safe and the Captain is ensuring guests are as comfortable as possible.'

'The scheduled Sydney arrival of Carnival Cruise Lines\u2019 Carnival Spirit has been delayed due to severe weather which has led to the closure of Sydney port and prevented the Harbour Pilot from boarding the ship,' the statement said. 'The ship is now waiting off the Sydney coast line until the port is re-opened.' And nothing can be done until conditions ease to allow the regulatory process to take place. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port,' Carnival Cruise Lines stated further.

Carnival Cruise Liners in statement said: 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open' In a further statement placed on social media, to those travellers caught out by the drama, they said: 'We are sorry to announce that Carnival Spirit will be unable to sail from Sydney today as the port of Sydney has been closed due to extreme weather and ships are not permitted to enter Sydney Harbour.' 'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.'

'He just looked so fragile. Literally a few hours after I met him for the first time, the doctors said he wasn't going to make it,' his mother Carman Gould, who had an emergency caesarean at just 26 weeks, told Nine News. Scroll down for video . Etienne Gould Nunan was finally allowed to go home after spending almost five months in hospital . He was born premature, after just 26 weeks in the womb, and weighed only 558 grams . She and her partner Jonathan Nunan would spend the next four and a half months practically living at the hospital and watching as their son developed pneumonia, suffered a collapsed lung and endured 58 blood transfusions to fight infections. 'Given the way he started, a lot of times both the family and us were very worried about him, whether he would be able to make it at all,' Monash's associate professor Arvind Sehgal said.

'You've watched this baby through this plastic window for ten days and so to finally hold him skin to skin; it's the moment that you've been waiting for,' Ms Gould said. 'It's the moment you start to think \"yeh, I am a mum\".' The proud parents said they celebrated each day as it came, alongside the little joys it brought, from Etienne's first bath to his first hug with dad and his first feed with mum. 'Etienne came home after 138 days in the NICU needing only vitamins and a little breathing support...and we expect him to grow out of that in the next few months. All his other issues were resolved, some spontaneously,' the couple wrote in a compilation video of their son's five month long hospital battle.

Daily Mail Online spoke to students at Kirkwood Community College's regional center in Jones County, where the former secretary of state will hold her first low-key campaign event. The outlook isn't sunny for the kickoff of her 'listening tour': Of the ten students interviewed in the school's public lounge, only two would speak kindly of Mrs. Clinton. 'She's going to push some emotional thing on us,' predicted student Hallie Corum in between classes. 'What else is she supposed to do?' 'She's going to be, like, talking s**t.' 'TALKING S**T': Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign on Sunday and hit the road in a van, en route to a skeptical bunch of community college students in Monticello, Iowa . Corey Jones said he suspects that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want immigration reform because it would result in a new generation of grateful Democratic voters \u2013 and he plans to ask her about it on Tuesday . Kirkwood Community College's outpost in rural Monticello serves hundreds of students, including some who are still high school juniors and seniors . Corum declined to be photographed, flashing an impish grin. Corey Jones, a graphic design student, is among those chosen to question Mrs. Clinton in a roundtable setting on Tuesday. He said his teachers chose him to join a group of 'from 6 to 8' students whowill participate because 'I pay attention to politics,' something his friends around a table agreed with. 'I didn't know Hillary Clinton was running,' one young woman said. 'Is she running? Go ask Corey. He's up on all that stuff.' Jones said he plans to ask Hillary about illegal immigration. 'It's \u2013 well, Immigration reform,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal.' 'She's part of all that. And some people think \u2013 well, I think maybe \u2013 it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes'\u00a0from millions of grateful new citizens. Jones, like Corum, will vote in his first presidential election next year. He said Clinton is holding her first campaign event at a community college 'because she's trying to appeal to youth, to young voters.' 'She announced it on YouTube. That's targeted at people my age, right?' Clinton set off on a 1,000-mile road trip Sunday in her home town of Chappaqua, New York, and headed to Iowa \u2013 where the nation's first primary caucuses will start the machinery that chooses major parties' presidential candidate. She announced Sunday afternoon that she was officially in the race. A female student who declined to be named speculated about Clinton's motives for taking ground transportation instead of a jet aircraft. 'Can you imagine if she stepped off a private jet in Des Moines or Iowa City and walked down a set of steps in realy expensive shoes and a thousand-dollar outfit?' she asked. 'That would be, um, a really bad idea. I like the van better. Is it a minivan? God, I hope it's not a minivan.' Future chef Ross Vander Peut said gay marriage is a 'deal-breaker' for him but worries that Hillary Clinton 'seems like, kinda like a control freak' Monticello, Iowa is a sleepy farm town whose main street is lined with shops sporting signs that look like relics from the mid-twentieth century . Most students in Monday's random sample chose not to talk about Mrs. Clinton. All of the will be old enough to vote next year for the first time in their lives. Three said they didn't have an opinion about the Democratic front-runner. One looked up, shook her head, and put a pair of earbuds on. Two more said they would rather remain silent. 'You know, it's that \"If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all\" deal,' a young woman offered from behind her tablet computer. Moments later a group of young men walked down a hallway mimicking Bill Clinton's infamous 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' press conference \u2013 and laughing uproariously. One who would talk is Bri Parks, a speech and psychology student who wants to be an FBI profiler because she likes 'trying to figure out how the human brain works.' Clinton can work to earn her vote, Parks said. 'If I heard her opinions and liked her ideas, I would support her.' But 'I hope people don't vote for her just because she's a woman.' Asked for the nicest thing she could say about Mrs. Clinton, Parks said 'she's not going at this saying, \"Look, I'm a woman, so vote for me.\" She's not using her sex to prove a point.' 'She's looking at herself as a politician, not as a woman.' Students like these gathered in a Kirkwood Community College lounge and spoke with Daily Mail Online before and after classes on Monday . Bri Parks, a Kirkwood Community College student, said she hopes Americans don't vote for Hillary Clinton 'just because she's a woman' 'I don't think we should be putting people in extremely high political positions because of race, sex, or whatever,' Parks explained. 'Then you're doing things just because of what people look like.' Kirkwood serves between 22,000 and 26,000 students taking college-credit courses at sites in seven Iowa counties, according to a school official. The Monticello outpost is canceling many classes on Tuesday, making some students scratch their heads since 'this is the smallest part of Kirkwood,' as one pointed out. 'They could have had it somewhere else.' As it is, Kirkwood's students who do have class will have to dodge Secret Service agents and TV news cameras to get through the lobby. Some of them are recent high school graduates while others are finishing their 11th- and 12th-grade years collecting college credits one day per week. Ross Vander Peut, a self-described future chef, is one of the youngest. He's 16, a high-school junior, but will turn 18 just before the election. Vander Peut described himself as a libertarian \u2013 'I like government to leave me alone,' he said \u2013 and gay marriage is 'a deal-breaker.' 'Equal rights, homosexual rights, it's one thing I will not sway on,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'If you are against gay marriage, you've lost my vote. There's nothing you can do to change it.' He hedged on Hillary, saying she 'seems like, kinda like a control freak.' 'But she also seems very strong-willed and determined. When she wants something done she probably does it herself.'",

The monarch, who was resplendent in a fuchsia suit and a matching hat, appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers in the Royal Box. Unfortunately for Her Majesty, her horse  was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner. Oh no! The Queen allows herself a look of horror as Ring of Truth is narrowly pipped to the post . One is not amused: The Queen briefly looks glum before smiling at her second place finish . Better than nothing: The Queen's second place appeared to go down well and she got a third place later on . The Queen, who has long been an avid racing fan, had a second runner later in the afternoon but was once again left to rue missed chances after her horse Capel Path came in third. Newbury Racecourse is currently hosting the Dubai Duty Free Spring Trials, one of the most prestigious dates on the flat racing calendar. The event, which coincides with the racecourse's annual real ale festival, also saw runners owned by fellow royal Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai take to the track. Unfortunately for the Emirati, the horses bred by his Godolphin Stud also failed to triumph with one, Strong Chemistry, taking second place in the Dubai Duty Free Full Of Surprises Handicap. Despite failing to register a win, the 88-year-old monarch was on cheerful form and chatted happily to jockey Richard Hughes in the parade ring ahead of the Maiden Stakes. Top tips: The Queen chatted to Ring of Truth's jockey Richard Hughes ahead of the race . Looking around: The Queen, joined by racing manager John Warren (second right), toured the parade ring . Enjoying the day: Afterwards, she made her way back to the Royal Box in the grandstand . The Queen certainly has plenty to smile about, with her fifth great-grandchild due next weekend and sex claims against her son Prince Andrew struck out by a US judge. She has also been  making the most of the recent spell of hot weather and has been pictured twice in the last seven days enjoying a trot around Windsor Great Park. The Queen, who usually rides wearing a silk scarf rather than a riding hat, first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. Lovely: The Queen was resplendent in a cheerful fuchsia coat and a matching hat . Cheerful: The Queen has multiple reasons to be cheerful at the moment, including the impending royal birth . Great-grandchild: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child will be her fifth great-grandchild . Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral. So close: Ring of Truth (left) tries to make up the gap between her and Harvard Man . Pipped: In the event, Harvard Man galloped ahead to win the Maiden Stakes at Newbury .",

Of course in the next few weeks I will be going around the world to talk about the situation with Kevin but this is just informal information. 'I will talk to everybody but Kevin is very, very happy with Wolfsburg and the way they have treated him since he arrived from Chelsea last year. 'There are still five games to play and hopefully they can make sure of a place in the Champions League next season so it is a little bit too early to be making any decisions. He has a four-year contract at Wolfsburg so we will have to see what they want to do. 'I have met the people from Manchester City and we know each other. I've never spoken to anyone from Manchester United but a lot of other clubs have been in touch to find out some general information.'

Officials ordered 250,000 birds to be slaughtered in Telangana\u00a0after cases of the H5N1 virus were identified, which can be deadly in humans. The virus caused the deaths of nearly 400 people and hundreds of millions of poultry after it spread from Asia into Europe and Africa in 2005-2006. Culled: About 250,000 birds infected with the H5N1 virus are slaughtered in Telangana, India . Since then, India has regularly reported cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild and domestic birds. Veterinary staff from the local government's animal husbandry department carried out the cull - which included destroying hundreds of thousands of infected eggs - at Thorrur village in the Ranga Reddy district. Birds present in poultry farms were slaughtered while the eggs, including those stored in warehouses, were dumped in a pit. Destroyed: Thousands of infected eggs were dumped in a pit and buried following an outbreak of bird flu . Clean up: Authorities ordered the destruction of birds and eggs at farms across\u00a0Telangana in India following the latest bird flu outbreak . Bird feed stock was burned and the sites were all thoroughly disinfected in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. India has culled 6.4 million birds due to bird flu since 2006. Experts point out that cross-infection to humans is still relatively rare and usually occurs where people have been in close contact with infected birds. But fears remain the aviation flu could combine with a human strain to produce a mutation that is more dangerous and difficult to control. In February, three people were tested for bird flu and 10,000 chickens slaughtered in Britain's first outbreak of the H7N7 strain in seven years. There have been several outbreaks of the H7N7 flu in China and 18 months ago it was found in Italy. During the Italian outbreak in August 2013, three poultry workers became infected with the virus, developing conjunctivitis. More than 1 million chickens and other poultry were culled during the Italian crisis.",

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

The fee-paying school's facilities manager Kevin Bird walked in on the pair while they were engaged in a sex act during an entrance exam day. Colin Turnbull (left), 69, was caught having sex with 'model' Rozina Khanim (pictured left and right) in a classroom at a \u00a313,000-a-year Catholic private school in Birmingham . Caught: Mr Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Ms Khanim by a governor at the school . The school was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and 39-year-old Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on. The teacher has worked at the school for nine years, hiring out a room to offer private tuition to pupils looking to pass the 11+, The Mirror reported. Mr Turnbull has not commented on the tryst, but the school confirmed senior staff had told him to 'never return'. A school spokeswoman said:\u00a0'Once Mr Turnbull's behaviour was discovered by the school's facilities manager, he promptly informed the assistant headteacher. 'Mr Turnbull was challenged; he fully admitted improper behaviour and was then instructed by the assistant headteacher to leave the school site immediately and to not return.' She added that the teacher was not directly employed by the school but he did hire out the classroom for tuition. 'As far as the school is concerned, while behaviour of the sort alleged is wholly unacceptable in any circumstances, we understand from the advice taken from social services that Mr Turnbull had not engaged in any illegal activity. The Priory School (pictured) was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on .

School regulator Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the Department for Education were all informed of the incident. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Independent schools must adhere to the Independent School Standards. Any suggestion that schools are not doing so will be investigated.' Sources close to the school, however, said Mr Turnbull had been allowed to 'leave by the back door' and were angered that he would be able to continue teaching. Ms Khanim declined to comment but told the Birmingham Mail: 'That's not how it all happened.' The Priory School is attended by around 400 pupils, from 'Nursery and Poppets' classes up until sixth form. It charges fees of up to \u00a312,870 a year for its most senior students. On the school's website, its headmaster Jonathan Cramb says 'knowing what is right and wrong' allows teachers to get on with providing an education for pupils. More than 80 per cent of students got five GCSEs graded A* to C last year, well above the national average.",

While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling\u2019s interview didn\u2019t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn\u2019t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I\u2019m hoping that that wasn\u2019t the whole point, as we\u2019ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: \u2018let him go\u2019. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money\u2019s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers . Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract . Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It\u2019s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there\u2019s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the \u00a3100,000-a-week contract he\u2019s turned down. But it\u2019s only that: potential. At present, he\u2019s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he\u2019s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn\u2019t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . And while I\u2019d be willing to see the club give him \u00a3100k a week \u2013 possibly \u00a3120k a week - the club shouldn\u2019t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I\u2019m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling\u2019s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he\u2019s welcome to. Personally, I don\u2019t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United . Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club . If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he\u2019s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we\u2019ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he\u2019s easily worth \u00a325-30 million. If I was FSG, I\u2019d hold any interested club to ransom, though \u2013 double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn\u2019t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there\u2019s little Arsenal can offer that we can\u2019t. Sure, they\u2019re more financially stable but what \u2013 in terms of trophies \u2013 do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract . I think we\u2019re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren\u2019t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he\u2019s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won\u2019t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

They topped a table of the most-loathed fees and charges in the poll by insurer Direct Line, followed by ATM cash withdrawal fees and debit and credit card surcharges for booking items such as air travel. Most-loathed: A poll found that parking charges topped the list of fees and charges that frustrate consumers the most. A total of 48 per cent thought they should be free, while 31 per cent said they are too high . Asked about their frustration with such charges, 48 per cent said they should be free, while 31 per cent thought they are too high and 15 per cent say they are often hidden. Direct Line spokesman Gus Park said: \u2018These types of fees and charges can be very frustrating because they tend to cover things that we either feel entitled to or think we have already paid for as part of another product or service.\u2019 It is hardly surprising that parking costs infuriate drivers as the fines are often extortionate compared to the price of a ticket.

Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a \"Most Wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's located in Kenya's North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\"  Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief.

A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Adam said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" He said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Adam said. Five arrested in Kenya attack . Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as those who supported them. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.",

A gambling addict stole more than \u00a322,000 from her grandmother's 98-year-old partner to blow on her scratchcard habit, a court heard. Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number,\u00a0cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into\u00a0care at Cedar House, Rothley. But the court heard that she abused that trust and began withdrawing up to \u00a3200 a day to feed her gambling habit. The 64-year-old admitted stealing \u00a322,650 from the elderly victim but was ordered to pay back just \u00a31,350 - which was all that remained of the stolen funds. The theft was  discovered after the deputy manager of the care home became suspicious that Stoneman's step-grandfather, Douglas Woodrow, was receiving a number of letters from the bank. On August 19, he asked a member of staff to open one of the letters which indicated the victim had no money left in his accounts. The care home alerted Lloyds Bank in Loughborough, where they noticed unauthorised cash\u00a0withdrawals had taken place from July 2013 and the police were contacted. Leicester Crown Court heard that Stoneman was 'solely responsible' and 'had been waiting for\u00a0the police.' She had also taken an overdose as a result, the court heard. The devastated victim, who had gone into the care home in Leicestershire after a number of falls, said he felt angry and betrayed by Stoneman. In a statement read to the court, Mr Woodrow said:\u00a0'She has stole money from my bank account which is my life savings. It is what I have paid for my care. 'I am so angry she has taken everything. I am angry at everyone. It has\u00a0really hurt me. 'I have worked hard all my life to be left with nothing.\u00a0'I can't trust anyone.' Defending Stoneman, who has no previous convictions, Vasanti Vaitha said:\u00a0'It was a relief when the police knocked on the door. She had been waiting\u00a0for it for a long time. 'She does take full responsibility - and realises the impact it has had on\u00a0the family. Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's financial affairs after he went into care at Cedar House, Rothley . 'This offence occurred from a gambling addiction while she was looking\u00a0after the victim's finances. Her gambling spiralled out of control. 'She tried to take her own life.' Judge Michael Fowler said: 'I know you understand the meanness and\u00a0seriousness of what you have done. 'It is more serious that Mr Woodrow trusted you. And the fact the funds you\u00a0took were funds he had accumulated over his life and depended on them to\u00a0some extent to pay for his care home fees. 'I can't ignore the fact that addictions do exist and there is no other\u00a0motivation.' She was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid\u00a0work and be part of a supervision requirement for 18 months. The judge also stated that \u00a31,350 would be confiscated for compensation and any sums recovered in the future should be paid to Mr Woodrow. Stoneman  was handed a suspended sentence of two years with 200 hours of unpaid work at Leicester Crown Court .",

Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days after her initial report to police saying she was groped by Weinstein during a 'business meeting' at his office in Manhattan. It has been claimed the delay was because the Italian model and her manager were working behind the scenes to try and land her a film role. But once the 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to pursue the criminal case, sources told the New York Post. See below for video . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan last Friday night . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . After filing her police report on Friday, March 27, Battilana was eventually interviewed by Manhattan DA prosecutors on Wednesday, April 1, at the NYPD Special Victims Squad's office in East Harlem. Sources told the New York Post her former lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, withdrew from the case as he was concerned Battilana did not appear to be a 'serious victim'. The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and even tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat. But her new lawyer, David Godosky, refuted the claims, saying: 'She immediately went to the police, immediately cooperating with the Special Victims Squad.' Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse yesterday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Weinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall. The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night. She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported. Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'",

Julia Van Herck, 42, from Fulham, West London, underwent surgery after ballooning to 23 stone after tying the knot with\u00a0Stefan in 1993. She wore a size 26 to size 28 and would regularly comfort eat tubs of ice-cream and family-sized pizzas because she was scared that her husband might leave her. Mum-of-three Julia Van Herck gained 12 stone (left, at her heaviest) after binge eating following post-natal depression and amid fears that her husband would leave her. She has since slimmed down to 11 stone (right) Julia (pictured above with actor and singer Darius Campbell) admits she used food as an 'emotional crutch' and would stash snacks away in hidden places so her family wouldn't discover her secret . Battling bouts of post-natal depression after having her children, Julia says she would sneak downstairs at night and gorge on calorie-laden treats, fearful her life was falling apart and she was going to split with Stefan. The fears proved unfounded and a health scare finally prompted her to lose weight. Julia said a turning point came in October 2012 when she contracted pneumonia and was taken to Charing Cross Hospital in London. 'I was pumped full of antibiotics and developed painful thrush all over my body,' she said. 'It was in my fingers, feet and mouth. 'It didn't clear for ages.' It was while she was in hospital that doctors offered her weight-loss surgery. Julia now weighs a healthy 11 stone and is a size 12. 'I used food as an emotional crutch,' she admits. 'My husband is from Belgium and when I married him in 1993 I went from a slim 11.5 stone to 18 stone within two years. 'I was homesick and I just kept eating. I suffered with post-natal depression and every time I had a child my binge eating worsened.' Julia says that a communication breakdown with her Stefan led her to devour her favourite snacks and by 2011, she'd reached rock bottom. 'There was no communication between me and my husband and I was really isolated. Food was my friend and I needed a friend. So I binged.' Julia can once again fit into the gown that she wore at her wedding to Stefan in 1993 (left) when she weighed 11.5 stone. The slimmer, who underwent weight loss surgery, says she's a new woman, right . Julia feared her life was falling apart and used food as a way of escaping her woes . Mum to Zachary, ten, Ciaran, 16, and Letitia, 19, Julia gorged on sugary foods. 'I was heavily addicted to sugar. Biscuits, cakes, ice-cream...I loved it all. The only savoury thing I ate was pizza. If I was on a binge cycle I would eat crisps and cereal.' The situation got so bad that Julia would hide food from her family so they were unaware of how bad her eating had got. 'I hid food in the medicine cabinet so my family didn't know what I was doing.They didn't know I was buying extra. Looking back my husband must have been aware. The carer described her eating as 'a form of self-harm'. 'Ice cream was my biggest splurge,' she said. 'I would eat a family-sized pizza and two tubs of ice cream in an hour. I couldn't stop.' Doctors agreed that Julia could be a candidate for weight loss surgery but first they said that she had to shed some pounds. So, in January 2013 she started only drinking juice. She was inspired by the story of Joe Cross, an Australian who weighed more than 22 stone but lost more than seven stone by sticking to a juice diet. He wrote a book, Fat, Sick And Nearly Dead, which Mrs Van Herck heard about. 'This led to me losing weight and wanting to eat fruit and vegetables,' she said. 'I even started exercising.' Just look at us now: Julia and husband Stefan decided they wanted to stay together and Julia realised that all the fears that she'd had were just down to a lack of confidence . Life overhaul: Julia now eats healthier foods and even goes to the gym and has a new wardrobe . By October 2013 she was four stone lighter and doctors agreed she could undergo weight loss surgery at St Mary's Hospital in London, which proved successful. Now she weighs 11 stone and loves healthy food. She never binges. 'I realised I had been causing myself pain by eating,' she said. 'Now I am much happier. I buy smaller clothes and feel confident in myself.' And to prove just how far she has come, Julia has stepped back into her bridal gown after rekindling her relationship with Stefan. 'I spoke to my husband and he didn't want to split up. It was in my head because I wasn't confident. 'I've stopped taking anti-depressants for the first time in my life.' The sky's the limit now, it seems: 'I've even started going to the gym and can now run much further than I used to be able to walk without losing breath. I'm a new woman.' The NHS said: 'Binge eating is an eating disorder where a person feels compelled to overeat on a regular basis through regular binges. 'People who binge eat consume very large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when they are not hungry. 'Binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying 'special' binge foods.' Joe Cross' new film Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2 will air on Channel 5, 7pm on  April 21.",

Diwalinen Vankar, 58, had gone with her 19-year-old daughter Kanta, to the bank of the Vishwamitri River, 40 kilometres from Vadodara, in west India, to wash their clothes. As they were wringing out their laundry, a mugger crocodile grabbed Kanta's right leg and dragged her into the murky river. Diwalinen Vankar, 58, (pictured left) fought off a 13ft crocodile with a washing paddle after it attacked her 19-year-old daughter Kanta (right) A crocodile grabbed\u00a0Diwalinen Vankar's daughter's legs on the banks of the\u00a0Vishwamitri River in west India and dragged her into the river - her mother rescued her by hitting it with a washing paddle (stock image) The sudden attack rattled Vankar, who hastily grabbed her daughter's hand to try and pull her free from the clutches of the crocodile. But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch. 'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said. 'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go. 'It took me 10 minutes to finally free her from its jaws.' Kanta suffered a leg injury after the crocodile grabbed her right leg and dragged her into the murky river . This map shows the Vishwamitri River, near Vadodara, where the attack by the crocodile took place . Vankar said she went to wash her clothes in the river as there was a lack of water and electricity in the village . After hearing the commotion, villagers rushed to help and drove Kanta to hospital, where doctors were treated her for a leg injury. She has since been discharged. Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.' She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return. A wildlife officer said the river is home to ferocious crocodiles and villagers have been warned to steer clear of the river. 'She has miraculously survived. These crocodiles are huge and ferocious,' Ashok Pandya, Vadodara wildlife officer told the Times of India. 'We have been warning them not to go near the river.' Last year, six people were killed in crocodile attacks across Vadodara. There are more than 200 crocodiles in the\u00a0Vishwamitri River.

Dai Young\u2019s side became the third of four English challengers to be dispatched from Europe\u2019s premier event over a punishing weekend, but this was no meek capitulation. Despite the chronic inconvenience of losing Nathan Hughes to a contentious ban and Christian Wade to an untimely injury, the visitors raged gallantly against the dying of the light.

Penalties: Lozowski (2) Referee: George Clancy (Ireland) Toulon are back-to-back continental champions, awash with Test talent, but they were given a scare by their tenacious opponents \u2014 and even forced to adopt sly, illegal tactics to survive a second-half fightback. Seven minutes from full-time amid a cacophony at Stade Felix Mayol, Wasps launched a daring raid from their own 22 which eventually culminated in a second try for Will Helu, but it also featured a miscarriage of justice. Former All Black lock Ali Williams pulled back Elliot Daly off the ball as he ran clear in support of Joe Simpson. It was surely one of the most obvious offences of its type ever committed in the sport, yet Williams not only avoided a yellow card, but he was on hand to touch down three minutes from time for the try which distorted the final scoreline. Wasps were left battered and beaten, but richly deserving of the ovations from their pockets of supporters around the ground. Captain James Haskell\u2019s work-load was worthy of three men and Andrea Masi also gave body and soul to the cause, while Simpson and Daly were outstanding. Toulon playmaker Frederic Michalak pulls the strings for the defending European champions . Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Toulon fans celebrate after the opening try from their giant French centre Mathieu Bastareaud .

Young was delighted with how his side had performed, once they stopped being so deferential. \u2018I\u2019m really proud of the effort and the commitment,\u2019 he said. \u2018There was real frustration in the first half, because we gave them a bit too much respect in the first 30 minutes. We were a little bit frantic, a little bit panicky, but we will learn from that and I thought we played some really good stuff on occasions. I\u2019m pleased that we were in it right to the end.\u2019 Wasps defence descend on Toulon's Guilhem Guirado at the Felix Mayol Stadium on Sunday . Toulon speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground .

The Top 14 leaders went into the break 22-6 up, but Wasps turned the tables as Daly scorched down the right to tee up Helu\u2019s first try. Michalak\u2019s sixth penalty appeared to settle the holders, but Helu touched down for the second time after another crucial intervention by the outstanding Daly. When Williams went over to quell the uprising moments later, it secured Toulon a semi-final against Leinster in Marseille, and left Wasps to head home craving another shot at this tournament next season.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe distinctive patterns on butterfly wings really do help protect the insects by mimicking the eyes of predators. While scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry, it has never been clearly tested. Recently researchers suggested that the eye spots may simply scare away predators by confusing them or overloading their senses. Owl butterflies (left) have eye spots that mimic those of pigmy owls (right) to scare off predators like great tits.\u00a0While scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry, it has never been clearly tested . But a new piece of research by biologists at Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 University in Finland claims to have settled the debate. They say that eye-spots on the wings of butterflies do in fact mimic the eyes of larger and more threatening species, like owls. Having bright colours and distinguishing features is a common way for insects to scare away predators like birds. Often they help to lure them away from vital body parts or confuse them. However, this only works on predators that hunt using sight while bats tend to be immune to such devices. Now scientists have found that a moth has an unusual evolutionary adaptation that allows it to confuse the ultrasound used by bats. The luna moth has two tails that extend for more than an inch beyond its body. Scientists in the US showed that these appendages produce a confusing acoustic signature in the bats echolocation. It makes the bats target the end of the tails rather than the moth itself. This helps to keep other birds that might normally eat the insects away. The team were finally able to test the theory by showing great tits pictures of owl butterflies that had been digitally altered, and watching their reaction. Images where the eye spots had been removed from the butterfly wings did not stop the birds from snatching a mealworm snack below the picture. However, when pictures that had not been digitally altered flashed on the screen, the birds were more weary. And the researchers found the butterfly eye spots may even be more terrifying to the great tits than the real animal they are mimicking. When shown pictures of a pygmy owl with its eyes open the tits reacted strongly and kept away, but their reaction was not as strong as with the butterfly markings. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr Johanna Mappes and her colleagues said: 'In this study, the presumed model - owl eyes - and the mimic eyespots appeared to elicit similar reactions both in terms of response type - interest versus aversion - and its intensity - startle versus flee - adding support to the eye-mimicry hypothesis. The researchers flashed up digitally manipulated images of an owls face and the owl butterfly to see how great tits reacted. In some images they removed the owls eyes (far left) or removed the eye spots (far right) Eye spots are a common feature on butterfly wings, like the\u00a0Bycyclus anyana butterfly above, but scientists have been divided over whether they were intended to mimic other predators or simply confuse predators . 'Predator-prey interactions in nature often involve dynamic encounters between the partners, and eye spots are more likely to appear suddenly in front of the predator. 'Their intimidating effect has been proved to increase when they are revealed abruptly. 'We therefore conclude that it is unlikely that the adaptive value of eye spots is due to sensory or information overload caused by the conspicuousness of colour pattern.' The researchers conducted their experiments by placing wild captured great tits into a cage where the floor had been fitted with a computer monitor. The birds were offered a dead mealworm and as they approached an image was flashed up on the computer screen. Images of owl eyes caused the birds to be startled, flee and in some cases give off alarm calls. but images of owls without eyes did not produce the same reaction. Atlas moths (above) have colourful patterns on their wings that are thought to mimic the head of a cobra . A cobra poses a far greater threat to a predator than an Atlas moth and so by mimicking the reptile with the patterns on its wings the moth is able to scare off potential hunters that might make it a tasty snack . However when the birds were shown images of the owl butterfly, they were also scared away. If the irises of the eye spots were removed, or the eye spots removed altogether, then they were scared away far less often. Many species of butterfly have eye-spots as part of the pattern on their wings. The Atlas butterfly, for example, has a pattern that looks like the head of a cobra. Some entomologists have also claimed that the Eyed hawk moth look like the head of a fox when viewed from the front. In one extreme example of mimicry, the caterpillar of the Eastern tiger swallowtail looks like a snake and spits a foul smelling chemical to keep away predators. Last year scientists at Oregon State University looked at the butterfly Bycyclus anyana and showed that it varies the intensity of its eye spots depending on the season. They claimed bright colours in the rainy season allowed the butterfly to confuse the dominant predators - preying mantids - while duller colours in the dry season helped them hide from birds. Some entomologists claim the eyed hawk moth looks like the face of a fox or dog from the front . The wing patterns of the eyed hawk moth is said to resemble the dark nose and the light coloured eyes of a fox .",

Council inspectors found a shocking state of hygiene at The Steer Inn in Wilberfoss, East Yorkshire - and owner David Crossfield later admitted 17 charges of breaching food safety regulations. Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date. Shocking:\u00a0Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy (above) and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date . In addition, raw meat was being prepared in direct contact with ready to eat salad items posing a serious risk of cross contamination, Beverley Magistrates\u2019 Court was told. Inspectors - who first visited in January 2014 - also found kitchen equipment was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair, and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning. Meanwhile food safety systems, monitoring checks and procedures were not in place - and food handlers were found to consistently demonstrate a lack of understanding of food safety issues. Crossfield, 52, of Elvington, North Yorkshire - whom magistrates branded \u2018foolish\u2019 - also admitted failing to comply with a hygiene improvement notice requiring food hygiene training for his staff. Mouldy food and dirty floor: Inspectors found kitchen equipment at The Steer Inn was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning . Crossfield said he was the sole director of The Steer Inn (Pocklington) Ltd and had admitted he had taken over the running of the premises with no knowledge of running a kitchen or a restaurant. He said he had been worked in pubs and bars \u2018with no problems before\u2019 and he had been \u2018naive\u2019 and had been led to believe the chef had the right qualifications relating to food hygiene. Crossfield told the court that The Steer Inn had ceased trading on New Year\u2019s Eve 2014 and that he was in the process of liquidating the company, which had no assets. Chair of the bench Graham McDonald told him: \u2018These were appalling offences.\u00a0People could have become seriously ill or even died as a result of salmonella. East Yorkshire restaurant:\u00a0The company was fined \u00a38,500, plus costs of \u00a31,392 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120. Its owner was individually fined \u00a32,750, as well as costs of \u00a31,392 and a \u00a3120 victim surcharge . \u2018Your naivety was dangerous and the fact you relied on your chef was extremely foolish.\u2019 The company was fined \u00a38,500, plus costs of \u00a31,392 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120. Crossfield was individually fined \u00a32,750, as well as costs of \u00a31,392 and a \u00a3120 victim surcharge. Paul Abbott, manager for public protection at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said: \u2018The council\u2019s food safety team had offered considerable advice to the food business operator of the premises in an attempt to produce safe food but despite being rated a zero under the food hygiene rating scheme, he had failed to make meaningful improvements. He added that the council \u2018will always try to work with businesses to ensure the food they sell is safe and they are compliant with the relevant legislation'.",

Scroll down for video . What a square! A dog shows off Taiwan's bizarre new pet-grooming trend after having his fur cut in a square . Hairdresser Tain Yeh, 42, who runs a parlour in Taipei said: 'I am aware of the trend although we don't have much request for it here because it's very difficult to keep the shape. 'It came about because people were always looking for more impressive haircuts, and somebody came up with the idea of shaping the dog like a hedge.' Pictures of doe-eyed dogs with their shapely new cuts have proved extremely popular online prompting more owners to seek out the custom salons. Many are now opting for the cuts simply to get more likes and shares on social media sites. Ms Yeh added: 'The dogs don't mind, and the owners keep coming back for more. This sort of haircut needs a lot more maintenance then the regular type. 'It is also not suitable for all breeds. The dog needs to have plenty of hair to play around with so that you can shape it around the face and body.' Willing customers? Two more recently-groomed pooches stare sad-eyed into the camera as they show off new hairstyles .

Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, launched a scathing attack on current title-holder Indianara Carvalho, claiming the model had 'revealed  who she truly is'. Miss Carvalho, 23, posted the racy picture to her Instagram account on Good Friday - the day the country's 130million Catholics solemnly remembered the crucifixion and death of Christ. Scroll down for video . Racy:\u00a0Indianara Carvalho posted the picture of her naked body painted with an image of the Virgin Mary on Good Friday . Slammed: Claudia Alende, who came second in the competition, launched a scathing attack on Miss Carvalho . The image, one of a series of nude shots she shared over the Easter weekend, was accompanied with a prayer which including the words: 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength'. But the paintings - created by Brazilian spray-paint artist Binho over 10 hours - prompted a tirade of disapproval from her followers, many of whom accused the Miss BumBum winner of disrespect and religious sacrilege. Ms Alende, the competition's vice champion,  better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', today waded into the furore, claiming she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqu\u00e9 Easter stunt. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Ms Alende, a Catholic, claimed she had also been asked to do the photoshoot but refused 'out of respect for God and for my family'. She said: 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her.' Claudia Alende, 21, who came second in last year's beauty pageant, is known as the Brazilian Megan Fox . Ms Alende, better known as the Brazilian 'Megan Fox', claims she had been left 'shocked and ashamed' by her rival's risqu\u00e9 Easter stunt . Ms Alende said: 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is' 'Our Lady is a holy figure, and for many the most important figure in their lives,' she added. 'To paint her across your naked body, especially on Good Friday, shows a breathtaking lack of respect and judgement. 'Like most other people, I was shocked when I saw the photos. I was actually embarrassed for her, even though she has no shame herself. 'I think in her head she doesn't care if it makes people talk well or talk badly of her. She just wants people to talk about her. She thinks that any kind of publicity is a good thing. 'I've always known that the woman is an attention-seeking sl*t, and now she's revealing to everyone else who she truly is.' Brazilian beauty: Ms Alende claims Miss Carvalho has 'revealed who she truly is' by posting the naked shots . Ms Alende believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her rival . The Miss BumBum runner-up told MailOnline 'It was a ridiculous thing to do, I actually feel ashamed for her' Ms Alende said the current Miss BumBum - who had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time again with 'someone special' - never deserved to win the coveted title last November. She said: 'I honestly have no idea how she won. She is too muscly, it means her body is ugly, she certainly doesn't represent the Brazilian woman.' And she believes the publicity stunt is already backfiring - and called on Brazilians to boycott her. 'She has made people see her in a negative way, so many are losing respect for her and interest in her too,' Ms Alende added. 'She is losing her credibility, and will lose work too. 'I think anyone who was shocked by her lack of respect for Christianity and the Virgin Mary should boycott her, including magazines and companies that might have used her image on their pages or to sell their products.'

Following the publication of the photos at the weekend, many of Miss Carvalho's Instagram followers expressed their outrage. 'Don\u2019t mix God with your ridiculous shame and profanity,' wrote one Instagram user, Eliane Paz Salinas. Another, Cadmo Barrera Lerma ranted: 'You have lost my total respect, at least one in your list of followers.' Janvier Veliz Angulo added: 'This proves that beauty is not everything\u2026 you have lost me as one of your fans.' Referring to Miss Carvalho's accompanying prayer, another user fumed: 'I think that to ask for peace and love and protection there is no need to be naked!!!! Please respect things related to God!' Happy Easter: This was another of the raunchy photographs posted on social media by the Miss BumBum winner . Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth'' The 2014 contest was marred by scandal after it was alleged that Miss Carvalho had bribed the judges with over \u00a370,000 in cash to make sure she won . Christianity is the dominant religion in Brazil, with Roman Catholics accounting for 64 per cent of the population and Protestants making up 22 per cent, according to the latest Census. Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nHong Kong (CNN)An impressive art collection assembled by the late actress and Hollywood icon, Lauren Bacall, has officially been offered for purchase. The collection, which includes works by some of the greatest artists of the 20th century, went under the hammer in New York on March 31, following a tour of Hong Kong, Paris, London and Los Angeles. Bacall, who died in August 2014 at the age of 89, first shot to international fame in 1944 with her first film, \"To Have And Have Not.\" That was also when the husky-voiced starlet met her future husband, Humphrey Bogart. At the recent 2015 Golden Globes, George Clooney paid tribute to the silver screen queen in his award winning speech. \"I don't remember what awards Lauren Bacall won, I just remember her saying: 'You know how to whistle, don't you Steve. You just put your lips together and blow.'\" said Clooney, referring to one of her most legendary lines from her first movie. The 750-piece collection, which fetched a total of $3.64 million, featured bronze sculptures, jewelry, and a number of decorative arts and paintings, which were sold at Bonhams auction house in New York. \"Her collection is truly a reflection of her extraordinary taste and remarkable life,\" said Jon King, Bonhams' vice president. Among the 50 items highlighted in the auction preview were six bronze maquettes by Henry Moore, Britain's greatest 20th century sculptor and one of Bacall's favorite artists, whom she developed a close relationship with. One of them sold for close to $120,000. Also for sale were some of Bacall's most loved jewelry pieces, created by legendary French designer Jean Schlumberger, most known for his work at Tiffany & Co. A rose diamond camel brooch by British jeweler Elizabeth Gage fetched $23,750 and was accompanied by the original drawing and correspondence from the designer, which shows the close-knit relationship Bacall had with Gage. The wide-ranging collection was expected to appeal to a variety of collectors: fine arts and antiques dealers, fans of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, as well as memorabilia enthusiasts. Most of the items auctioned come from the apartment in New York's Dakota Building that she shared with her second husband, actor Jason Robards, until 1969. But King said fans of Humphrey Bogart would have been pleased to know some of the items were also from their shared residence in Los Angeles. King, who got to know Bacall in her late years, said the collection reflects the actress' eclectic taste, and there was only one principle she applied to collecting: . \"Everything had to kind of speak to her, to catch her eye. She loved form, she loved texture, she loved color. And she loved mixing it all up. She said that when you walked into her house, what she liked was that it was never boring,\" King said. \"You could walk into the same room a hundred times, and see something new every time.\"",

But this is actually a mocked-up image of Britain\u2019s ideal dog, comprising different parts of several breeds to create the perfect furry friend. The coat of an English bulldog, the ears of a King Charles spaniel and the tail of an Irish setter help make up a set of ideal characteristics voted for by 2,000 pet owners. The perfect dog also has the body size of a border collie, the snout of a labrador and the eyes of a beagle. Scroll down for video . The dog has all the best bits from the UK's favourite breeds, the hair of an English Bulldog and a Labrador nose . The research found more than a third of owners wanted their dog to have a short, low-maintenance coat, while a similar proportion favoured soft, floppy ears. Almost half said their ideal dog would be \u2018standard-sized\u2019 like a collie, compared with 36 per cent who preferred smaller lap dogs such as chihuahuas. The \u2018soft and round\u2019 snout of a labrador was the most favourable nose, with 50 per cent of the vote, beating the elongated snout of a collie which was chosen by 24 per cent. When it came to naming their pets, 29 per cent of owners said they opted for \u2018human\u2019 choices such as Dave or Lucy.

But slightly more \u2013 33 per cent \u2013 preferred traditional dogs\u2019 names including Rover and Bailey. The survey, by flea treatment brand Frontline Spot On, also found that people favoured different types of dog depending on where they lived. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 41 per cent of Londoners preferred small dogs who don\u2019t take up much room. Meanwhile almost a fifth of owners in East Anglia, with its swathes of countryside, picked the large great dane as their favourite breed. Our 'perfect dog' has the body of a Border Collie (right) but the Great Dane was most popular in East Anglia . Voters in different areas preferred their dogs larger or smaller, depending on the region where they lived . Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) rather than a retriever-sized pooch (34 per cent). Meanwhile, those in East Anglia prefer Great Danes (19 per cent) over tiny dogs like Chihuahuas (4 per cent). A quarter of owners valued their pet\u2019s companionship so much they said the perfect dog would live for as long as they did \u2013 instead of the normal lifespan of around ten to 13 years. The survey also asked about the ideal dog\u2019s sound, with 30 per cent opting for the \u2018mid-range\u2019 bark of a labrador as opposed to a high-pitched yap. Brock Abreu, Frontline Spot On brand manager, said: \u2018When it comes to our ideal canine companion, looks really do matter. \u2018It is also great to see that we are being patriotic and championing those traditional and beautiful British dog breeds.\u2019 Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) than a larger retreiver .",

Odegaard opted to join Real Madrid after courting interest from a host of top clubs in Europe, including Manchester United and Liverpool, and signed a long-term \u00a340,000 a week contract with the Champions League winners in January. The former Stromgodset playmaker has trained with Carlo Ancelotti's first team regularly since his arrival, rubbing shoulder's with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.

There have been suggestions that his presence in the side has riled team-mates that feel Odegaard training with the first team three times a week means he lacks cohesion in the B team. Real Madrid are desperate for the Castilla side to win promotion to the second tier of Spanish football and Zidane has to decide whether that goal is more attainable without the young talent.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia. In a documentary aired today  on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying. Putin also expressed his fears that the West wishes Russia harm as he recalled how some world leaders told him they would not mind Russia's possible disintegration. 'My counterparts, a lot of presidents and prime ministers told me later on that they had decided for themselves by then that Russia would cease to exist in its current form,' he said. 'The only question was when it happens and what consequences would be.'",

The 28-year-old won her third successive doubles title with Hingis, beating Casey Dellacqua and Darija Jurak 6-0, 6-4 in just 57 minutes, to achieve the top ranking milestone. 'When you start off as a child playing tennis, you dream of being No 1 in the world. It's a dream for every person; very few get there. I feel extremely honoured to be No1, it's something that I've worked for all my life,' Mirza said in a statement. Sania Mirza (left) and Martina Hingis celebrate their victory at the Family Circle Cup on Sunday . Mirza celebrates after clinching victory with partner Hingis in the Charleston tournament . 'I hope this makes girls in India believe that anything is possible; we can achieve anything we want if we put our mind and body to it.' Mirza had once been tipped for success as a singles player after she became the first Indian to win a WTA singles title in 2005. She followed up her success in her hometown of Hyderabad by reaching the fourth round of the U.S. Open in 2005 and two years later broke into the top 30. But from then on her singles career went into freefall, with injuries taking a toll. On the doubles court, however, her career prospered as she became the first Indian woman to claim a grand slam title when she partnered Mahesh Bhupathi to the 2009 Australian Open mixed doubles crown. Mirza (left) cuts the cake after sealing top spot in the WTA doubles rankings . Indian fans in the stands celebrate as Mirza wins the title with Hingis on Sunday . When the new WTA rankings are released on Monday, Mirza's run of winning 14 successive doubles matches with Hingis will see her leapfrog Italians Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci at the top of the standings. 'It is a truly remarkable accomplishment for Sania Mirza to become the first Indian woman to reach the WTA World No.1 doubles ranking,' WTA Chairman and CEO Stacey Allaster said. 'Sania has attained many milestones throughout her successful career and this achievement is a fitting recognition of her talent, dedication and success. Mirza has her eye on the ball as she plays a forehand during the final in Charleston . Hingis crouches at the net before going on to seal victory with Mirza in the green-clay event . 'I am sure Sania will continue to create history and inspire our ever-growing fan base in India and the wider Asia-Pacific region.' Only three other Asian women have achieved the top WTA doubles ranking: Japan's Ai Sugiyama, China's Peng Shuai and Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei. Leander Paes and Bhupathi are the only other Indians to achieve number one rankings in tennis when they dominated men's doubles in the late 1990s.",

Police in Ragusa, a Sicilian port town, arrested three Syrian men who were at the helm of the Turkish-flagged yacht attempting to reach the Italian coast. It is thought the smugglers had charged each person $8,500 (\u00a35,700) to make the crossing, with police saying the total earned by the organisers was somewhere in the region of \u00a3536,000. Scroll down for video . The luxury yacht, which was flying a Turkish flag, was stopped as it approached Europe with a 'cargo' which is thought to have been worth $800,000 - or \u00a3536,000 - to the organisers . This is far more than the usual cost of\u00a0between 1,000 and 1,500 euros - \u00a3720 to \u00a31,080 - to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. However, the boat was far more seaworthy than some of the other vessels used, which can be anything from\u00a0wooden fishing vessels to old cargo ships. Yet even the yacht failed to make the journey in its entirety: the attempt was discovered when two merchant ships were called out to aid a boat in distress. Selfies and other photos snapped by the Syrian and Palestinian passengers helped police identify the smugglers, police said in a statement. Police also revealed there were 23 children on bard the yacht. Harroum Almotassem Billah,\u00a0Haj Slima Moustafa and\u00a0Sabaj Ahmmed were all arrested for allegedly being part of the crew. Harroum Almotassem Billah, one of the three Syrians that were taken in custody by police for allegedly being part of the crew which was at the helm of the yacht . Haj Slima Moustafa was also taken into custody after the yacht - filled with Syrian and Palestinian migrants who paid $8,500 each for the journey - called for help as it approached the coast . Sabaj Ahmmed was the third member of the alleged crew attempting to bring the migrants, including 23 children, to Europe . The boat is the latest vessel to be stopped making the dangerous crossing from north Africa to Europe, packed with migrants desperate to start a new life. But many of the trips end in tragedy: so far this year, 1,776 have died, according to the U.N. refugee agency, which estimates that 219,000 people made the crossing in 2014. On Sunday alone, 900 men, women and children are believed to have died after their boat got into difficulty and overturned off Libyan waters, south of the southern Italian island of Lampedusa. There were only 28 survivors. These infrared images show the rescue operation after migrant ship capsized on Sunday . Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . Doctor Giuseppe Pomilla, of the Order of Malta, described the three hours he searched for the living among hundreds of dead floating corpses. He told the MailOnline: 'It was like a nightmare. It was a cemetery. There were bodies everywhere you looked.'",

But it is how Washington wants this to be. And even though the departure of American troops will be fractionally slower, they will all be inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year, making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire. We are near Jalalabad, at a regional logistics hub for the Afghan police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms, ammunition, even fuel for vehicles. The intentions, first hatched in 2011 when the U.S. had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here, were large in scale. But the project has been handed between rotations of U.S. officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception. We are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks. Dozens of Afghan police gather there, and mill around, waiting for their commanders to arrive. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: Afghan forced to marry her rapist . Yet a few problems are immediately visible. There are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we're told they've been removed while a new master key is being sought. There seem to be few supplies in the actual hub. We ask the Afghan policemen how many of them get resupplied there, at this stage, four months since it opened, and they say: none. About 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base, but supplies often still come from where they did before -- Kabul. U.S. officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the Afghan army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need. But here, now, that seems far away. As does the base, incidentally. It's quite a rough drive from the main road, surrounded by hills, and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub. Nick Paton Walsh's Afghanistan series: ISIS recruits in Taliban territory . And it is far away in terms of its cost. Like so much in the most costly of wars, its price tag may have made sense in briefings on Capitol Hill, where effectiveness is gauged in millions, but here in dusty eastern Afghanistan, it seems exorbitant. This as-yet, partially functional resupply hub cost $21 million, a price that presumably includes new doorhandles. There are about fifty Afghan police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $400,000 to the US taxpayer. But this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the U.S. trainers here face: working, as they are, against a clock, with diminishing resources and public interest, in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where, when the Taliban aren't thriving, ISIS are waiting in the wings to fill the gap. With the clock ticking in the background, U.S. officer Colonel JB Vowell remains upbeat: \"It's going to be a challenge, to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance, supplies, resupply. I'm optimistic though; much of this didn't exist in November.\" On the outskirts of the base are the relics of the U.S.'s military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill Afghan security forces at an accelerated  rate. SUVs, even old American Humvees -- now gifted to Afghan police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes. The Americans were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here, assess their resupply needs, or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts. Throughout, the surreal changes in how this war was, and continues to be, fought are omnipresent. Years ago, the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an American base. Now we are far from the threat, but another has taken its place. Surrounding our crew at all times are \"Guardian Angels\" -- U.S. soldiers on guard duty, protecting their own from rogue Afghan police or soldiers, trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- \"green on blue\" attacks, in which Afghan security forces turn their guns on Americans. It is a strange experience to be protected from those who America seeks to hand the country over to. But this is how the war ended. Not with ideological victories, or dramatic withdrawals, just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side.",

During a lesson on tolerance and acceptance, children at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point were read I Am Jazz, a book about\u00a0a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender. Some parents are unhappy with the school after they say their children came home with questions about gender and wondering if they too might be trans. I Am Jazz is a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender . One unnamed mom was so angry she contacted conservative pundit Sean Hannity after she felt that the school ignored her initial complaint. 'I feel like my thoughts, feelings and beliefs were completely ignored\u2026.My right as a parent to allow or not allow this discussion with my child was taken from me. It is very upsetting to me that I didn't have an option at all,' she told\u00a0Hannity.com. 'When I spoke with the principal he was very cold about it. It's amazing how thoughtless the school has been with this whole thing.' The mother claims that lesson prompted her 7-year-old son to start asking a lot of questions and questioning if he might be trans - something that he had never previously spoken about. 'I was taken aback by it\u2026 Being seven, once you put something in their mind they don't forget so easily,' she said. In the wake of Hannity contacting the school asking for clarity, officals have now apologized. Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, said she supported the reading of the book but admitted that parents should have been first notified. Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues . Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, admitted that parents should have been first notified . 'We have a practice of if a topic is considered sensitive, parents should be informed. In this situation, that didn't happen,' she said. 'The whole culture at Mitchell School is about teaching tolerance and respect. The people presenting the lesson thought [I Am Jazz] was one more piece of teaching that lesson. In retrospect, we understand that toleration is tolerating people of all opinions.' But at least one parents has come out in support of the school's initial decision to select the book as appropiate for teaching young students. 'People in this country, parents in this country are outraged by bullying, teen suicide rates and the depression in children. The staff of Mitchell School is doing something about this. By teaching acceptance and love they are shedding a light on [LGBTI] issues,' reports Gay Star News. 'LGBTQ issues should never be classified as a \"sensitive subject\" \u2014 there is nothing sensitive about the way we are born. Blonde hair, brown hair, gay, straight or somewhere in-between, we are all people and we all need acceptance.' The book at the center of the controversy, I Am Jazz, is based off of the life of now 14-year-old Jazz Jennings who, although born a boy, claims to have identified as a girl since he was two-years-old. 'From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing,' reads the book's description on Amazon.com. 'This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers.'",

During the interview with conservative talk show host, Mike Gallagher, the 67-year-old was asked: 'Have you seen Kelly Clarkson? You know the singer, Kelly Clarkson? Holy cow, did she blow up.' In reply, he said the 'American Idol' winner has 'a lovely voice', but added that she 'could stay off the deep dish pizza for a while'. Within minutes, Wallace's response had sparked outrage online. Now, the veteran news man has apologized for his 'offensive' remarks - which he made on the nationally-syndicated Mike Gallagher Show on Friday - in a statement obtained by DailyMail.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR 'FAT SHAMING' INTERVIEW . Firestorm: Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace (right), 67, faced wide-spread criticism after fat shaming Kelly Clarkson (left) on Friday, saying the singer and new mom could 'stay off the deep dish pizza for a while' Dealing with it: The same day, Kelly Clarkson told chat show host Ellen DeGeneres that she's had to deal with criticism about her weight since she first hit the spotlighton the first season of American Idol in 2002 . In the statement, Wallace said: 'I sincerely apologize to Kelly Clarkson for my offensive comment. I admire her remarkable talent and that should have been the focus of any discussion about her.' Clarkson, who coincidentally spoke of criticism about her weight on\u00a0The Ellen DeGeneres Show\u00a0the same day, is married to talent manager Brandon Blackstock. They have a nine-month-old girl, River. Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, 60-year-old Greta Van Susteren, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to\u00a0Gallagher. 'This \"guy snickering\" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote. Meanwhile, Twitter users condemned Wallace for his 'disgusting' remarks. One wrote: 'Chris Wallace you're disgusting how dare you fat shame a woman who gave birth less than a year ago.' During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Clarkson\u00a0revealed that since she appeared on 'American Idol' in 2002, she has had to  deal with people being mean about her body shape. On Kelly's side: Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, Greta Van Susteren (above), 60, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Mike Gallagher . Tweet: 'This \"guy snickering\" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote . Mom-and-baby bag: Ellen surprised Kelly, whose daughter River was born in June 2014, with a baby bag that dispenses 'mommy juice' after the singer said she sometimes prefers wine to workouts on Friday's show . 'I was the biggest girl in the show, too. And I wasn\u2019t big, but people would call me big. Because I was the biggest one on Idol and I\u2019ve kind of always gotten that,' she told the  host. Referring to British TV personality, Katie Hopkins, who has tweeted a string of rude comments about her, she added: 'People are like, I\u2019m so sorry that lady in London was so mean to you. 'I\u2019m like, are you serious?\u00a0Like\u00a0get in line.' In an interview with Access Hollywood in early March, Hopkins, 40, defended her position on the Heartbeat Song artist, declaring that 'ultimately, Kelly Clarkson is a chunky monkey.' Proud mom: The singer brought along her adorable nine-month-old daughter River and introduced her to the comedienne backstage at The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Happy and successful: Kelly's new album Piece By Piece debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Chart, making it her third number one album . But Clarkson told Ellen she feels bad not for herself but for other woman. 'I think what hurts my feelings... is that I\u2019ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you\u2019re big, I must be so fat to them\", she said. The new mother, who gave birth to her daughter in June 2014, revealed on the popular TV chat show that she takes a philosophical approach to comments about what she looks like. 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' the 32-year-old said. She added: 'I\u2019m such a creative person that I\u00a0yoyo.\u00a0So sometimes I\u2019m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don\u2019t and I\u2019m like.. I\u2019d rather have wine.'",

The wraps came off the prototype of the new 10th generation car at the New York International motor show. It came just a day after it was announced that Swindon in Wiltshire will become the global production hub for the next generation five door Civic, supported by a new \u00a3200million investment. The ultra-sporty Honda Civic Concept car is presented at the New York International Auto Show, Wednesday . Although the dramatic Kermit green prototype seen in New York is a three-door version, the Swindon factory will be exporting the five-door hatchback version around the globe. A Honda spokesman said: \u2018With more focus on sporty, fun-to-drive dynamics the new U.S. Civic line-up will include Civic saloon, Coup\u00e9 and Si models, along with the return of the Civic five-door hatchback to the U.S. market. \u2018 . These will be followed by the launch of a next generation Civic Type R in the U.S. market, as the \u2018performance flagship\u2019 of the Civic line-up. Currently, just over half of the vehicles produced at Swindon are exported to the Continent. But when the factory moves to dedicated Civic production next year, about 50 per cent of production will be exported to key markets outside of Europe, including Japan and now the USA. The Swindon factory will be exporting the five-door hatchback version of the Honda Civic around the globe . John Mendel, senior vice president, automobile operations of American Honda Motor Co., introduce the ultra-sporty Civic Concept car . Currently, just over half of the vehicles produced at Swindon are exported to the Continent . Philip Crossman, managing director of Honda UK said: \u2019This is significant announcement demonstrates the opportunity available to the Swindon operation and reinforces the quality and reliability of the product coming from our UK facility.\u2019 Honda designer Guy Melville-Brown, a who worked on the new Civic\u2019s exterior styling said: \u2018This is the first time the Civic has been born in America. He promised the new Civic will have sporty proportions, with the windshield moved toward the rear, a shorter front overhang and longer rear overhang than the current Civic. The car will get new engines and transmissions, including a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder motor in higher-end models, Honda says. The sedan version will be in showrooms this fall, with a coupe and a high-performance R-Type coming later. Honda last rolled out an all-new Civic in 2011, and it was widely panned for bland styling, cabin noise and pedestrian handling. The Japanese car-maker was forced to quickly make improvements to the car at the end of 2012. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Robert Downey Jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a British journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie Downey was there to promote. The journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor's political beliefs and \"dark periods\" of addiction and jail time. Twitter, of course, is abuzz: Did journalist Krishnan Guru-Murthy go too far? Must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he'd like? From the start of the 7-minute television interview, it seems evident that Downey is not particularly interested in being there, even if being there was, ultimately, a benefit to him -- after all, he's promoting his latest film, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" He grows increasingly agitated, even as the line of questioning remains on-topic; his attitude, meanwhile, grew increasingly smug. His eyes glaze over as the reporter talks, he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he's much smarter than Guru-Murthy, and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say, \"Do I really have to sit here with this guy?\" At one point, he makes fun of Guru-Murthy for seeming nervous, saying, \"Your foot is starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question.\" But it's after Guru-Murthy asks Downey whether he thinks he is \"free from all of that,\" referring to Downey's history of \"taking drugs, drinking\" that the building tension comes to a head. \"I'm sorry,\" says Downey, \"What are we doing?\" To which Guru-Murthy replies, \"I'm just asking questions,\" which indeed was so. Downey has the right to refuse to answer the question, of course, but that's not what he does next. Instead, he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum: He smiles arrogantly, says \"bye!\" and stands up to leave. He sure showed him! It's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they're dating, what they're eating, where they vacation, what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago. Journalists often go too far, even if it's their job. And certainly not every journalist is good at his job. But while Downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past, questions that have been asked before, his business is our business. The entertainment industry is about entertaining people. As such, we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched. This is why most celebrities, especially those with a big budget movie to promote, agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general. But when the recognition no longer serves them? Then they want to bemoan it? What Downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions. That's what an interview is. He certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate, or even ones he simply doesn't feel like answering. But he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude, demeaning, and disrespectful -- even if he's a celebrity, and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off. What the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak. After he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves, the actor cannot resist a parting shot. He turns to the reporter, being sure to look directly at the camera on the way, and says, \"You seem okay. It's just getting a little Diane Sawyer in here,\" followed by what sounds like, \"and you're kind of a schmuck.\" Downey might not have been \"in the mood\" to be questioned... and those days, those moods, are understandable. We all have them. And yet in this case, that's, well, too bad. The actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job. He has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being. Given the terms, he is not entitled to call all the shots. That he thinks he can is perhaps our own, celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous; is it any surprise when they reveal that they, too, regard themselves as better than everyone else? But it's still on him.",

The football purists are foaming at the mouth \u2013 how can this Portuguese pretender dare to win games without wanting the football? Is this the most negative side to ever win the title? Is this the most terrible team to lift the Champions\u2019 crown? Woah there, just hang on a moment. Jose Mourinho has come under fire for Chelsea's lack of possession during their 1-0 win over Man United . Mourinho and his staff and players celebrate the crucial win over United on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . I\u2019m no fan of the kind of football Chelsea played on Saturday to beat Manchester United. But at the end of the season, they are getting the job done, it\u2019s as simple as that. And who can blame Mourinho for being so cautious? Last season they were seven points clear at the top of the table but fell away after losing at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace \u2013 both in the bottom half of the table at the time, and were beaten at home by Sunderland, who were six points adrift in 20th place. And then needing a win to go top of the Premier League with just two games to go, Mourinho watched his side draw 0-0 at home to Norwich, who were about to be relegated. The title that had been in their grasp, was lost. Chelsea\u2019s most impressive result during that run-in was a 2-0 win at Liverpool, a game made famous by Steven Gerrard\u2019s slip. It ended Liverpool\u2019s 16-match unbeaten run and checked their charge to the title. That day Chelsea let Liverpool have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes. Chelsea found a way to win without the ball. And Mourinho did the same on Saturday to an in-form Manchester United, who had 70 per cent possession at Stamford Bridge. It\u2019s not my kind of football \u2013 I like to see what talented professional players can do with the ball. And so does Louis van Gaal. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Steven Gerrard slips against Chelsea at Anfield last season - a game Chelsea won with only 17% possession . Ba scores as Chelsea go on to win at Anfield and effectively end Liverpool's title push last season . The Dutch master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit. All clubs have injuries, but for that massive game on Saturday, United needed key players in the team. It would have been fascinating to see if Van Gaal\u2019s possession philosophy would have won the day, over the Jose way. Chelsea won the game, and they did it in typical Mourinho fashion \u2013 by not wanting possession of the football. Jose has learned a lot from his mistakes of last season. I understand his pragmatism given that Chelsea are so close to sealing the title. But he fell into this negativity way too early in the season, and it led to their abject failure in Europe. Mourinho needs to be more expansive in the Champions League next season \u2013 that\u2019s for sure. Andre Schurrle\u2019s goal against Burnley after a sublime pass from Cesc Fabregas was a highlight of the season . But don\u2019t judge this Chelsea side on the Premier League run-in alone: they may not have been consistently sparkling with their style, but they have had some wonderful moments this season. On day one of the season Cesc Fabregas\u2019 sublime disguised pass for Andre Schurrle\u2019s goal at Burnley had us all out of our seats. It wasn\u2019t his only example of genius since August. When fit, Diego Costa\u2019s strength, movement and finishing have been a joy to watch. And then there\u2019s Eden Hazard. The player Mesut Ozil, Angel di Maria, Samir Nasri and Raheem Sterling and others all dream of being. Yes some of those others have medals, but they haven\u2019t shown the same amazing ability as the Chelsea number 10. His balance, his control, his passing and finishing have all been superb all season. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Manchester Untied's Wayne Rooney (right) Oscar (second left) scores against Swansea as Chelsea run riot at the Liberty Stadium in January . And during this period when Jose Mourinho is being over-cautious, making sure they secure the title they let slip last season, Hazard has lifted the team from a blue sea of negative mediocrity, to one capable of star quality. And back in January, Chelsea gave arguably the best footballing display of the season in the Premier League when they went to Swansea and won 5-0. The one-touch football was special, and the way the three behind Costa drifted around was reminiscent of the total football played by sides born out of Rinus Michels\u2019 Ajax and Holland sides of the 1970s. Chelsea were 4-0 in front at the break, by which time Willian had also hit the bar twice. Jose\u2019s side completely outplayed and outpassed one of the better footballing sides in the division. So don\u2019t be too harsh on Chelsea, on their way to the title it\u2019s hell to watch them right now. But Mourinho\u2019s men have taken us to heaven enough times this season to keep the critics off their backs.",

The comment was said while on a visit to Oklahoma City and is the first he's made about his wife's second presidential campaign, according to CNN. The former secretary of state and first lady kicked off her campaign, which was launched last week, in Iowa and will move on to New Hampshire on Monday. Bill Clinton made the comment in Oklahoma City on Sunday where he was speaking at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the car bombing that killed 168 people  at the Alfred P Murrah federal building in 1995 . In his first public comments on his wife's 2016 presidential bid, Bill Clinton, pictured here in 2004 with Hillary Clinton, said 'I'm proud of her' while on a visit to Oklahoma City . 'I'm proud of her,' Bill Clinton said of his wife to CNN reporter Ryan Nobles. Bill Clinton was in Oklahoma City to speak at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the car bombing that killed 168 people including 19 toddlers at the Alfred P Murrah federal building. He addressed hundreds of people gathered at the site of the federal building to commemorate the dead, hailing the city as an example to the world of a strong and compassionate community. The service for survivors, victims' families, and other citizens began at 9.02am with a 168-second moment of silence followed by a reading of the names of those killed. 'I mostly came here to thank you today,' Clinton said. 'For a whole country you burned away all the petty squabbles in which we engaged leaving only our basic humanity. 'I prepared for this day yesterday in New York by taking Hillary to see our daughter and son-in-law and my about to be seven-month-old grandchild. 'Hillary and I bathed her and fed her and put her to bed. I looked at her in that crib so I could remember how you felt, those of you who lost your loved ones.' Visibly emotional, he wiped his eyes as he drew parallels between the 'evil' behind the Oklahoma City bombing and the terrorism of Boko Haram in North Africa, ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and lone wolf militants in cities such as Paris. 'For 20 years you have honored the memories of your loved ones, you have inspired us with the power of your renewal, you have reminded us that we should all live by the Oklahoma Standard,' Clinton said at the service. Hillary Clinton will spend Monday and Tuesday in New Hampshire,\u00a0returning to the state that handed her a 2008 primary victory early in the bruising nomination struggle won by Obama. Clinton's supporters say her recent comments, particularly on inequality, do not reflect a shift in position. In her 2008 primary campaign, Clinton stressed the need to help families struggling economically and she criticized hedge fund investors, oil company profits, drug company subsidies and trade agreements. Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign last week. After spending three days in Iowa, she's off to New Hampshire for two days starting on Monday .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nEngland and Wales are facing a new World Cup threat after Australia performed a U-turn aimed at drafting Matt Giteau back into the Wallabies squad. The master playmaker has been an outstanding force for Toulon in the French club's back-to-back Heineken Cup triumphs and Top 14 title success last season. Now, four years after his Test career appeared to be over when he was left out for the last World Cup, the 32-year-old has discovered that he is eligible to play for the Wallabies again. Toulon fly half Matt Giteau (left) takes on Leinster centre Ian Madigan during the Champions Cup semi-final . Former Wallabies Drew Mitchell (left) and Giteau have been integral to Toulon's European dominance . Giteau has not featured for Australia since he missed out on selection for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand . Like England, Australia had a policy of not picking anyone who plays abroad. But Giteau's supreme form for Toulon led to a clamour for him to be recalled and on Wednesday the ARU announced a change which is seemingly tailor-made for the man once known as Kid Dynamite. With immediate effect, Australia will pick 'elite' players based abroad \u2014 providing they have 60 caps and seven years of professional service at home. At a stroke, the Wallabies have gained more experience and firepower for the World Cup, while their Pool A rivals England and Wales have extra cause for concern. Former England lock Nick Kennedy was a Toulon team-mate during the victorious 2012-13 European campaign and the London Irish academy director told Sportsmail: 'When I turned up at Toulon there were many excellent players, but the one guy who stood head and shoulders above the rest was Matt Giteau. AUSSIES WHO CAN PLAY . Matt Giteau (Toulon): Can operate at No 10 or centre. Has excelled in France and craves another shot. Drew Mitchell (Toulon): The 31-year-old former Reds and Waratahs wing has 30 tries in his 63 Test appearances. George Smith (Lyon): Openside with 111 caps was last picked by the Wallabies for 2013 decider against the Lions. ENGLAND STARS WHO CAN'T . Nick Abendanon (Clermont Auvergne): On shortlist for European Player of the Year award. Steffon Armitage (Toulon): Reigning European Player of the Year and having another superb campaign. Toby Flood (Toulouse): Usurped by Owen Farrell in the England team, the rise of George Ford has left him off the radar. 'I had watched him play for years but seeing him in training, seeing what he could do, was a shock. He is just so talented and is still one of the best players in the world. 'His ability is incredible, as is his decision-making. He's still got pace, his passing is so accurate and he's got a great kicking game. Defensively he gets stuck in, too. He's a great all-round player and, if anything, he has improved from spending time in France. He can do it all.' Giteau himself greeted the announcement from Down Under on Wednesday by tweeting: 'Massive news re policy change. The ultimate honour to represent your country, however form still must warrant selection.' That shouldn't be an issue. His Toulon team-mate, Drew Mitchell, is another Australian who could find himself back in World Cup contention but his initial reaction was to champion Giteau's claims. 'The fact he is not only playing in Europe but dominating it for a number of years \u2014 he not only would be able to handle Test rugby, he'd add a great deal of value in the World Cup squad,' said Mitchell . Ex-Toulon lock Nick Kennedy considers his former team-mate Giteau one the best players in the world . The ARU decision has been made in response to an exodus of leading lights to Europe. There are potential implications for the clubs who have recruited these players, who may now be called upon for Test duty rather than being able to commit themselves fully to their new employers throughout the season. That in turn may lead to renewed club v country tension, but not in the case of Harlequins, who have signed Australia lock and former captain James Horwill. 'It's not an issue for us,' said Conor O'Shea, Quins' director of rugby. 'We never want our players to turn their backs on playing for their country and there are windows for that. If the Wallabies wanted to pick James, that's great.' James Horwill (above) has recently signed for Harlequins but will still be eligible to play for the Wallabies . Australia's revised stance will lead to further calls for the RFU to relax their policy against picking players based abroad but Northampton's England flanker Tom Wood on Wednesday echoed comments by Tom Youngs of Leicester about the threat to squad unity and morale if the 'exceptional circumstances' clause is invoked to call up the likes of Steffon Armitage from Toulon. 'I am not against it in principle but I wouldn't like us to back-pedal on that now,' he said. 'It could have an effect on the team and undermine some of the togetherness we have built. 'If people start to lose faith and think there is an imbalance, then people aren't pulling in the same direction.' Tom Wood (right) believes Stuart Lancaster should still not select overseas players such as Steffon Armitage .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nKolo Toure has warned Raheem Sterling that leaving Liverpool could see him end up on the scrapheap at a big club, similar to the way that Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair did at Manchester City. Sterling stunned Liverpool earlier this week, giving an interview confirming that he has turned down a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract and admitting he is 'quite flattered' by interest from Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City are also keen on English football's hottest property. But Toure, who used to play for  City with Rodwell and Sinclair, has warned his Anfield team-mate a move to one of European football's heavyweights may not be everything he has dreamed of. Raheem Sterling has been warned about the dangers of leaving Liverpool by his team-mate Kolo Toure . Toure compared Sterling's situation with that of Jack Rodwell (left) and Scott Sinclair joining Manchester City . Toure (centre) says Liverpool is the best place for Sterling to stay and continue his development as a player . After starring in Everton's midfield and making his England debut, Jack Rodwell was being linked with every big club around. Sir Alex Ferguson was known to be an admirer but Rodwell was snapped up by Manchester City for \u00a312million. Repeated injury problems and the presence of Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Javi Garcia saw his appearances limited, while Fernandinho arrived for \u00a330m the next summer. After just seven league starts in two years, Rodwell moved on to relegation-threatened Sunderland for \u00a310m. It was a similar story for Scott Sinclair. After powering Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League and scoring eight times in the top flight, Chelsea youth product Sinclair moved to City for \u00a38m. But he too struggled with the competition in City's squad and moved to West Bromwich Albion on loan last season. He found it hard to break into the team there and returned to City before heading out on loan again to Aston Villa in January where he has found some form. Rodwell joined City in a \u00a312million deal in 2012, while Sinclair made the same move from Swansea City for an \u00a38m fee later that summer. The English pair made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances between them across two seasons at the Etihad Stadium. Rodwell joined relegation-threatened Sunderland last summer to end his City nightmare while Sinclair is trying to rebuild his career at Aston Villa. Toure says Sterling could be making a similar mistake by leaving Anfield. 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play,' Toure said. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he wouldn't be sure to start games. Make a mistake or don't score for two games and he will be on the bench. There is no messing at clubs like that.' Brendan Rodgers used his pre-match press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Arsenal to reiterate that Sterling was not for sale, and Toure sees Liverpool as the perfect place for the 20-year-old to continue his development. 'I'm not surprised there's speculation because everybody would want to have a player like him,' he told the Liverpool ECHO. 'But he needs to stay here. Liverpool is a great place for him. Sterling stunned Liverpool this week, giving an interview confirming that he had turned down a new deal . The likes of Chelsea, City and Arsenal would have big competition in their squads for a place . 'This is definitely the best place for him to continue his development. At Liverpool, he's beginning to be one of the most important players. He's playing every week. 'If he went to another club there would be big challenges he would face. He wouldn't be the most important player.' Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Chelsea had joined the race to sign England star Sterling, with the Premier League leaders wanting to be kept informed of any developments in his contract situation. Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also monitoring the developments in his stand-off at Anfield. Rodwell made just seven Premier League starts for City during his two-year spell before leaving the club . The former Everton man now plays for relegation-threatened Sunderland after a tough time at City . Sinclair's spell was even more difficult, he made just two league starts for City before moving out on loan . Sinclair is on loan at Aston Villa as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a young England talent . Doubts over Arsenal\u2019s ability to fund a move have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him with the likes of Chelsea and City. Liverpool boss Rodgers said on Thursday:\u00a0\u2018He\u2019s got two-and-a-half years to go on his deal and he\u2019s not going anywhere in the summer. 'I cannot speak for the owners but I have a good idea of what they would do. I know them well enough and for me it would not happen. Liverpool are one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear that money doesn\u2019t come into it. If the club doesn\u2019t want to sell, it won\u2019t sell, it\u2019s as simple as that. Money has never been the objective for the club. \u2018Whatever player - Raheem or anybody - it would always be on the terms of the club. \u2018He still has two-and-a- bit years left of his deal so it\u2019s not something we\u2019re overly concerned about. I\u2019m confident that at the end of the season we\u2019ll find the solution.\u2019 Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling is going nowhere this summer despite the speculation over his future . Sinclair spent more time on the bench than the pitch at City, and Toure thinks it could be similar for Sterling .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nBlackburn should brace themselves for interest in their players from top-flight clubs following their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, manager Gary Bowyer has said. Sky Bet Championship side Rovers were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night by Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, who booked a semi-final date at Wembley at the second time of asking thanks to Philippe Coutinho's angled 70th-minute finish in an Ewood Park replay. It ended a memorable FA Cup journey for Rovers that had included resounding home victories over Barclays Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke in previous rounds. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players . The manner in which they dispatched those two, coupled with the fact they frustrated Liverpool for the majority of the 180 minutes, is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending. Bowyer is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets, having rejected advances for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede in the past two transfer windows, and the Rovers boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months' time. 'What the players have done is they've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the Premier League,' he said. 'They've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the Premier League big boys. That's obviously the nature of the game that we're in, I'm not going to kid myself. 'It's the nature of business. If you look at all the clubs now, everybody sells. Liverpool sold (Luis) Suarez in the summer. 'You've seen over the two games against Liverpool and in previous games against Swansea and Stoke that we've got some very good young players. They're developing, they're growing and getting some real experience under their belts.' Blackburn strikers Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows . Blackburn's owners Venky's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings, telling Hull and Crystal Palace that Rhodes and Gestede would be remaining in east Lancashire. However, that position may have to soften if Rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the Financial Fair Play regulations. Their recent failure to do so caused the Football League to place them under a transfer embargo which Bowyer knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit. 'You always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it,' he added. 'We've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo. The embargo's just caught up with us because we haven't been able to bring enough bodies in.' Bowyer shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup replay . Indeed, Bowyer's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood in attack against Reading this Saturday. The stopper almost produced a moment for the FA Cup annals on Wednesday when, after coming up for a Tommy Spurr long throw, his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. 'We sent Easty up, more in hope than anything, we didn't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin,' Bowyer admitted. 'He's put himself forward for centre forward on Saturday!' Goalkeeper Simon Eastwood almost scored a late equaliser beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet .",

In spite of the defeat which prompted her predecessor's resignation, the SNP leader has racked up support across Scotland since, with some fans even hopeful of a victory on May 7. But weeks after having to deny allegations of back-room plotting against Ed Miliband, Mrs Sturgeon has been rocked by more smearing claims yet. For with just two weeks to go until she canvasses polling station queues, the 44-year-old has been accused of savage violence. The SNP leader (pictured right, aged 14) has denied her sister's claims she used to shave the heads off her sister's Barbie dolls . According to her sister, Gillian Owens, the politician was prone to hacking the hair of from dolls as a child. 'She once cut the hair off my Sindy doll, just for fun,' Gillian Owens, a part-time actress, said. Rebutting the claims, the politician told the BBC: 'I deny the allegations levelled at me by my sister. 'I'm sure I didn't cut the hair off her Barbie doll. 'But if I did it - and it's an \"if\" - then there would have been provocation involved, I'm sure of it.' Later posting on Twitter, she added: 'For the record I think my sister is misremembering. I'm sure it was a Sindy doll. #dollgate.' Poking fun at the tale, she told one follower: 'I'm not proud of it... but I've changed. My niece's have never come to any harm.' The accusations sparked a Twitter trend with internet users sharing mocking photographs of beheaded Barbie dolls on Saturday afternoon. The politician poked fun at her sister's claims which sparked a Twitter trend on Saturday afternoon . Twitter users were quick to join in on the joke, sharing photographs of beheaded dolls on the social network . One user shared this photograph of the SNP leader as a murderous doll herself, holding a pair of scissors . A joke Twitter account was set up in the name Barbie Sturgeon in the wake of the claims this weekend . In an interview with The Sun, Mrs Sturgeon's sister told of how they were 'like chalk and cheese' growing up. 'I was into dolls and everything girly. Nicola was into sitting reading. She was a very strong-minded wee girl.' Polls suggest the SNP is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern British politics, winning as many as 50 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Commons seats. That would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at Westminster for the first time. Mrs Sturgeon did not attend a ceremony at the Cenotaph this morning with other party leaders to commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli Landings. Laying a wreath a Scottish memorial site instead she later attended an SNP women's rally in Glasgow City Centre. The SNP leader skipped the Cenotaph ceremony to join female voters in central Glasgow at a women's rally .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nFirst impressions are not necessarily the best. When Adam Lyth scratched around for 22 in a Championship match against Nottinghamshire in 2008, Graeme Swann branded him a \u2018walking wicket\u2019. \u2018But then,\u2019 Swann added. \u2018He proved us all wrong.\u2019 Lyth, one of six Yorkshire players in the England squad that left Heathrow on Thursday for three Tests in the Caribbean, hit back in that match seven years ago with a second-innings of 132. Wisden later called him \u2018the find of the season\u2019. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth fields during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . Now he finds himself competing with Jonathan Trott to be Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner at the first Test in Antigua on April 13. It has been quite a rise. \u2018I was over the moon when I was told about my selection,\u2019 he told Sportsmail. \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get going.\u2019 The story of Lyth\u2019s ascent, from a talented but inconsistent left-hander to the ballast behind Yorkshire\u2019s charge to the Championship last season is one of grit, nous and no little skill. He finished with 1,489 runs \u2014 more than anyone in the country \u2014 six hundreds and a welter of awards. In fact, much of the hard work had been done before the season began, prompted by a moderate 2013 which forced him to work on his concentration levels. Yorkshire\u2019s sports psychologist Scott Hartley came up with the idea of harnessing Lyth\u2019s love of golf \u2014 his handicap is eight \u2014 to get him holing one short putt after another. The challenge lay not in the task itself, but in its repetition. \u2018There\u2019s no skill in sinking a two-foot putt,\u2019 said Lyth. \u2018It\u2019s just about concentration. It\u2019s a bit like batting and not giving your wicket away. You try not to do something silly.\u2019 After 213 successful putts, he missed. But the point had been made. Lyth set about 2014 with renewed focus. \u2018It wasn\u2019t just the concentration side of the game \u2014 my confidence changed, too,\u2019 he said. \u2018I got runs early on against the university sides, then played well at Taunton. It just snowballed from there.\u2019 Lyth plays a shot while batting for Yorkshire against the MCC at the\u00a0Sheik Zayed Stadium last month . At a time when England\u2019s Test batsmen have lost the knack of scoring the \u2018daddy hundreds\u2019 once espoused by former batting coach Graham Gooch, Lyth\u2019s remorselessness caught the selectors\u2019 eye. He made 230 at Northampton, putting on 375 for the first wicket with the highly rated Alex Lees, then 251 against Lancashire at Old Trafford, one short of Darren Lehmann\u2019s Roses record. \u2018One of my things is that I\u2019ve never got enough runs,\u2019 said Lyth. \u2018If you\u2019re going to get a hundred, you may as well make it a big one.\u2019 Lyth\u2019s dedication has been evident for years. His mum Christine would drive him from game to game in his teenage years, and he spent two seasons trialling as a midfielder with Manchester City before deciding to throw in his lot with cricket (his brother Ashley played for Leicester and Scarborough). And his reluctance to talk about his footballing days tells of a man who wants to be judged by his run-making alone. When he phoned his mum to tell her about his selection, she was \u2018very emotional\u2019. Lyth bowls during day three of the Champion County match against the MCC . As the home summer got under way with six university fixtures across the country, it was easy to forget that the first-class season actually began late last month in the Middle East. And, in the now annual fixture in Abu Dhabi between MCC and the champion county, Lyth made 113 and 46 not out as Yorkshire won by nine wickets. Watching on was Cook, who will have a big say in whether he walks out to bat in Antigua with Lyth or Trott, ready to play again after leaving the Ashes tour in November 2013 because of a stress-related condition. Lyth is suitably complimentary about a player with 49 Test caps to his name and an average pushing 47. \u2018He deserves his recall. He had a fantastic summer with Warwickshire and showed his class in South Africa with the Lions. \u2018It\u2019ll be very hard to keep the likes of him out of the side. I\u2019ve just got to concentrate on myself and impress in the nets.\u2019 The putting green may get a visit, too. Lyth is congratulated by team-mate Alex Lees (right) after taking the wicket of\u00a0Michael Carberry .",

The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to \u00a330,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as\u00a0The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down. It was replaced by The Bristol Brewery Georges, which has since closed and been converted into flats. As it is today (right) Many uses: There was a builder, undertaker and joiner stationed at\u00a0Broad Quay Bristol when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855 . How Broad Quay Bristol looks now. It has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat . Little difference: The view through St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works . High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 . St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now . Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was\u00a0destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940.\u00a0Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed . Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol.\u00a0The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s . Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again . Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone . Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol. It is believed the set of pictures could fetch up to \u00a330,000 when they go up for auction tomorrow . This photo shows Host Street in Bristol.

Auctioneers in the US have valued the gnome, which has some water damage, at about \u00a317,000. Dean Harmeyer, of Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection.' The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was \u00a33,000 - a whopping \u00a350,000 in today's money. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles,' Mr. Harmeyer explained. The Gnome has been valued at \u00a31,700 and was singed by all four members of the band after the shoot . On the shoot: Assistants organise the set for the artwork which cost \u00a33,000 - the equivalent of \u00a350,000 today . 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot. 'The gnome is in two parts - both front and back were created by Blake for the shoot, and presumably joined together, which may explain the small holes at the top and bottom of each. 'The Beatles have all signed the back in the lower, lighter portion in green marker. 'There appears to have been a liquid spill to on the back after the signing, which has affected the Ringo and John signatures. 'Both the front and back elements measure approximately 20 inches high by 5 inches wide. Both gnome elements are framed with a vintage, unopened stereo copy of the LP. Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by the band. The model has emerged for sale almost 50 years later .",

In 2009 the town unveiled a statue of Ball with a face so unlike the beloved comedian that locals have reacted with shock and horror. The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Scroll down for video . For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,\u201d he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' He added: 'I don\u2019t think this can be repaired. Take a look at the beautiful statues Nick at Nite created for \u2018Bewitched\u2019 and \u2018The Honeymooners\u2019 and Bob Newhart\u2026 it needs to be something more like those.' Artist Dave Poulin has declined comment. It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott\u00a0Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. Artist Dave Poulin has declined to comment on the controversy surrounding his work . 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.",

The BBC faced angry criticism last night for giving an Election platform to a \u2018mini Russell Brand\u2019 who has mocked David Cameron over his disabled son. Self-styled \u2018angry Leftie revolutionary and magician\u2019 Gareth Shoulder, from Liverpool, has been recruited by the BBC to comment on the Election as a member of its \u2018Generation 2015 Election youth panel\u2019. Shoulder, 24, who is a big fan of Brand and regularly messages the comedian on social media, used his \u2018@bbcgen2015\u2019 Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. After Mr Cameron spoke movingly in the first leaders TV Election debate about the NHS care given to Ivan, Shoulder sneered: \u2018A new record for Cameron\u2026 34 minutes before he pulls out the Ivan card and pretends he cares about our NHS.\u2019 Shoulder also said that, in the debate, the Prime Minister had \u2018really annoyed\u2019 him and made him want to tear politicians \u2018a new one\u2019 \u2013 a shorthand reference to an extremely offensive phrase. Following Thursday\u2019s TV Election debate, Shoulder then imagined the three female party leaders taking part \u2013 SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Leanne Woods and the Green Party\u2019s Natalie Bennett \u2013 to be the subjects of a lewd parlour game, tweeting: \u2018Bennett, Sturgeon, Woods. ****, marry, avoid.\u2019 He also called Chancellor Osborne a \u2018briefcase w****r\u2019. The BBC says it \u2018hand-picked\u2019 its 200-strong Generation 2015 youth panel to \u2018address fundamental questions about the relationship between UK young adults and democracy\u2019. The 24-year-old used his \u2018@bbcgen2015\u2019 Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy . Mr Cameron is pictured with his wife Samantha and children, Ivan, Nancy and Elwen, near his Oxfordshire home in 2009 . Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: \u2018It is disgraceful that the BBC should give a platform to someone to spew such Left-wing bile.\u2019 Mr Shoulder said: \u2018Speak to the BBC,\u2019 and refused to comment further.

Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. But when the imam arrived, the killer got into the rear seat of his Volkswagen Passat and shot him several times. The murder at 11.15am on Tuesday bears all the hallmarks of a professional assassination because the gunman was thought to have used a silencer and it took place away from CCTV cameras. Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers are investigating whether Mr Arwani, a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, was murdered on the orders of the regime. They suspect the part-time builder was tricked into driving to Wembley to quote for a job \u2013 but the killer was put off when the imam took his teenage son along and claimed he could not find the keys to the house. He is thought to have been executed when the mystery client \u2013 described as having an African accent \u2013 asked Mr Arwani to return a second time alone. Shortly after the shooting Mr Arwani's car was discovered 'perfectly parked' on the side of the road with the engine still running and with one of the windows wound down. The father-of-six from Acton, west London, had links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group outlawed in Syria and other countries in the Middle East. He is understood to have been a member of the organisation until about seven years ago, but retained ties to some of the group's senior figures. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. Above, two men stand outside the An Noor mosque in Acton, west London, which is near to where Mr Arwani was shot dead on Tuesday . Police cordoned off the murder scene. It is thought that when the imam arrived, the killer got into his Volkswagen Passat . Mr Arwani was\u00a0a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who is pictured above in September 2013 . Mr Arwani fled Syria in 1982 after a massacre in his home city of Hama carried out on the orders of Assad's father, Hafez. The imam, who moved to Britain in the mid-1990s after studying Islamic law in Jordan, claimed he was sentenced to death in his absence by the Syrian regime. He was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London three years ago. Police were forced to use riot shields to beat back protesters after they broke through barriers, and six people were arrested. Mr Arwani told reporters during the demonstration: 'This building belongs to the Syrian people, not a regime killing people every single day for ten months.' Detectives are also considering whether the father of six was killed by someone associated with the notorious An Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam from 2005 to 2011.",

A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\" Any additional funds raised will be \"paid forward\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.",

A Silicon Valley-based start-up is offering an at-home DNA saliva test to detect the same gene mutations priced at just $249 (\u00a3167).\u00a0It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 . It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, along with 17 other markers, all of which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Women with a mutation in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of up to 80 percent for developing breast cancer and up to a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer. The company behind the test, Color Genomics, was founded by Elad Gil, a former cancer researcher at MIT and Otman Laraki, a former engineer at Twitter and Google. 'We founded Color because we want to give every person the opportunity to understand their genetic risk of cancer,' said Dr Gil.

To get hold of the test, a physician will need to order it online, with the patient receiving a kit at home. The kit has instructions on how to take a sample of saliva and send it back to a central lab for processing. 'We want to make sure that there is always a physician involved,' the founders told Quartz. Color Genomics is currently available in 45 states and is hoping to comply with regulations required in New York, Maryland, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Florida. However, the test has received mixed responses with some saying it might not be useful, and could even be harmful. 'I worry it will give women information that we really don't know what it means - and that women will make very difficult choices that turn out to be incorrect,' Frances Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition told NPR. 'If we have more women who believe they are at increased risk,' Visco says, 'we will have more women removing healthy body parts. 'We really do not have enough information to base this kind of expansion of this kind of testing.' Color Genomics did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com for comment. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen . Just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease, a study has found. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer. Most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow, and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells. This means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. As part of the study, Swedish and British researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients, in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago. They found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen, and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day, had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all.",

But there is another form of the deadly gas, dubbed abiotic methane, that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor. Now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor . The reservoirs are secure, and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change. Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane, that can later be used as fuel. One reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge, in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'This ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the Arctic environment is ideal for this type of methane production,' said Joel Johnson associate professor at the University of New Hampshire. The Center for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Climate and Environment (Cage) estimates that up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of hydrates in the ocean floor. Scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\u00a0One such reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge (pictured), in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'But this estimate is not accounting for abiotic methane. So there is probably much more,' said Cage director J\u00fcrgen Mienert. Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. However, methane is also the principle component in natural gas.\u00a0It is a lucrative fuel source, which could contain more energy than all the world's oil, coal and gas put together. They believe the gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. 'Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor,' said Johnson. 'These only form in slow to ultraslow spreading seafloor crust. The optimal temperature range for serpentinisation of ocean crust is 200 \u2013 350 degrees Celsius.' Methane produced by serpentinisation can escape through cracks and faults, and end up at the ocean floor, causing a concern for future global warming. But in the Knipovich Ridge it is trapped as gas hydrate in the sediments. 'In other known settings the abiotic methane escapes into the ocean, where it potentially influences ocean chemistry,' says Johnson. 'But if the pressure is high enough, and the subsea floor temperature is cold enough, the gas gets trapped in a hydrate structure below the sea floor.' B\u00fcnz says that there are many places in the Arctic Ocean with a similar tectonic setting as the Knipovich ridge. Rather than causing a concern, the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long-term storage of methane carbon in deep-marine sediments. But other types of methane in the Arctic are causing a concern for scientists. Last year Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He tweeted: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane \u2013 which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Samples of the gas hydrates will provide more knowledge on abiotic methane. But they need to be drilled, as they are 140 metres under the ocean floor .",

After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week.

To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. \"I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,\" explained Jiang. The project started out to help \"fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,\" he said. \"The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection.\" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. \"My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle.\" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you: . 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

Brian Karl Brimager, 37, was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego, in connection with the death of Yvonne Lee Baldelli . The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Niguel, California, was last seen in September 2011 when she arrived in Panama with Brimager. Her family reported her missing the following January . The indictment alleges that Brimager murdered Baldelli, dismembered her body and disposed of her body parts in a remote jungle area. Brimager then engaged in an elaborate scheme to cover up the crime, including destroying evidence and sending a series of emails purportedly from Baldelli in order to make it appear to her friends and family that she was still alive, according to court papers. The indictment also alleges that Brimager attempted to conceal his crime by disposing of a bloody mattress involved in Badelli's murder in the ocean. Brimager conducted two Internet searches on Baldelli's computer, one for 'washing mattress' and a second for 'washing mattress blood stain,' according to documents. A man who was cutting bushes on the island province of Bocas del Toro found a bag containing Baldelli's remains in August 2013. Baldelli's family has the clothing designer was frequently out of touch so they did not immediately suspect anything was wrong. Panama police say Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States about 10 days after last being seen with Baldelli. In 2012\u00a0FBI agents and Panamanian forensic specialists found traces of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, which is the popular tourist spot where Baldelli was last seen.

But on Thursday night, to celebrate the fifth anniversary of her fight against childhood obesity, Michelle Obama once again busted some moves, this time on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. In a segment called The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2, the pair partnered up once again to show off some self-made maneuvers to a cover of I Like The Way You Move. It was a follow-up routine to a similar jaunt they did in 2013, in an attempt to inspire parents to get out and get moving with their kids. Lets disco:\u00a0Michelle Obama strutted her stuff on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night, in a follow-up routine to one they first did in 2013 . OMG: Called\u00a0The Evolution of Mom Dancing Part 2, the pair  pulled some embarrassing 'mom moves' Join in:\u00a0First Lady Michelle Obama and Jimmy Fallon took it to the dance floor again during her appearance on The Tonight Show on Thursday night . Oh no you didn't: At the end of the routine, Fallon pulled a goofy move he called the 'Barack Obama' Take this: But Michelle came back kicking, showing off an equally-awful jive called the 'Jimmy Fallon' In dancing up a storm, the two demonstrated some jives they called 'You Go Girl' and 'Oh My God, I Didn't Know You Were Coming Here!' But when Fallon pulled a silly move he called the 'Barack Obama', Michelle obviously hit back with a terrible take on Fallon himself. The Let's Move! Initiative encourages people to eat better, be more active and healthier. It was first launched in February 2010. During a sit-down with Fallon, Michelle spoke of what she's achieved in the last five years, and her love of music. 'I have an iPod,' she said. 'I usually just put my earphones in in the car. I\u2019m always listening to music. That\u2019s the way I kind of settle myself.' Initiative: Lets Move! is an anti-childhood obesity campaign that Michelle first launched in 2010 . However music isn't something she necessarily shares with her daughters,  Malia, 17, and Sasha, 14. 'Now I\u2019m at the stage where my kids are introducing me to music and they\u2019re like, ''You don\u2019t wanna hear this mom - the language is too bad'',' she said. 'Well, what are you doing listening to it?' On March 16, Michelle busted some similar moves with Ellen DeGeneres, dancing in a much more choreographed segment to Uptown Funk. Healthy eating: Michelle Obama told Jimmy Fallon that she gets her daughters to eat vegetables by having a 'no treat' rule in the house if they choose not to eat healthy . Give me broccoli!: Michelle Obama told Jimmy Fallon that the no treat rule worked and her daughters asked for her to give them the broccoli . The US First Lady revealed that she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to the same song on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll. This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children. Michelle said she has been practicing the dance, called Gimme Five!, for over a year. In addition to breaking it down on stage, Michelle Obama told Fallon how she gets her teenagers to eat healthy food. Obama said she has a 'no treat' \u00a0rule in her house if her daughters Sasha and Malia don't eat their vegetables. If the girls tell her their 'full' because they don't want \u00a0to eat the vegetables in front of them, there are no substitute meals if they become hungry later. 'After a couple of days of starvation, it\u2019s like, \u2018gimme the broccoli,\u2019 she joked . Fallon told FLOTUS that he too has a method of getting child to eat healthy but his method is a lot sneakier than hers. 'I\u2019m trying to sneak vegetables into anything, but there is a sneaky way to do it,' Fallon said of giving his two young daughters vegetables. 'I hide it in brownies,' he said.

The England international will be absent once again on Saturday at The Hawthorns, as he continues to be plagued by a hip problem and Rodgers admitted he is \u201cunsure\u201d as to whether Sturridge will play for Liverpool again this season. It has been a nightmare year for Liverpool in terms of goals. They had 88 after 32 matches last season but now, at the same stage, their total is 47 and not one of their players feature in the top 25 leading scorers in the Barclays Premier League. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is in danger of falling down the pecking order due to his poor injury record . Sturridge (left, pictured with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard) has played just 12 league games this season . England international Sturridge has been hampered by injuries during the course of the campaign . Sturridge has also endured a nightmare campaign. He missed five months due to calf and thigh issues and has struggled for consistency in the games he has managed to play. His length of time out has been extreme but history shows absences are not uncommon in his career. If Liverpool are to get back to where Rodgers wants them to be, they need goals. Divock Origi will arrive this summer, while they are trying to sign Danny Ings from Burnley and have registered a firm interest in PSV Eindhoven\u2019s Memphis Depay. But they are not going to be the peak of Liverpool\u2019s ambitions and Rodgers is searching for a proven attacker who will be able to call on consistently. When asked how many strikers he wanted to sign, Rodgers said: \u2018I\u2019m not sure but I need one that is going to be playing at a top level every week. It can make a huge difference. If you look at teams who are successful they have that \u2013 a consistent striker. \u2018What that gives the rest of team is crucial. You saw it here with Suarez, the impact that kind of striker can have. But it is something that is not easy to find. We have to find a way to attract them here. We will fight hard to do in the summer. We are on course to be 60 goals down on last year.\u2019 Sturridge picked up this latest injury on March 22 against Manchester United. England manager Roy Hodgson described it as \u201ca small tear\u201d after he was ruled out of games against Lithuania and Italy and it was a source of frustration to Liverpool that he missed last Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final. Liverpool boss Rodgers is keen on signing Burnley striker Danny Ings (left) and PSV's Memphis Depay (right) Belgium striker Divock Origi, pictured during his loan spell at Lille, will return to Liverpool in the summer . Rodgers was asked if he felt the stage had been reached where he no longer considers Sturridge to be his first choice striker and he said: \u2018Listen, that\u2019s entirely for you to write. He\u2019s not fit and once he can show that consistency and fitness, you can see in his performance level that it\u2019s a high one. \u2018But he has missed lot of the season, so we need to assess it. Either way if he\u2019 s not available, we need to have that support. There always is that risk with those type of players, with their speed and body type, but we have to hope with Daniel this year was just an unlucky season. \u2018We hope he can come back super-fit and super-strong because he has an immense talent. You can\u2019t argue with that \u2013 he can be as good as any striker in the world with his talent.\u2019",

One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette\u00a0reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher \u2013 you can\u2019t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.' It is not known at this time as to the nationality or the exact actions of the two passengers arrested . A spokesperson for Thomson Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by passengers on board flight TOM022 from London Gatwick Airport to Cancun, which diverted to Bermuda yesterday due to a customer incident on board. 'We operate a zero tolerance policy in relation to any disruptive behaviour. The passengers in question were removed from the aircraft and met by police. 'The flight departed within two hours to ensure the other customers could get away on their holiday as soon as possible. 'Customer safety is our priority at all times and we would like to reassure passengers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'",

The then Manchester United manager didn\u2019t mention in the same conversation that his son, Jason, stood to make a seven-figure sum in his role as an agent in the deal. No, Stam\u2019s representatives would discover that later. Raheem Sterling shakes hands with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . The two were at Melwood alongside the rest of the Liverpool squad in preparation for clash with Arsenal . Rodgers remains confident that Sterling will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer . Sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself, according to Roy Keane . But even so, it prompted Roy Keane to explain to me \u2013 for a column I was ghosting at the time - why a footballer should \u2018always look after No 1\u2019. United\u2019s captain scoffed at the idea that loyalty really existed in football. \u2018Jaap has discovered that, to football clubs, players are just expensive pieces of meat,\u2019 said Keane, without a hint of concern as to how his views might impact on his own relationship with his employers. Keane would probably feel Raheem Sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself. Sterling might be 20 and he might want what seems a ludicrous amount of money for a player, while hugely promising, remains relatively unproven. But he already has a young family to support and he has ambitions not just to win trophies but to make as much money as he possibly can. In truth, the only issue right now is how he is choosing to go about getting what he wants. He has an agent, in Aidy Ward, who is developing something of a reputation for an aggressive strategy for his clients \u2013 we saw as much when he turned up at Old Trafford last month with Saido Berahino \u2013 and the approach he is employing here is not exactly endearing Sterling to anyone. Sterling's agent Aidy Ward next to Saido Berahino (centre) at Old Trafford for Man United against Arsenal . Jaap Stam was a fixture of Manchester United's central defence from 1998-2001 before being sold to Lazio . Former Manchester United midfielder Keane insists that a footballer should 'always look after No 1' My guess is Liverpool wouldn\u2019t have been as upset by his appearance on the BBC as some might think. Sterling and Ward should probably realise that, right now, \u00a3100,000 a week is a generous offer. Just as they should realise that switching to a club like Manchester City might not be the smartest move at this stage of his development. Better to remain at Anfield where he will play regularly under Brendan Rodgers; a manager who hasn\u2019t exactly done a bad job of developing Sterling so far. On Friday, Rodgers said he remained confident that Sterling would stay; that the situation would resolve itself in the summer. But I wonder if it will when Ward and Sterling are employing such aggressive tactics and Liverpool have made clear their own approach to future contract negotiations with their players. For the top players Liverpool pay handsomely. Daniel Sturridge is believed to be earning around \u00a3150,000 a week and Steven Gerrard always felt well-enough rewarded for a player Ferguson once regarded as the \u2018most influential\u2019 in the Barclays Premier League. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge (right) is believed to be earning around \u00a3150,000 a week . Steven Gerrard trains at Melwood as he keeps fit during his period of suspension for Liverpool . But Liverpool do not have the financial muscle of a City or a Chelsea and that could yet result in them losing Sterling. Only recently Ian Ayre, the Liverpool chief executive, explained the club\u2019s strategy and a move towards more performance-related contracts. \u2018In any business you can make lots of money but if you let it go out of the door in other ways, then you are in trouble,\u2019 he said. \u2018The obvious biggest outgoing is players\u2019 wages and transfer fees. That\u2019s taken a pretty dramatic change in terms of how we look at it, analyse it and pay for it - and how we structure contracts. \u2018We pay good pay for our players; we pay fair pay. But we also like to give them the appetite to earn more which we know footballers like to do. As we all do. \u2018That\u2019s a far cry from deals where it is sort of nailed on and then it doesn\u2019t matter whether they perform or do not perform. \u2018So we are just trying to find a balance. I think other teams are doing that as well - or at least trying to do that. \u2018And it\u2019s certainly working for us - we have a happy bunch of players.\u2019 Sterling scored his first goal for England during their 4-0 win over Lithuania last Friday . The 20-year-old Liverpool forward uploaded this picture to Instagram from inside his home . Clearly, not everyone is happy. But that is not necessarily Liverpool\u2019s fault. They have a business to run and they have a duty to run it well. At the same time, Sterling will rightly feel he has a duty to his family to make as much money as he can during his relatively short career as a professional footballer. But he is not thinking it through carefully enough and nor, you suspect, is his agent. A footballer\u2019s image can have a huge financial value in modern football and right now Sterling\u2019s is taking a battering. And if he does move to another club and he fails to progress at the rate he currently is at Liverpool, he could find that has an impact on future earnings. Not that anyone he seems to be listening to will be telling him that.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nEngland may be well on course to sealing their spot at Euro 2016 but it appears as if manager Roy Hodgson still does not know his best XI. Sportsmail's\u00a0top team of reporters have submitted their starting line-ups for the finals in France, assuming everyone is fit of course. Let us know your England XIs by posting them in the comments section below. England manager Roy Hodgson pictured at the Juventus Stadium during Tuesday's friendly against Italy . MATT LAWTON . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Wilshere; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . Not perfect by any means but I think it\u2019s important to keep Rooney in a more central position, in the No 10 role he is most comfortable in, behind the best striker at this moment in time. Right now it\u2019s Kane but Sturridge and Welbeck certainly offer good alternatives. There\u2019s pace in that team as well. No natural holding player? I\u2019m not convinced Carrick is the way forward. Get the best players on the pitch. England captain Wayne Rooney (centre) looks to get a shot in at the Italian goal on Tuesday . IAN LADYMAN . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Wilshere; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Sturridge . England\u2019s defensive options remain their big problem so this is a team set up to score goals and win games by playing on the front foot. Luke Shaw hasn\u2019t done enough yet to displace Baines while Henderson and Wilshere represent a holding duo at the base of the midfield that should provide security bit also the ability to get the team moving forwards when appropriate. Rooney is picked in this team in a central role while Sturridge gets the nod ahead of young pretenders such as Harry Kane simply on the back of experience. This is the first game of a major tournament after all. Daniel Sturridge (left) charges forward with the ball during last September's friendly against Norway . ROB DRAPER . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jones, Gibbs; Carrick; Henderson, Wilshere; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck . No place for Daniel Sturridge at present and you might have to re-think if he's clear of injuries - but for the moment Rooney has to play up front. If England need a more attacking shape, Rooney can drop in and Sturridge come on for Wilshere or Henderson, but I'd be wary of starting that way, as England couldn't defend properly with two midfielders in Brazil. The back four doesn't convince but Jagielka and Baines struggled at the World Cup and Johnson is now out of the reckoning. England's Jordan Henderson in action against Italy at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday night . MATT BARLOW . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jones, Baines; Henderson, Carrick, Milner; Sterling; Rooney, Welbeck . Not far off the team Hodgson picked against Lithuania on Friday. It's as good as we get at the moment. Wish it was stronger at the back, where perhaps Smalling and Bertrand can apply pressure. No place for Wilshere in a three-man midfield. Need mileage and ball-winning abilities to offset the luxury of Carrick in as a playmaker. Rooney and Welbeck on the basis they have delivered in international football but much will depend on Kane's second season and the fitness of Sturridge. Gary Cahill (left) tackles Lithuania's Saulius Mikoliunas during last Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier . SAMI MOKBEL . Hart; Clyne; Cahill, Jones, Gibbs; Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . The two biggest calls here are Gibbs over Baines and Chamberlain instead of Wilshere. For me, the two selected will add more athleticism to the side without the loss of quality. There's certainly goals in this team, as well as pace. Europe beware! England left-back Kieran Gibbs (right) looks to run past Italian Alessandro Florenzi . JOE BERNSTEIN . Hart; Walker, Jones, Stones, Shaw; Carrick, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Young; Sturridge . It's ridiculous that Michael Carrick is only now getting the international recognition he deserves. He should have been a regular in the last two World Cups and will only be 34 at Euro 2016. With him and Rooney in the middle and lots of legs and energy around them, England should be able to play the quick and accurate tempo displayed by Liverpool in the last couple of years. Personally, I think that's the way to go rather than try and hit a big centre-forward like Harry Kane. Youngsters like John Stones and Luke Shaw will really emerge over the next 12 months. Michael Carrick (right) controls the ball as Roberto Soriano looks to make a challenge in Turin . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI . Hart; Clyne, Smalling, Cahill, Baines; Carrick, Wilshere; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . The big unknown is Harry Kane's progress and whether he will do it all again next season. It's perhaps harsh on Daniel Sturridge, who has proven his effectiveness over greater time, but how can anyone currently bet against Kane? The big weakness remains at centre-half - neither man truly looks the part at the international level but Smalling has improved this season. At 25 he needs to improve further still. If Sterling's ego can process being on the left, where he has shown himself to be more than capable, then this could be a delightful attack. England's Harry Kane (right) leaves Italy's Giorgio Chiellini face down on the pitch during the friendly . MIKE KEEGAN . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Carrick, Barkley; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck . Welbeck just gets the nod over Kane primarily for his pace and movement which is vital to England attacking at pace. If there is any chance John Terry can be lured back he walks in at the expense of Jagielka. Carrick must start and Barkley must cut down on giving the ball away in dangerous positions but offers more going forward than Fabian Delph. Baines gets one last chance to deliver on the international stage, ahead of Kieran Gibbs. Danny Welbeck (left) shoots during England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday .",

Obama said he 'had to say hi' to Bolt, the fastest sprinter of all time, when he became the first American President to visit the island since 1982. And when Obama met Bolt he could not resist joining the world-class sprinter in striking his trademark 'lightning pose'. Scroll down for video . When President Obama met Usain Bolt he could not resist joining the world-class sprinter in striking his pose . Before striking Bolt's signature pose, Obama praised him saying that 'nobody's ever been faster' During the encounter on Thursday, Obama spoke about the six-time Olympic champion saying 'Nobody's ever been faster than this guy. Ever...of all the billions of people.' He then told Bolt 'Wait, wait should we get a pose here? Come on man show me' before the pair busted out in the sprinter's signature pose for cameras. Bolt posted the video of him with Obama to his Instagram account on Friday and said that he was honored to have met the U.S. president. 'What can I say.. It was truly a great honour meeting the President of United States of America,' he wrote. Crowds across Jamaica cheered for President Obama on Thursday as he made multiple stops and became the first American president to visit the island nation since President Ronald Reagan in 1982. Bolt wrote on Instagram that it was 'truly a great honor' to meet the U.S. president . Obama asked the six-time Olympic champion to show him the pose before joining him in his signature pose . The world-class sprinter's lightning pose, which he strikes after winning a race, has become a trademark . While speaking at a town hall meeting with young leaders at the University of the West Indies in Kingston, he brought the audience to laughter when he gave a special mention to Bolt and triple-world champion, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. He said: 'I get a chance to say hi to Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. When you have the fastest people on the planet, you gotta say hi to them right?\u00a0Cause that's fast. 'There are a lot of people out there. And they're the fastest.'

Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller told Obama that he is well-loved in Jamaica . During his visit,\u00a0it seems no one was more excited, or starstruck, than Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller. 'I just want to say to you, you might not know, but you are very loved in this country,' Prime Minster Simpson Miller told President Obama. 'So I just wanted to say you're well-loved in Jamaica. Well, first of all I can say to you publicly, \"I love you.\"' Simpson Miller said she hoped Obama understood how important his visit is to Jamaica. 'It is a great pleasure to visit Jamaica, known for its beauty and the extraordinary spirit of its people,' Obama wrote as he signed the guest book at Jamaica House, where the prime minister and her staff have offices. 'May the deep and abiding friendships between our nations continue for generations to come.'",

But many current systems fail to solve the problem of how energy is managed and used overnight when the sun sets. Traditionally, energy gathered during the day is sent back to the grid, but this can prove costly if you need to buy it back - unless you have a smart battery that stores the excess energy in your home. Sonnenspeicher (pictured) uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harnessed by solar panels. This energy can be used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity back to the grid, homeowners can then use their stored supply for power . With this in mind, German firm Automatic Storage Device (ASD) and designer Wolfram Walter have created the Sonnenspeicher. It uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store the energy harvested during the day by solar panels fitted to a roof. This energy is used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity to the grid, and potentially having to buy it back at a later date or time, homeowners can use this stored supply to power their home until the sun rises again.

Prices start at\u00a0\u20ac8,450 (\u00a36,170).

For example, whenever there is energy in the battery available, the connection to the grid is locked. When this energy runs out, the Sonnenspeicher connects to the grid 'in a millisecond'. This switchover works the other way too. If a home is predominantly powered by the grid, the Sonnenspeicher will still store energy and instead act like a generator during a power cut. 'We wanted to create a storage system that makes you truly independent of the national power grid, that adequately supplies all of your household appliances at all times, and that remains efficient and trouble-free for at least 20 years, so that you can have the peace of mind that your investment really is worth every penny,' said the firm.

The third man's body was found after a five-hour search that involved aircraft and boats from several fire departments and sheriff's offices, as well as the US Coast Guard. He was smashed against rocks in a cove, which required rescuers to hoist his body up the cliff with a winch because they couldn't get to him by water. Local authorities say the abalone season, which started April 1, is always marred by several rescues and often a few death. Abalone, a snail-like mollusk with a beautiful shiny shell, sells for up to $70 a pound.",

Both Democrats are toying with a presidential run, both are facing long odds in that endeavor, and both shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night. But, as was evident at the dinner, that is where the similarities end. O'Malley is a former mayor and Maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand. Webb, on the contrary, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Virginia who comes across as more stoic and, at times, uncomfortable with retail politics. Before the event, O'Malley confidently cruised the union hall. He took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances. \"It is a marathon, not a sprint,\" one man told O'Malley, a nod to his long odds in the 2016 Democratic nomination process. \"Yes, it is; it's a marathon,\" O'Malley responded. \"Welcome to Iowa,\" said another man. \"We hope to see you here more.\" O'Malley smiled, \"Thanks a lot. I hope you do, too.\" Webb wasn't nearly as active, opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him. As Webb cut into his sizable helping of pork, O'Malley was standing directly behind him, shaking hands. The former Virginia senator, after possibly seeing O'Malley making the rounds, did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard Democratic activists in the room. \"Seven months old,\" Zach Smith, a new father, said of his baby boy, Noah. \"I have a bunch of kids. The youngest one is 8 years old,\" Webb said. The baby looked up at the senator. \"He is pretty calm,\" Webb remarked, himself calm. Despite coming from bordering states, Webb and O'Malley don't know each other. When they passed each other in a Des Moines hotel lobby on Friday morning, it was the first time the two had met. That said, the two Democrats find themselves in the same position. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid Sunday, leads every national and state poll of the Democratic field. She has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination. O'Malley and Webb are both looking up at her. In a March CNN/ORC poll (PDF) of national Democrats, only 1% said O'Malley and Webb were their top choice. In a January poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register (PDF), O'Malley was at 1% among Iowa Democrats, while Webb found himself at 3%. The speaking portion of the night further showed Webb and O'Malley's differences. Webb, who spoke before the governor, gave a more subdued, biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president: Basic governance, economic justice and criminal justice reform. To the approval of the audience, Webb promised to come back to Iowa regularly. \"I am committing to you right now,\" he said, \"we are going to go over the whole state.\" And the biggest applause came near the end of his speech, when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues. \"Money is ruining our political process,\" Webb said to a chorus of applause and \"hear hear.\" O'Malley, on the other hand, gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines. At points, the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands. \"When the American Dream is denied, our lives shrink, our hopes fade, and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear,\" O'Malley said, delivering the same stump speech he usually gives. \"To make the dream true again, we must fight for better wages for all workers, so that Americans can support their families on what they earn.\" As the event wound down, Webb and O'Malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people. O'Malley, who spent the previous day in Iowa, left Friday night for New York. Webb, who is in the midst of a four-day trip to Iowa, stayed in Des Moines and headlined a veterans event on Saturday morning in Waterloo. Webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event. He told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans. He also touted his work on passing the 21st Century G.I. Bill of Rights, a 2008 act that expanded education benefits for veterans, and stressed that more needed to be done. \"You want the next greatest generation, give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had,\" Webb said to applause. \"If you really want to thank them, hire a vet.\" After the event, Webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny Saturday morning. Asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, Webb smiled. Skepticism of retail politics is not new for Webb. As a one-term Democratic senator, Webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning, namely fundraising and retail politics. This time, he put on a rosy view. \"This is the good part of it, \"Webb said, with a laugh. \"Talking to the media, that is not always the good part.\"",

City earned maximum points from seven games prior to throwing away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at home to the Clarets on December 28. With Burnley battling for survival, the Gunners will be wary of a similarly damaging result when they take on Sean Dyche's spirited team in front of the Sky Sports cameras. But if they do manage to take three points from Turf Moor, Arsenal will still be on target to match their best ever winning streak in the Premier League era by the time the season is over. The Gunners hold the record for the most consecutive wins, having come out on top in 14 successive games between February and August in 2002. That run, which was also overseen by Wenger, helped Arsenal beat Liverpool and Manchester United to the 2001-02 title before a draw at West Ham in the second game of the following season ended the streak. United sit second on the list, having put together a 12-game winning run under Sir Alex Ferguson between March and August 2000. Their storming end to the 1999-00 campaign ensured the Red Devils comfortably won their sixth Premier League title, with second-placed Arsenal finishing a massive 18 points behind them. Chelsea's longest winning streak stands at 11 games between April and September in 2009 as interim boss Guus Hiddink and his successor, Carlo Ancelotti, helped the Blues hit top form. Liverpool put together their best run of form last season as they stormed towards their first Premier League title before faltering in two of their final three games. Aided by the goals of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, Brendan Rodgers' side also managed 11 straight wins between February and April before losing 2-0 at home to Chelsea. Manchester City were just one victory away from equalling their best run of eight straight wins earlier this season but they couldn't quite manage to repeat the feat they managed between December 2013 and January 2014. The Gunners hold the record for the most consecutive victories - winning 14 games to clinch the title in 2002 . Manchester United's winning streak of 12 games helped Sir Alex Ferguson's men to the title in 1999-00 . Chelsea striker Demba Ba slides the ball home at Anfield to end Liverpool's 11-game winning run last season . Everton also put together their best ever run in the Premier League last season, earning seven wins on the bounce between March and April last year as they tried and failed to break into the top four. Newcastle won seven straight games in 1996, while Tottenham managed one less in the last three months of 2011. Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Southampton, Sunderland and West Ham all have a best winning run of five games in the Premier League era, with Hull, Leicester, Stoke, Swansea and West Brom all managing four victories in succession. Struggling QPR could do with repeating the three-match winning steak they put together in March 1995, while Burnley's two consecutive victories last November remains their most impressive run.",

The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe. 'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said. China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build . 'It's a very difficult system to make operational.' A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher. Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University. The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write. Pictured on the left is a test model Maglev train from 2003. \u00a0Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track.

The Channel 4 programme, hosted by actor Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead, celebrates the duo's love affair with classic cars. And each episode looks at the history of various types of vehicles, as the pair give old-bangers a new lease of life by restoring them to their former glory. Actor Philip Glenister and car designer Ant Anstead return to present a new series of For The Love of Cars . A teaser from the first episode shows Glenister \u2013 perhaps most recognisable behind the wheel of a red Audi Quattro while playing Gene Hunt in Ashes to Ashes \u2013 test driving an Aston Martin Vantage. Revving the engine before taking off at speed around a winding country road, Glenister appears to wipe the colour from Anstead's face before stating: 'This is Bond.' The second series also sees the pair broaden their horizon by working on a number of foreign-manufactured cars as opposed to just primarily British ones. Additionally, they work on more than one vehicle per episode and complete stalled restoration projects, instead of just finding dilapidated cars to fix. The finished products are then auctioned off at the end of every programme, and Anstead admits that the quality of the restorations make it hard for the owners to let go. He said: \u2018You have to remember, these cars have a special place in the hearts of these people, for various different reasons. Glenister and Anstead speed around a bend as they test drive a classic Aston Martin Vantage . \u2018For somebody to let go of something that important to them is hard enough, but when they see the results at the end of the restoration, it\u2019s really tough. \u2018These are jobs that they\u2019ve not been able to finish themselves.\u2019 The cars featured in the series include a quintessentially British Aston Martin DBS, which was brought back to life after been recovered from a barn in Oxfordshire. For The Love of Cars series two is branching out beyond just British vehicle makeovers . And a Rover SD1 police car \u2013 the classic panda car of the early 1980s \u2013 which features in a  race conducted by the show\u2019s presenters, to find out what side of the law had a speed advantage. The pair also restore two of the most iconic cars to ever come out of Europe \u2013 a run-down Fiat 500 and a VW Beetle. The first episode of For the Love of Cars will broadcast on Channel 4 on Sunday, April 19 at 8pm.",

Arsenal came out on top globally with 5.68million followers ahead of Chelsea (5.49m) and Manchester United (4.87m). But one country was missing: China \u2013 where the government outlaws Twitter as they seek to keep control of information and the media. Manchester United have over eight million followers on Weibo, almost double that of Twitter . Manchester City also have over eight million Weibo followers compared to 2.4million on Twitter . Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao are third on the list of clubs in the world with most Weibo followers . In Twitter\u2019s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans \u2013 just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000. Barcelona have 5.4million followers on Weibo, the fourth most of any club in the world . Arsenal have 3.6million followers on Weibo compared to 5.6 million on Twitter . United\u2019s support in China is no surprise as they have solid support across Asia on Twitter, but City punch well above their weight in China compared with the rest of the continent. Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter \u2013 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton\u2019s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez\u2019s side. Of the 10 Premier League clubs active on Weibo, six \u2013 United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham, feature in the top 20 most followed clubs in China. The Manchester clubs are first and second, with Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao \u2013 managed by Fabio Cannavaro \u2013 third and Barcelona fourth. Chelsea are 11th on the list of clubs with most followers on the Chinese microblogging site . Liverpool have 2.3million followers on Chinese site Weibo compared to 4.2million on Twitter . Bayern Munich are 13th, Real Madrid are way down in 18th \u2013 with 81,303 less followers than Tottenham \u2013 and Paris Saint Germain in 20th. And such is the popularity of the Premier League, Michael Owen has a staggering 3,074,148 followers on the site - which would put him 10th in the top 20 clubs list. With the popularity of football rapidly increasingly in China \u2013 in December 2014 the China\u2019s President made football compulsory for children and added it to the national curriculum \u2013 expect Premier League clubs to intensify their effort to grab a slice of this lucrative market. SportQuake provided the data and their founder Matt House said: 'With its thrilling brand of football, the Premier League delivers mass engagement for fans in markets all over the world. We can say with confidence that more Premier League teams will be active on Weibo next season. 'As always, football and the Premier League is leading the way with new technologies, but we expect follower figures on both Twitter and Weibo to balance out to reflect fan bases as the platforms mature.'",

Alison, 43, from Gloucestershire, has since had to go under the knife a further 12 times but is still living with the damage that ensued following a breast augmentation operation six years ago. 'It's horrible to look at and horrible to live with,' says Alison, who admits she would do 'anything' to look normal again. Badly damaged: Alison was left with a breast that resembled a croissant following an infection . Desperate to improve the look of her breasts, the retail worker has now had a 13th operation on her breasts, this time as part of TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters. Speaking on the show, surgeon Vik Vijh, a cosmetic doctor who specialises in correcting botch jobs, said he was shocked by the appalling damage. 'When I first saw Alison I thought she looked mutilated,' he said. 'She had an imploded breast, it looked like a croissant.' More surgery, he said, was the only way to fix it but warned more than one operation could be needed. Alison's problems began as a teenager when, embarrassed by her small breasts, she began using a booster bra. Horrible: Alison, who wants to 'feel normal again', has consulted plastic surgeon Vik Vijh . Hopes: Alison had hoped to boost her bust but ended up loathing her body (picture posed by model) 'I was always conscious of the way I looked, I bought a booster bra so I could look bigger,' she remembers. But when she decided to fix the problem by going under the knife in a bid to increase her cup size to a DD, it proved to be the worst decision of her life. Initially pleased with the results, she noticed shortly after the operation that one implant was going hard. 'It started to go hard so I went back and got another implant inserted but that got an infection,' she said. Bacteria attacked her breast tissue causing it to die so she was left with one shrivelled, deformed breast and one enlarged by surgery. Relief: Following 13 different operations to fix the damage, Alison now has the normal breasts she hoped for . Now she says she would do anything to feel like a normal woman again. 'I hate the way I look and want to be fixed in some way,' she adds. Mr Vijh, who had initially thought she would need several operations, used fat cells from her stomach combined with an implant to fix the damage. Although a course of antibiotics was needed to keep a repeat of the infection at bay, Alison says she is delighted with her new-look breasts. 'I feel fantastic and feminine,' she says. 'I can wear anything now. My partner gets flashed on a daily basis and I have a smile back on my face.'",

Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck . Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot . 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire's\u00a0Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees and a babbling brook outside their door. Ingenuity: The couple started with a steel frame and slowly, project by project, built a home in about a year and a half . Gorgeous: Hannah and Alex now have a gorgeous, wood-lined home in a lot surrounded by trees and a babbling brook . Details: The couple has a wood-fired stove to keep out the cold, stained glass windows and other creature comforts . They're nearly self-sufficient, too. The home is powered mostly by solar panels. Alex said their first power bill was just $25. The stove and hot water are gas-powered and water comes from a nearby spring. 'I didn't want to live inside a plastic box,' Alex said. 'Not because I'm a hippie but because it feels nicer and is just a nicer place to be.' All told, the project cost Hannah and Alex about $25,000. And the couple even plans to build another one like one day. 'It's really, really nice,' Hannah said. 'We love it.' Two bedrooms: The home has a bedroom for the couple as well as a loft that doubles as a spare room where the cat sleeps . Green: Water comes from a nearby spring and most of the electricity comes from solar panels .",

A second person has been charged over a doorstep acid attack on a property developer that left him scarred for life and suffering a loss of vision. Property developer Andreas Christopheros, 29, was left fighting for his life when corrosive liquid was thrown in his face outside his home in Truro, Cornwall. Nicole Phillips, 45, from Hastings in East Sussex, has been charged with perverting the course of justice and is due to appear at Bodmin Magistrates Court on April 30. Her husband David Phillips, 48, had already been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent. Appearing at Truro Crown Court on Monday he pleaded not guilty to the charge, and was remanded in custody before his trial on June 8. Mr Christopheros, a father-of-one, was left with life-changing injuries, including a loss of vision and facial scars after the alleged attack last December. A businessman in the event and property management industries, he used to organise the Run To The Sun event, an annual custom car and dance festival\u00a0which attracts around 100,000 car fans to Newquay every summer. He is thought to have worked on BBC Radio One Roadshows. The privately-educated businessman, who attended King's College in Taunton, Somerset, before graduating from Plymouth University, also used to run a holiday park in Newquay. Mr Christopheros is also a director of Chase 3000, a car rally across Europe planned for 2015, and owns several properties around Newquay. Mr Christopheros' property  in Truro (pictured) was cordoned off after he was attacked outside it in December .

Sheila Secker, 78, had been given the pay-as-you-go phone by her son, but as she had not used the phone for some time it had been cut off. When the grandmother collapsed in her home in December, she could not contact her family and died in hospital a few days later, the Sunday Times reports. Cancelled: As Sheila Secker had not used her pay-as-you-go phone for any chargeable services, Vodafone retired her number without warning . Mrs Secker's son Steve told the newspaper how his mother had owned the mobile phone for 14 years, and recently topped up the credit, but had not made any calls. Shortly before her fall, Mrs Secker moved into a new home, near York, and had yet to have a landline installed, so relied on her mobile. Mr Secker told the Sunday Times' Money section how the family raised the alarm the next day after not hearing from his mother, and emergency services were called. Mrs Secker died in hospital on New Year's Day. When Mr Secker contacted Vodafone he was told his mother's number had been retired, and that a 'glitch' in the system had allowed the elderly woman to continue to 'top up' her credit. Take heed: Most major mobile phone operators regularly 'recycle' numbers when they have been out of use for a three to six months . 'What I cannot fathom is, if Vodafone has retired a number, how can it permit money to be taken as a top-up,' Mr Secker, 46, told the Sunday Times. 'This is nothing more than a rip-off to add insult to injury'. Most major phone operators regularly 'recycle' phone numbers when they have been out of use for a certain time. A Vodafone pay-as-you-go mobile is put into 'semi-quarantine' if no chargeable calls or texts are made for 90 days. After a\u00a0further\u00a090 days the number is disconnected, and 270 days later the number is recycled and given to another customer, with any credit on the phone lost. EE retires a pay-as-you-go number after 180 days of inactivity and O2 disconnects a pay-as-you-go phone after six months of no chargeable services. Tesco Mobile allows six months of inactivity before sending the customer a text to remind them to use their phone again, or their number will be lost.",

With its large snout and blackened eyes, the furious-looking beast appeared to breath fire as it stared down from the sky in the bizarre cloud formation. Captured at dusk the red sky adds a fiery hue behind the clouded creature giving it an uncanny likeness to the legend of the fire breathing dragon slain by St George - ahead of the patron Saint of England's day tomorrow. The cloud dragon appears to breathe fire in these incredible images captured by amateur photographer Nicolas Locatelli . Amateur photographer Nicolas Locatelli, 20, snapped the unusual cloud in the sky above Briones Regional Park, in California\u00a0on a Nikon D7100. The student, from San Francisco said he didn't even notice the striking formation until he checked his camera when he got home. The image went viral on Reddit after his friends suggested he upload it to the social network. He only noticed that the red sky at dawn appeared to give a fiery hue behind the cloud formation after he got home and checked the pictures . The pictures, which create an uncanny likeness to the fire breathing dragon slain by St George, the patron Saint of England, were captured at dusk above Briones Regional Park, in California . Nicolas said: 'When I saw the image I was pretty intrigued. 'The way the sunset lit up the cloud at the mouth of the dragon made it look like flames were coming out of its mouth. 'The image was timed perfectly too. The image was taken with a zoom lens on a stormy day so the clouds were in the distance and moving quickly so I got really lucky taking this picture. 'The image was received very positively on Reddit. 'When my friends saw the image, I asked, 'what do you see in this picture?' and they said 'definitely a dragon breathing fire' and 'it's the dragon slain by St George.' 'I got a lot of positive and jovial feedback on the image.' A picture of the legend of St George and the Dragon . The medieval legend of St George and the dragon is over a thousand years old. St George travelled to Libya, where he met an old hermit who told him a dragon had long ravaged the country, demanding the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden every day. With the population of young girls decimated, the king's daughter alone remained to be sacrificed, unless a knight could slay the dragon. Determined to save the princess, he set out to slay the dragon, luring it from its cave upon his arrival. But after falling from his horse, St George evaded the dragon's attack by hiding under an enchanted orange tree before recovering his strength and killing the beast with his sword. The slaying of the dragon by St George, a brave Roman soldier who protested against the Romans' torture of Christians, was first credited to him in the twelfth century, long after his death. The real St George was thought to be a Roman soldier,\u00a0born to Christian parents in A.D. 270 in what is now Eastern Turkey. Adomn\u00e1n, the Abbot of Iona in Scotland, provides Britain\u2019s earliest recorded reference to Saint George in the 7th Century. He details the story of the Saint\u2019s exploits, which had been told to him by a French bishop named Arcuif who had travelled to Jerusalem with the crusaders . As the Crusaders returned to England from foreign shores, they brought with them tales of St George, and his reputation grew . A church in Fordington, Dorset, still records St George leading the Crusaders into battle. St George later resigned his military post and protested against Emperor Diocletian against his persecution of Christians . He was dragged through the streets and executed on April 23, 303 AD. Almost a millenia later in 1222 the Council of Oxford declared April 23rd to be St George\u2019s Day . It was not until 1348 that St George became the Patron Saint of England. Today April 23 is celebrated as a day of patriotism for England.",

The number of Australians visiting Bali over the past two months was up 16.7 per cent from the same period last year, with more arriving than any other nationality. Indonesia Institute president Ross Taylor says it is unfortunate the fate of Bali Nine drug smugglers is probably third on the list of concerns about Indonesia among fellow nationals. A proposed ban on alcohol in Indonesia could deter Australians from holidaying in Bali . An Indonesia expert says Australian tourists are more worried about a proposed booze ban there than the execution of the Bali Nine pair, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) Mr Taylor says legislation proposed by two Islamic parties banning consumption of all beverages containing more than one per cent alcohol is considered more of a worry, and could become law as early as the end of this year if backed by President Joko Widodo. Also of concern is a review of foreign property ownership. Mr Taylor said mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban, which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism, such as five-star hotels. He said the proposal had 'horrified' authorities in Bali. Mini marts would be the initial focus of the alcohol ban, which would be broadened but not apply to certain locations to protect tourism, such as five-star hotels . 'My own view would be that common sense would prevail... but I'd be cautious in saying that because there are some of the more pronounced religious groups throughout Indonesia really gaining momentum now,' Mr Taylor told AAP. 'In Aceh, they've introduced Sharia law. Very strictly. Even foreigners can be arrested in Aceh for not dressing appropriately.' Mr Taylor said nationalist sentiment was running high, with Indonesian authorities reviewing every property to ascertain whether it was being held on behalf of a foreigner. 'A lot of them are,' he said. 'The state will either resume that property or offer the nominee the option of just keeping it for themselves, with no legal comeback from the foreign owner. 'So if you take that and the alcohol thing I think it's really symptomatic of a disturbing trend - and Indonesia is a country that stole my heart so I'm not anti-Indonesia - of the Jokowi government showing all the signs of being naive, dysfunctional and lost at the moment.

The British-led war games are code named Joint Warrior and the numbers are all big: 13,000 personnel from 14 countries operating more than 50 ships and submarines as well as 70 aircraft. NATO says the planning started long before Russia began behaving as an adversary. For more than a year NATO has been condemning Russia's actions in Ukraine as well as its frequent, large scale, snap military drills and those long-range Bear bombers repeatedly flying very close to NATO airspace. So, if Joint Warrior is not a deliberate response, it's certainly a timely one. CNN was invited to spend a day aboard one of the vessels taking part -- the U.S. Navy's guided missile cruiser USS Vicksburg. It's the current flag ship of a standing NATO maritime group. Commanding officer Rear Adm. Brad Williamson says Russia's behavior is an added motivation to do well in these exercises. \"Anytime you have a security situation that reminds us it's not just a game we're doing out here, that there are real world implications to our ability to provide security to alliance members, I think that focuses our minds on what we're doing,\" Williamson says. Other personnel on the Vicksburg tell us competition between different nations and even individual ships and subs is also a big motivator. The details of these war games are top secret. But they're broken into two parts: The set training exercises that involve vessels or groups completing specific jobs and what they call \"free play\". That's where everyone's divided into two teams with different orders and motivations manipulated by the game masters. Tensions rise and it's likely pretend war follows. Easy to see how things get competitive. Russia has taken an interest. It used its right under what's known as the Vienna document to send its own inspectors. NATO says they only stayed a few days and didn't see anything sensitive.",

Mohammed Dahbi discriminated against actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer after ordering them to 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He warned that if they ignored his request during the trip on September 18, 2011, he would throw them out. Outraged: Mohammed Dahbi was accused of discrimination after ordering actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer to stop kissing and 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He was ordered to pay the couple $10,000 in fines . When they got out, Dahbi also called the pair 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away. He claimed during the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings\u00a0they were 'touching each other all over' and 'kissing heavily' . But according to DNAinfo New York, Judge John Spooner disagreed and ordered him to pay the fine. He also made him attend anti-discrimination training and pay a $5,000 civil penalty to the city. Ms Spitzer told the news website: 'We felt that what happened to us was wrong and he needed to take responsibility for his actions. The trip began at Columbus Circle when Ms Spizter climbed into the yellow cab with her dog and headed to pick Ms Thronton up in Chelsea, before heading to Sunset Park in Brooklyn. However, when they hit the Meatpacking District, Dahbi turned around and barked the orders at them. Verbal abuse: When the pair (pictured) got out, Dahbi also called them 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away . They said he was discriminating against them because they were gay, to which he replied: 'Don't make me out to be an a**hole.' They insist it was just a peck on the lips. Spizter told DNAinfo she knew this because she had just been to the dentist. She said: 'That\u2019s why I\u2019m so aware of what my behavior was in the taxi.' Dahbi's lawyer, Ali Najmi said he had never mentioned anything about the pair's sexuality and has a 'standard of decency'. They are now planning to appeal the decision. In a statement on his firm's website, he said: 'We will be pursuing an appeal of this decision. The Administrative Judge acted unreasonably and made conclusions of fact that cannot be substantiated based on the record. The fine amount is completely unfair given that there was no real injury here.'",

In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. \"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,\" he said. \"It makes for the best cosmetic outcome.\" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. \"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',\" Dr. Green said. \"Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw.\" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. \"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'\" he said. \"If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. \"It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. \"You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!\" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. \"What's really fun is seeing it heal,\" he said. \"Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring.\" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. \"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,\" the company says. At \u20ac99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at \u20ac712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. \"If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,\" he said. \"It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.\"",

But they do leave their trash. Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. \"Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,\" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. \"We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,\" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. \"There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip.\" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing \"in an eco-sensitive manner,\" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.",

Install a ceiling fan. The ideal temperature for sleep is 18-21C. 2. Open a window just a crack to let air circulate. 3. Add blinds and thick, dark curtains to keep the light out. 4. Plush rugs and cushions muffle noise. 5. Create symmetry matching pairs. 6. Add plants, art or photos of nature and natural materials. 7. Eliminate clutter by investing in cabinets, drawers and storage. 8. Ditch the TV. Fill your space with something beautiful. We spend nearly a third of our lives sleeping. Yet many people don't realise just how sensitive our bodies are during these vital hours of rest. The space we sleep in has a huge effect on the quantity and quality of our sleep - and therefore the quality of our waking lives. After all, when we're not properly rested, our brainpower, digestion, reflexes and much more suffers. Better interior design really can help you get a better night's sleep. SLEEP EXPERTS SAY... LIGHTING THE PATH TO REST . Our bodies have evolved to respond to ambient light. Warm hued rays from the setting sun signal that it's time to sleep, while blue daylight releases hormones to make us alert. Now that we live much of our lives under artificial light, we must mirror these natural light spectrums to keep our circadian rhythms in harmony. According to the infographic, try shutting off computers, TVs and smartphones before going to bed. Make sure your bedroom is in complete darkness, and us low-wattage bulbs after sundown. Avoid blue lights and use lamps with warm yellow, gold or reddish light. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COLOUR . Just as bright red signals danger in nature, all colours have an impact on our psychology. So paint and decorate your bedroom in soothing hues for better sleep and deeper relaxation. Blues, greens and greys are said to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, and promote better sleep. But reds, yellows and oranges increase heart rate and blood pressure so discourage relaxation. PILLOWS AND MATTRESSES: BETTER BEDDING . From the way it feels on your skin to the way it traps allergens to the way it aligns our spines, bedding has a tremendous impact on sleep. If you're a side sleeper, use a firm pillow to get a good night's rest. But, if you like to lie on your back, a medium-firm pillow will promote the best quality shut-eye - for those snoozing on their fronts, a soft pillow is recommended. According to the infographic, the average person move 40-60 times during the night - and so it's recommended to change a mattress every seven to eight years.",

The Football Association chairman admits his organisation\u2019s response to former West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle\u2019s death aged 59 in 2002, from \u2018industrial disease\u2019 linked to repetitive head injuries sustained playing football, was \u2018woefully inadequate\u2019. The FA and PFA promised a 10-year study to investigate the connection between head injuries and early on-set dementia after a coroner found Astle\u2019s brain \u2018resembled that of a boxer\u2019s\u2019 but a Mail on Sunday investigation last year revealed the research was never carried out. Jeff Astle's family were at The Hawthorns for 'Astle Day' as Baggies fans paid to tribute to the former striker . Jeff Astle's wife brings out the match ball ahead of the league clash between West Brom and Leicester . West Brom paid tribute to  Astle on 'Astle Day', the former Baggies striker at the age of 59 in 2002 due . Baggies striker Saido Berahino wore Astle's No 9 shirt during the Premier League match at The Hawthorns . Dyke went to The Hawthorns on Saturday for the launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of head injuries in football while funding future research, and he apologised for the FA\u2019s failure to acknowledge the significance of Astle\u2019s death. \u2018We promised the Astle family we would do some research and we didn\u2019t and that is a failure by the FA and yes, we are now going to do it,\u2019 Dyke told the Mail on Sunday. \u2018It\u2019s going to be done. There will be a piece of work about head injuries and football. We want to get FIFA involved as well because if we draw some profound conclusions we\u2019ll need to get everyone involved. \u2018We\u2019ll help fund the research and we\u2019ll put together a working group and we\u2019ll help fund it too. You need to separate the emotion and do the research and ask, \u201cWhat do we understand?\u201d The suggestion of the Astle family is that head injuries are more likely to lead to early on-set dementia and that is to do with heading the ball or physical contact. That\u2019s what we need to investigate and understand. \u2018Let\u2019s see what the research finds and get FIFA involved too because this isn\u2019t going to be a British-only phenomenon, it\u2019s going to be a worldwide phenomenon. It won\u2019t disappear, that is for certain. That was a bad mistake by the FA (to not carry out research).\u2019 West Bromwich Albion became only the second team in Premier League history to be granted permission to wear a replica strip on Saturday, with their shirts resembling those worn by the 1968 FA Cup-winning side in which Astle scored in every round including the final. Astle represented the Baggies for 10 years between 1964 and 1974 during his professional career . West Brom players\u00a0take to the pitch in a Astle commemorative kit ahead of their showdown with Leicester . A close up view of the Jeff Astle gates ahead of the Barclays Premier League match at West Brom . Their match against Leicester City was attended by his wife Laraine and daughters Dawn and Claire, who set up the Justice for Jeff campaign last season after being alerted to the FA and PFA\u2019s failure to deliver promised research by the Mail on Sunday. \u2018My Jeff died not knowing he had ever been a professional footballer,\u2019 Laraine said. \u2018We were promised research into the issue and it wasn\u2019t until we were alerted by the Mail on Sunday that it hadn\u2019t been carried out that we knew any different. None of this would have happened if it hadn\u2019t been for the Mail on Sunday.\u2019 West Brom\u2019s fans held up placards nine minutes into Saturday's game proclaiming \u2018Astle is King\u2019 in remembrance of a man whose death could yet prove the catalyst to drastic improvements to concussion protocols in sport. \u2018This is just too important to let go,\u2019 Dawn said. \u2018We have been inundated with calls from concerned families who believe their dads or husbands are suffering dementia prematurely because of the head injuries they suffered as professional footballers. \u2018There are too many cases for it to be coincidence. Sport\u2019s governing bodies have paid lip service to this for far too long and have been allowed to get away with it. That has to stop. The Mail on Sunday\u00a0revealed the Football Association did not carry out adequate research into Astle's death . West Brom fans display an 'Astle' banner during the ninth minute to represent the shirt number he wore at The Hawthorns . Greg Dyke\u00a0has vowed there will be no repeat of the FA\u2019s failure to deliver potentially life-saving research . \u2018My dad loved the game but ultimately it killed him. Everybody who plays the game needs to know that it comes with a risk. Players need to leave the field if they suffer a head injury. \u2018We\u2019ve been encouraged by the FA and PFA\u2019s response in recent months but it\u2019s taken them too long to address this.\u2019 Sections of Astle\u2019s brain were re-examined at Glasgow Southern General Hospital last year by Professor Willie Stewart, who confirmed the striker had been suffering from the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which was previously believed only to be found in boxers. But studies in the United States have revealed a far higher incidence of CTE in American footballers than the wider population, while sports including rugby, horse racing, boxing and ice hockey are also now on high alert following a massive lawsuit involving the NFL and retired players suffering dementia. Prof Stewart called Saturday's launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation \u2018a landmark day\u2019. He went on: \u2018Though Jeff was the first former footballer recognised with CTE, sadly he will not be the last. And the foundation will provide a source of information and support for people within sport affected by dementia, and their families. It has taken 13 years to get this far in football. We cannot allow another 13 years to slip by without action.\u2019 Saturday\u2019s match was attended by a host of celebrity backers, including 1966 World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks, as well as concussion campaigners like Peter Robinson, whose 14-year-old rugby-playing son Ben died in 2011 after being allowed to play on after suffering repeated blows to the head. \u2018If one person present at the game had recognised the signs of concussion or understood how dangerous it could be then my Ben would still be alive,\u2019 Peter Robinson said. \u2018There has been too much lip service paid to the issue in the past. It\u2019s time to act.\u2019",

According to the YouGov survey for the Sunday Times, 12 per cent of people questioned thought that the child should be named after William's mother - Diana the Princess of Wales. Kate and William\u00a0leaving the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, with their newborn son, Prince George in 2013. Brits are hoping for a baby princess this time and favour the name \u00a0Diana . Alice and Charlotte were next in terms of preference, getting nine per cent of the vote each. Alice is the name of the Queen's aunt, who passed away in 2004 aged 102, while Charlotte is favoured as a nod to William's father Charles. According to the newspaper, if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James, with the second favourite name being Alexander. Many people are hoping for a girl though - of the 2,200 people polled, a quarter said they wanted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to have a female baby, with only three percent hoping for a younger brother for George. Diana is the favourite name for the second royal baby, name after Williams mother - the late Princess Of Wales . The choices were echoed on social media today, with many Twitter users claiming they would be delighted if Kate and William decided to name the baby after his mother. One user called Danielle O'Donoghue wrote: 'If Kate Middleton has a baby girl and doesn't name her Diana I'll be so upset. Another said: 'If the new royal baby is a girl and is called Diana, either first name or middle name. I will be 90% more emotional.'

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)As Saudi forces pounded southern Yemen with a fresh series of airstrikes Wednesday, Houthi rebels called for peace talks. The U.N.-sponsored talks should resume \"but only after a complete halt of attacks,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in a Facebook post. The previous round of talks between Houthi rebels and the government of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi failed in January after rebels attacked the President's personal residence and presidential palace in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly monthlong air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni government military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, according to security sources in Taiz. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. Explosions lasted for about 40 minutes, they said. It was unclear whether it was a resumption of the operation or a short-term series of strikes. Meanwhile, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa on Wednesday, according to a senior Saudi source speaking on condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back \"security and stability through establishing a political process,\" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Hadi, who claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,\" said Hadi. In the country's south, security officials on Wednesday reported two U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants in Mukalla. Six suspected militants died in the attack. This is the second drone strike in three days. On Monday, six militants were killed when drone strikes targeted two vehicles in Shabwah, west of Mukalla. A U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday that the United States is conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last few days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Nic Robertson, Salim Essaid, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.",

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.' It is not known whether Gywneth's two children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, ten, and Moses, nine, will also be taking part in the challenge however, given the limited supply of food featured in her Twitter picture, it is thought the Shakespeare in Love star is going it alone this time around.",

A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to The Washington Post. \"The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her,\" and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he \"grabbed her arms when she resisted\" and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that  Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations \"very disturbing.\" \"Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. Earlier in September, an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. An independent report released in December found that the Secret Service is stretched \"beyond its limits,\" needing more training, more staff, and a director from outside its ranks. Clancy, who formally assumed the post in February, is a 27-year veteran of the agency. \"It's going to take time to change some of this culture,\" Clancy said at a House Appropriations Committee hearing last month. \"There's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain. That's going to take time because I'm going to have to build trust with our workforce.\" The incident will be further investigated by the Office of the Inspector General.",

Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. \"At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint,\" Jamie Davis said.  \"That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us.\" As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. \"At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known,\" said Troi Ge.  \"He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'\" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" Collins said. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.",

It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem \u2018irritating\u2019, \u2018annoying\u2019 and \u2018frustrating\u2019 and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad\u2019s Army and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC\u2019s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: \u2018Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off? 'All because you can\u2019t be bothered to check that whole show was there. Please, if you are going to make available a programme I have missed can I have the whole programme?\u2019 Another added: \u2018I enjoy radio drama immensely but just recently I have found that some final episodes have last the vital few minutes. I was simply left hanging in the air at a very crucial stage.\u2019 Shows such as Dad\u2019s Army and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes . According to the BBC\u2019s own figures, in February this year, 57million \u2018requests\u2019 were made for radio programmes on BBC iPlayer. Each request means a person chose to listen to a show. Of this number, one quarter were people listening to programmes on catch-up, a jump from one in five the previous month. As the use of catch-up becomes increasingly popular, more people will suffer from shows missing their final moments. Andrew Scott, General Manager of the BBC\u2019s Audience Facing Services, appeared on Feedback and apologised for the problem and said they are now adding two minutes to the end of all its recordings in an attempt to stamp out the problem. He told the programme: \u2018There are a lot of shows every week that are made available on demand and we simply can\u2019t humanly check every single one of those, so what we are trying to do is make sure we have the very best fail safe systems in place.\u2019",

The Inverness Caley Thistle centre-half will learn on Thursday whether he has been successful in challenging the one-match suspension offered by compliance officer Tony McGlennan. Meekings was charged over the handball that thwarted a Leigh Griffiths effort in their semi-final victory - an incident which also prompted Celtic to write to the SFA seeking \u2018an understanding\u2019 of why no penalty and red card followed. Inverness defender Josh Meekings' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to Celtic on Sunday . Meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match, the punishment he would have got if sent off . But Northern Irishman Boyce, who is also chairman of FIFA\u2019s referees committee, believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee Steven McLean and his assistants. \u2018This sets a very dangerous precedent, I am absolutely, 100 per cent against the compliance officer becoming involved because the referee\u2019s decision is final,\u2019 said Boyce. \u2018It is a totally different matter if someone has gone over the top, or committed a serious foul, or head-butted someone and the referee has missed it. \u2018Those are disciplinary issues. But what happened here is that the referee has made a mistake regarding a hand-ball and that\u2019s the end of it. There is no way the player should now be disciplined for that. \u2018Who is to say it was even intentional? If the Scottish FA or their referees committee decide that they feel a serious mistake was made then they could take action in the future against that referee. \u2018The only punishment, if any punishment at all is due, should be made if the Scottish FA feel the officials in charge of this game acted improperly and made the wrong decision.\u2019 FIFA's head of referees Jim Boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong . Inverness is appealing the ruling that, if upheld, will deny Meekings (right) a place in the Scottish Cup final . The SFA\u2019s disciplinary rules provide scope for action against sending-off offences not seen by the referee, including denying the opposition a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity. And former compliance officer Vincent Lunny believes Meekings should brace himself to miss the showpiece against Falkirk on May 30. \u2018Look at the different options \u2014 any way you look at it, he would have missed the final,\u2019 said Lunny. Meekings (right) celebrates Inverness's 3-2 win over Celtic in their Scottish Cup semi-final . \u2018I suppose it\u2019s natural to feel sympathetic for a player who is potentially missing out on a place in the Scottish Cup Final, which might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance. \u2018But if Steven McLean had seen it at the time, he\u2019d have been sent off and he\u2019d be missing the final had Inverness gone on to win; and if he (Meekings) hadn\u2019t done it, Celtic would have scored and there\u2019s a good chance they would have gone on to win, so again Josh Meekings would have missed the final. \u2018I think it will be an uphill struggle, especially after (Inverness manager) John Hughes\u2019s comments on the radio saying it was a sending-off matter.\u2019",

Jamal Kiyemba, 36, was detained in the Ugandan capital Kampala in connection with the death of Joan Kagezi, who was killed in front of her children days before a major trial against Islamist terror network Al-Shabaab. Kiyemba, a former pharmacy student at a university in Leicester, who grew up in London, was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years and awarded the huge payout after being released. Arrested: Ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner Jamal Kiyemba, 36 was detained in\u00a0Kampala over the brutal murder of top female prosecutor Joan Kagezi . The 36-year-old is one of 16 former Guantanamo prisoners awarded a \u00a320million payout from the British taxpayer over claims of false imprisonment and human rights abuse. His case was championed by Muslim human rights group CAGE, whose director infamously branded ISIS executioner Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi an 'extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was born in Uganda as Anthony Kiyemba, but converted to Islam aged 20, changing his name to Jamal Abdullah. When the family arrived in Britain following the death of his father in 1993, Kiyemba, then 14, was granted indefinite leave to remain, but never applied for British citizenship. Kiyemba was arrested near Peshawar in Pakistan in March 2002, after allegedly trying to enter Afghanistan in the company of 'a probable al-Qaeda operative, a suspected al-Qaeda operative and a low-level jihadist', U.S. military files reveal. Compensated: Kiyemba was awarded \u00a31million from the British government over claims he had been tortured by U.S. intelligence and interrogated by the MI5 at Guantanamo which had violated his human rights . Kiyemba, however, claims he had gone to Pakistan to study Arabic and the Koran because the country was 'very cheap'. Following his 2006 release, he claimed he had only admitted to terrorist activities under torture by American intelligence officers and that he had been interrogated by MI5. He was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years but as he was not a British citizen, he was not entitled to representation by the Foreign Office nor, on his release, to automatic rights to return to his family. Kiyemba, whose mother, four brothers and sister all live in Britain, was instead deported to Uganda, but made several attempts to be allowed back into the UK. 'I may not be British according to some bit of paper but in reality I am a Brit and always will be,' he said in an interview following his release. 'My doctor, my local mosque, my teens, my education, employment, friends, taxes, home and above all else my family - it is all in Britain.' Support: Kiyemba's compensation claims were championed by human rights charity CAGE, whose research director, Asim Qureshi, pictured, famously branded ISIS executioner Jihadi John a 'kind, beautiful' man . Kiyemba was arrested alongside three others in a suburb to Kampala on Tuesday as a result of an operation aided by U.S. officials, Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said. Jamal Kyiemba is one of 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees paid compensation by the British Government over claims of human rights abuse. A total of \u00a320million has been awarded to former prisoners in an out-of-court settlement after they made allegations against British intelligence, the Sun reports. Others include Shaker Aamer, 48, who still remains in Guantanamo after 13 years without charge or trial, despite being cleared for release twice. Once he is released Mr Aamer, from south London, should be entitled to \u00a31million. Ms Kagezi had been a prosecutor in the ongoing trial of 12 suspects accused of being involved in the July 2010 bombings in which 76 people were killed while watching the World Cup final on TV. Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab, who were behind the brutal massacre of nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university this month, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this year, Ms Kagezi had been appointed Head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. Kagezi was shot twice by gunmen after she left her car \u2014 in which she was traveling with two of her children on the way home from work \u2014 to buy groceries in a Kampala suburb. After shooting her in the head and neck, the gunmen fled on a motorcycle, according to police. Ugandan police say there is not yet conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the murder of Ms Kagezi, but that detectives were questioning him about any possible role and about other offenses. Kiyemba has yet to comment on the allegations. Ugandan police on Tuesday arrested at least six suspects.",

The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government\u2019s health promotions agency, which says more action is needed to tackle the \u2018continuing problem\u2019 of \u2018hazardous alcohol consumption in young people\u2019. The move would apply in pubs, clubs, supermarkets and off-licences in Scotland. New measure: Health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking . If introduced it would mean the legal minimum age for buying alcohol would be higher in Scotland than it is in the rest of Britain, where it is 18. Last night Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said he would welcome the minimum age being set at 21. He said: \u2018If it was 21 now, I would not be calling for it to be lowered.\u2019 But he added: \u2018Given the fact that we are where we are, I think that politically it is quite difficult, when the age is 18 for so many other adult rites in our society.\u2019 The proposal to raise the legal age is outlined in a report titled \u2018Best Preventative Investments for Scotland \u2013 What the Evidence and Experts Say\u2019, which examines mea-sures to improve public health. It says the idea to \u2018increase the minimum legal drinking age to 21 would be highly cost-effective, as it would both improve people\u2019s health without having to spend much money, and reduce demand on the NHS\u2019. Report author Neil Craig said: \u2018In Scotland, hazardous alcohol consumption in young people is a continuing problem. \u2018For both males and females, the largest increase in hospitalisation rates for alcohol-related conditions since the early 1980s has been in the 15-24 year olds, and this was particularly marked for females.\u2019 In fact, doctors across the whole of Britain are worried about the increase in such hospitalisations. Between 2002 and 2010, the number of admissions to English hospitals among 15 to 24 year olds due to alcohol rose by 66 per cent to 55,655 \u2013 or more than 150 a day. The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government\u2019s health promotions agency . The increase among women (76 per cent) was higher than in men (57 per cent). While the Government in Westminster has been reluctant to legislate to tackle the alcohol problem, the Scottish Government has had far fewer reservations. It has already agreed a 50p minimum unit price for alcohol, although the controversial move will not be implemented if the Scottish Whisky Association succeeds in an ongoing court battle to block it. The Scottish Government has also banned \u2018BOGOF\u2019 (buy-one-get-one-free) deals and other offers encouraging bulk-buying of alcohol, and reduced the drink driving limit. A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u2018We remain open to the consideration of any evidence-based proposals that can contribute to reducing alcohol-related harm.\u2019 A Department of Health spokesman in London said: \u2018There are no plans to increase the legal age for buying alcohol.\u2019",

But at a track meet Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, a crowd of more than 3,000 people saw the distance evaporate after Pepiot raised his hands in pre-emptive joy, with less than 100m to go. Tanguy\u00a0Pepiot\u00a0celebrated his victory (left) before missing out to his rival on the finishing line (right) Pepiot (right)\u00a0is pictured raising his hands to excite the crowd - as Meron Simon (left) tears toward him . The gesture seemed to sap some of his momentum, opening the way for Simon to speed towards the finish line, and beat him by a tenth of a second. The home crowd roared as Simon powered ahead - seemingly in an attempt to warn French-born Pepiot. But the warning came too late, and Simon flashed past, leaving Pepiot, who is in his senior year, to collapse, defeated. Simon's time, 8:57.86, exceeded his personal record by around 15 seconds. Speaking to the Eugene Register-Guard\u00a0after the contest, a newly-victorious Simon said: 'I thought he had me. Simon edges past Meriot as the pair approach the line, eventually beating him by a tenth of a second . After celebrating his triumph, Simon headed back to help\u00a0Pepiot up after he collapsed to the ground in defeat . 'I thought he was just so far ahead. Then I heard the crowd get crazy, and he started throwing his hands up. 'I was like, \"I don\u2019t think he knows I\u2019m coming\". I just went to the line and just raced.' After a justified victory celebration of his own, Simon doubled back to console his close rival. Not long after, a defeated Pepiot told columnist Austin Meek: 'I think it was the first time it happened to me. I'll make sure it's the last time.' Meron (left) ran his best ever\u00a0time in the 3,000m steeplechase, while\u00a0Pepiot\u00a0has pledged not to get cocky again .",

Weinsten and his designer wife Georgina Chapman turned up for the premiere of his new Broadway production Finding Neverland in New York City. The play, which stars Glee star Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer, is based on the 2004 film of the same name Weinstein produced starring Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp. The couple have been out together numerous times over the past few weeks as well, attending Finding Neverland rehearsals, celebrating Easter together with their children, and at a party for Georgina\u2019s birthday earlier in the week. Scroll down for video . Harvey Weinsten and his designer wife Georgina Chapman (above) turned up for the premiere of his new Broadway play Finding Neverland on Wednesday . Composer Gary Barlow, actor Matthew Morrison,  Weinstein, actress Laura Michelle Kelly and actor Kelsey Grammer at the premiere . The happy couple were joined by stars including Helen Mirren, Bryan Cranston, Ansel Elgort, Darren Criss, Olivia Wilde and Christoph Waltz for the opening night of the play, which received disastrous reviews from critics. New York Magazine called the show 'badly written' and 'frustrating,' while the New York Times\u00a0said the production is 'largely made up of empty calories.' Ambra Battilana (above) claimed Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt during a meeting at his office in March . Earlier this week Chapman shared a photo of the birthday flowers (above) Weinstein sent her . And while Weinstein may not be thrilled with these reviews, he is not doubt happy with the news that he will not be facing criminal charges for last month's groping incident. District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said last Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. 'After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.' Ambra Battilana claimed Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt during a meeting at his office in March. Olivia Wilde (left) and Georgina Chapman (right) attend The Opening Night performance of Finding Neverland on Broadway at The Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Wednesday night in New York City . The model, 22, also claimed Weinstein asked if her boobs were real. Weinstein reportedly cooperated with police throughout their investigation. The perfectly polished Chapman, 38, and notoriously brash Weinstein, 63, began dating in late 2004 and were married three years later at their Connecticut estate. The wedding, in which the British beauty wore one of her own Marchesa designs, was packed with celebrities, including Cameron Diaz, Renee Zellweger, Naomi Watts, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez and Vogue editrix Anna Wintour, to name just a few. They welcomed daughter India in 2010 and son Dashiell three years later. Weinstein and Chapman were last photographed together at this year's Academy Awards (above)",

The Biancoceleste, who have scored 18 goals and conceded just one in their last six Italian league games, will attempt to solidify their grip on second place. A victory would leave them nine points behind Juve with seven games remaining. Lazio, lead by Miroslav Klose and Felipe Anderson, have won eight games in a row in Serie A . Head coach Stefano Pioli says his side will go 'all out for victory' against Juventus on Saturday . Juventus are unbeaten at home this season but they did slip to just their second defeat of the campaign last weekend in a major upset at bottom-side Parma. 'I'm satisfied with what we have done,' Lazio coach Stefano Pioli said to the Italian press. However, he stressed: 'We have not achieved anything yet. 'We need to continue to work with focus. 'There are many games left to play before we can celebrate. 'Against Juve we will try to go all out for victory. 'We don't want to have any regrets after the game.' The clash with Lazio comes at the start of a challenging week for Juve. Massimiliano Allegri's team travels to Montecarlo on Tuesday for the return leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Monaco holding a 1-0 advantage. The Bianconeri will then take on Torino four days later in the Turin derby. Felipe Andrson celebrates after scoring during the 4-0 rout against Empoli last Sunday . Lazio face Massimiliano Allegri's (pictured) Juventus, and will cut the gap to nine points with victory . Roma have won just two of their last eight league games to fall to third in the standings, one point adrift of Lazio. The Giallorossi hold the last Champions League qualifying spot and host Atalanta on Sunday. At the other end of the table, bottom-side Parma go into Sunday's match at Empoli following another major blow. The club was docked four points on Thursday as punishment related to their financial troubles. Parma had already been hit with a three-point deduction earlier this season for failing to pay players. The latest setback has left Parma 18 points adrift of safety with 24 points still up for grabs. Napoli, seven points behind Roma, take on relegation-threatened Cagliari in Sardinia. Rafael Benitez's side won 4-1 triumph at Wolfsburg in the first leg of its Europa League quarter-final tie Thursday. Fiorentina are one place and one point behind Napoli and host Hellas Verona on Monday. The Viola were also involved in Europa League action this week and held Dynamo Kiev to a 1-1 draw in the opening leg in Ukraine. Napoli will be looking to build on their impressive Europa League win against Hellas Verona on Monday . Sampdoria, who host third-bottom Cesena on Saturday, are unbeaten at their Luigi Ferraris stadium this season. Inter Milan and AC Milan clash at the San Siro on Sunday night. AC Milan are ninth in the standings, one place an one point clear of Inter and seven points adrift of the Europa League qualifying places. Torino have clinched seven points of a possible nine in their last three games to remain in contention for European football next season . The Granata are in eighth place and play at Sassuolo on Sunday. A win over Genoa on Sunday would be enough for Palermo to defend their Serie A status. The Sicilian club have collected 38 points so far to move 16 points clear of the drop zone. Udinese, without a victory since March 8 and in the midst of a five-match winless streak, travel to Verona to face Chievo. Both Inter and AC Milan are struggling for form ahead of this weekend's derby match .",
