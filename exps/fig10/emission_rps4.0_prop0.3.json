Moments later, Beaudoin got into a fight with his wife of 18 years, Christina Nelson, in the master bedroom, reported Click2Houston. When the couple's 22-year-old son tried to intervene, deputies say the father pulled out a 9mm handgun and shot him twice in the back. The armed man then allegedly threatened his 18-year-old son, sending the teen fleeing for his life. The boy ran to a neighbor for help, crying hysterically and begging her to call 911 and then check up on his older brother, who had been shot. Nelson was pronounced dead at the scene from his wounds.

Engraved with the words, \"Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny,\" the antique ring lodged in the rocks clearly meant something to both Joe and Jenny. But there were no other clues (besides the fact that the words were written in English) as to where the couple might live.

She went to the 5,000 members of her company's Facebook page, Kids in Adelaide, to reunite Joe and Jenny with the ring. She also created a \"Find Joe and Jenny\" page to track them down. \"Hi all. It's Roxy here. This is a reaaaallyy long shot but would love some SHARE love on this post to help find Joe. Found this gold ring snorkeling at Finns Beach in Bali today. It's got a family crest on it, and engraved with the message 'Darling Joe, Happy 70th Birthday 2009. Love Jenny' How amazing would it be to find him! Please click share.\" The post got shared all over the world. Nine months earlier, Joe Langley had been snorkeling in the same spot in Bali when he lost the ring, which his wife, Jenny, had purchased an antique store and had engraved for his birthday. \"I went for a swim, got caught in a rip, decided the rip was going to take me and finished up on the rocks,\" Langley told Sunshine Coast Daily. \"In clawing my way over the rocks, the ring pulled off my finger.\" The Langleys' 19-year-old granddaughter saw the Facebook post April 9 and made the connection. It turns out that the Langleys are fellow Australians, living in the town of Noosa, just three hours from where Walsh lives in Palm Beach. Walsh had the ring professionally cleaned before she met the happy Langleys in Noosa to return it.",

If you have the bank balance of a mogul you could splash out on the house used for location shoots in the Fox show, which is filmed in the Chicago area. The enormous 20,000 square foot mansion in the ritzy suburb of Barrington is opulent and private, sitting by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens. Scroll Down for Video . Fit for a mogul - the enormous mansion serves as the backdrop to the hit show Empire . It took five years to build the house, which sits by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens . The\u00a0sophisticated\u00a0five bedroom, nine bathroom French Country-style estate that serves as a glamorous backdrop to the show is listed at $13 million, having failed to find a buyer at $15.9 million since it first hit the market in 2013. It took five years to build the enormous mansion, with construction finally coming to a halt in 2008. This lengthy building period was partly due to the huge amount of custom woodwork and ornamentation in the house. The show centers on Lucious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, deciding which of his three sons will take over his company, Empire Entertainment . For the show, the interiors are staged often to look more dramatic than the house does in real life . The mansion even has an owner worthy of Empire, in strip club owner Sam Cecola, according to Curbed. Cecola owns the Admiral Theater strip club in Albany Park, Illinois, and previously owned the Club Paradise strip club in Las Vegas. He had to relinquish ownership of the Las Vegas property due to legal problems involving tax fraud and alleged connections to organized crime. As in the show, the stately living room features a grand piano . The house is as opulent in real life as it is in the show and has a lot of room for entertaining . The house includes a wet bar, walnut-paneled library, huge gourmet kitchen and a built-in safe and state-of-the-art security system. Outside there is a dog run, an outdoor pool, outdoor fireplace and a pond, as well as extensive waterfront views. A full bar opens out onto a terrace and the garden on the lower level . A light bright dining room just off the grand hallway . In the show, Luscious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, has been diagnosed with ALS and is trying to determine which of his three sons will succeed him and run his entertainment business. His outspoken ex-wife, Cookie, played by Taraji P. Henson, is fresh out of prison after 17 years for drug dealing and is also demanding her share of the business. The bedrooms are simply and elegantly decorated in a tasteful color palette . In the show, Lucious' daughter Lola has a bedroom fit for a princess . The formal walnut-paneled study is deeply masculine and worthy of an industry mogul . Lucious' study on the show is darker and more dramatic .",

Interviewer Diane Sawyer looked shocked when he made the revelation on her ABC 20/20 special last night. Jenner said 'I've always been on the more conservative side' when he was asked about LGBT issues - and replied 'yes' when asked if he was a Republican. Sawyer had mentioned President's decision to identify trans citizens in his most recent State of The Union address. Jenner said:\u00a0\u201cHe actually was the first one to say the actual word transgender, I will certainly give him credit for that.' 'But not to get political, I\u2019ve just never been a big fan \u2014 I\u2019m kind of more on the conservative side.' Scroll down for video . Republican: Bruce Jenner told Diane Sawyer he is a Republican as he announced his transition to a woman on Friday night . Jenner added that neither the Republicans nor Democrats had a 'monopoly on understanding' and said he would lobby the GOP over LGBT rights. 'I would do that, yeah, in a heartbeat,' he said. He also said in the interview that he still considers himself a heterosexual, discussed his faith and said he was a Christian. 'I would sit in church and always wonder, \"In God\u2019s eyes, how does he see me?\"' he said. 'Maybe this is my cause in life.' His remarks came in the Friday night interview in which Jenner  revealed that he identifies as a woman - his 'true self' and a childhood dream - in an explosive ABC interview with Diane Sawyer. The 65-year-old Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star sparked rumors about his gender identity last year after visibly altering his appearance. And last night, he confirmed that he is reinventing himself physically in a bid to transition from male to female in the highly-anticipated, intimate sit-down. Speaking in front of millions of viewers, including Kim Kardashian and her family, Bruce tearfully revealed: 'For all intents and purposes, I am a woman. Christian: Jenner also said that he is a Christian and wondered whether transitioning to a woman was his cause in life . 'My brain is much more female than it is male. That's what my soul is. Bruce lives a lie. She is not a lie.' He firmly added: 'I can't do it anymore.' During the interview, Bruce also admitted that he has been regularly taking female hormones - and plans to completely transform into a woman. But he said he was still attracted to females. 'I was never attracted to the guys,' he told Diane, explaining how he has always enjoyed a good sex life. And he denied that his revelations were for publicity purposes. Instead, he made them due to his inability to continue to 'pull the curtain', he said. Indeed, hiding his identity was so painful for Bruce that it once left him contemplating suicide to escape from the never-ending scrutiny, he revealed. Many viewers and celebrities were taking to social media last night to congratulate Bruce on making a giant leap for the transgender community. Lady Gaga tweeted: '#BruceJennerABC Now that is bravery', before telling her fans to 'empower people like Bruce' globally by 'being loving & not mean'. Meanwhile, Bruce's 17-year-old daughter, Kylie Jenner, tweeted an emotional message to her father. 'Understandingly, this has been very hard for me. You will hear what I have to say when I'm ready to but this isn't about me. I'm so proud of you, Dad. You are so brave. My beautiful Hero,' she wrote.",

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Last year: Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt last November \u00a0after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game against Hiram University . Never give up: Lauren, picture on March 22, is vowing to never give up her battle with rare brain cancer . A team player: Lauren is working with her doctors and family to fight the disease that will likely kill her . Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center at hospital) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain .",

These days, his Mara Group spans over 20 countries and he's been called \"Africa's youngest billionaire.\" In late 2013 Thakkar joined forces with the former boss of Barclays bank -- Bob Diamond -- to start an investment fund focused on Africa called Atlas Mara. The powerful duo raised $325 million through a share flotation - well above the $250 million target. But his vision spans beyond Africa, and Earth -- Thakkar was the first African to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic. CNN's Marketplace Africa spoke to Thakkar about African innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN:  You are active in several African countries. How is the current business landscape on the continent? Ashish Thakkar: Right now in the last 18 years I have been active on the continent, I have never seen so much global excitement around Africa that I've seen today. The climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved. Unfortunately, it's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality. The reality on the ground is so much better than the perception. You've got to remember, as Africa, we are 54 countries. Some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues, but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit. CNN: Why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the African continent? AT: We have a very young demographic -- 85% of our populations are under the age of 35. We have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture. Yet, entrepreneurship is not in the education system. Where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance? And it's something, frankly, that I am extremely passionate about, because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants, etc. It's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises. So, it's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system, and innovation is totally embedded into that. CNN: What is it about Africa that encourages innovation? AT: The biggest advantage we have at the moment, and you've seen this with mobile phone penetration, is that we don't have legacy systems. We didn't have landlines and we didn't need them. We didn't have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere. We leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony. Today, we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than North America and Western Europe put together. We can actually leapfrog in so many different ways. Mobile money is another brilliant example. Mobile money was created in Kenya. The whole concept of having money on your phone, which is the best thing because it's secure, it's practical, made more sense. So, these kind of innovations, you're going to see a lot more of on the continent. I spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when I travel across the continent, and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they're coming up with is just so inspiring. CNN: What advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who's just starting out? AT: Entrepreneurship is a journey, it's not a destination. There are going to be so many challenges, you are going to get knocked down so many times, but you've got to get up, dust yourself off and get back to it. The persistence, the passion, and staying on course is very crucial. You'll be tempted to cut corners, you'll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker, but it never lasts. People say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we're not. We're the leaders of today, but it's our responsibility to take the seat at the table. CNN: What needs to be done most urgently to grow African economies? AT: Pan-African collaboration is extremely important. I think things like regional integration, inter-African trade does need to increase and is increasing. I mean, the progress in the East African community has been amazing. The manner in which they've harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic. So, we need to see more of that take place on the continent. The fact that we're 54 countries, yet we're a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage. I think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial. CNN: Are you confident about the future of the continent? AT: I am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership, the mindset of our leaders. It is so inspiring to see that. It's unfortunate that, you know, globally the highlight remains things like Ebola...The little issues that we do have are just magnified, yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing. CNN: Is this Africa's century? AT: Mara's logo is the African Lion and our little joke, which a lot of people don't appreciate, hence I love it even more, is that the Indian Tiger and the Chinese Dragon have had their days and it's now the African Lion's turn. And it genuinely is -- this is our turn. More from Marketplace Africa . Read this: Africa's green lean speed machines . Read this: Family ties mixed with fresh fruit on island paradise .

Jessa, 22, and her 19-year-old husband Ben   announced the\u00a0the news of their pregnancy ina video for\u00a0TLC.com, which featured them both\u00a0making health smoothies, and Jessa has revealed that one of the first things the couple considered after hearing the news was how to adjust her workouts accordingly, to ensure that she can remain fit and active while expecting. Speaking to People magazine, the reality star explained that when it comes to exercising: 'I'm just trying not to overdo it right now. I am still working out, but not trying to break any records. Scroll down for video . Expecting: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald recently revealed that she is pregnant with their first child . Announcement: The baby is due on November 1, which is also the date of Ben and Jessa's first wedding anniversary . 'I want to gain a little less weight and not stress out about it. I do want to make sure that I'm eating healthy. You are eating for two but the other is, like, a speck. I am trying to make healthy choices now that I'm entering my second trimester.' The pair, who married after a chaste courtship, are well-known for their health-conscious lifestyle and are often seen on the Duggars\u2019 hit reality series enjoying healthy dinners or working out together, something which viewers saw frequently during the build-up to the couple\u2019s wedding, during which time Jessa was incredibly keen to trim down her already-toned physique. A recent episode of the show even saw Jessa pushing Ben's truck down the road while wearing workout pants covered with knee-length skirts to maintain their 'standard of modesty'. Jessa also frequently posts recipes and photos of healthy foods she's trying out on Instagram. Juiced up: Jessa and Ben are both champions of healthy eating, and even announced their pregnancy in an adorable video while making smoothies . Push it along: While getting ready for her wedding, Jessa stepped up her workout, part of which involved pushing her fiance's truck down a dirt road with her siblings inside . Interesting attire: The women in the religious Duggar family wear skirts over their workout pants to maintain their 'standard of modesty' As for her pregnancy diet, when Jessa discovered the news, she said that she thought she would take after other Duggar mothers when it came to her pregnancy cravings, but admitted that this hasn\u2019t been the case. 'I am feeling pretty good,' she added to People. 'I thought I'd crave pickles and lemons because my mother did, but I couldn't stand them. 'I'm hoping I'm having triplets because I've been eating so much!' However, Jessa does admit she will be looking to her older sister Jill for advice, as the 23-year-old just welcomed a son Israel with husband Derick Dillard on April 6, and is also a trained midwife. Jill kept up her exercise during the later months of pregnancy by\u00a0walking on the treadmill while listening to sermons. 70 hours later: Jessa's sister Jill Dillard (pictured) welcomed her son Israel on April 6 with her husband Derick after almost three full days of labor . Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c) Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.",

Isco returned to the starting XI for the second leg of the Madrid derby in the quarter-finals, as injuries to Gareth Bale and Luka Modric forced Ancelotti into a change of system.

Despite its secluded location it is home to the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy,\u00a0the world's largest Buddhist settlement. A vibrant splash of red, this colourful settlement has sprung up in the 1980s and is now a haven for over 40,000 monks and nuns. Larung Gar Buddhist Academy is home to 40,000 monks and nuns, who travel to the settlement of\u00a0Sertar to study Tibetan Buddhism . The red and brown houses are nearly identical, with one to three rooms per hut and no heating or toilets installed . The settlement is home to 40,000 nuns and monks, who flock to study, attend lectures and dwell in the mountains . Local children gather after class on one of the banks in the hilly religious institution. Monks and nuns are segregated by a winding road . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study at the remote dwelling. The wooden huts are built so closely together, they look like a red sea spreading up the hilly terrain. Nuns and monks are housed near to their colleges, and separated by age and sex. The segregation of male and female living quarters is marked by a winding road, which weaves through the dense mass of huts. All monks and nuns live close to the college but are housed in different district according the age and sex of students . Prayer forms an important part in the life of the monks who travel from multiple countries to attend lectures and classes in the area . Sky burials are common in the province of Tibet and involve corpses being cut and left for animals to devour. The human bodies are placed on mountaintops in order for the elements or predatory animals, typically vultures, to prey upon it. The majority of Tibetans and many Mongolians adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits. They believe after death the body is an empty vessel and there is no need to preserve it. By allowing nature or animals to take command of the body, they are disposing of the remains in the most generous way. In many areas of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and, due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical. Conditions are basic, with residents having to share communal toilets, and each unheated hut ranging from one to three rooms in size. An isolated religious haven, Sertar is located around 370 miles from Chengdu, and those wishing to visit have to travel by coach for a gruelling 20 hours. TVs are prohibited at the picturesque retreat, with monks and nuns flocking to benefit from the studies, prayers and lectures ran at the academy. The settlement has grown from a handful of disciples in the 1980s to become one of the largest centres for the study of Tibetan Buddhism . Prayer is undertaken by spinning the decorative prayer wheels which are located around the Buddhist settlement . Monks study after their lessons. Visitors are welcomed into the monastery to learn and witness the classes . Monks pray inside the biggest temple of the town. Inside, children and adults gather on the floor to sing songs . Photographer Wanson Luk journeyed to the secluded location from Chengdu on a 20-hour bumpy coach ride. The 34-year-old Buddhist said the Larung Area has two small guest houses, but as these were occupied, he had to stay near the entrance. He stayed two days at the Buddhist centre, taking part in ceremonies. Luk said that the settlement welcomes everyone, and they maintain their life in the hills from donations and by small businesses like the guest house or small grocery store. Sertar attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia . Tibetan monks, also known as lamas, are pictured at a grocery in the Serthar Buddhist Institute in China . 'I was most surprised about how people feel about death,' Luk said. 'I took part in the sky burial ceremony where there were hundreds or thousands of condors waiting quietly.\u00a0There were 7 corpses on that day...one of them was a child. 'During the ceremony a monk will pray then the \"sky burial master\" will start cutting the corpses.\u00a0When he is done, the condors will all fly to the corpses . 'They believe the more the condors eat, the better it is and they will not eat bad people's body.' Nuns travel to school by walking down the steep verges which can peak at nearly three miles high . Snow covers the surrounding hills of the\u00a0Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, where conditions can be bleak in the winter months . The resplendent Buddhist monastery is the focal feature of the academy, with a wall to prevent monks and nuns from mingling . At the peak close to the town, monks tie colourful prayer flags as a practical sign of their religious devotion . One encounter which struck a chord for Luk was the meeting of a nun who was on her 'no speech day'. When the photographer was asking how to get to the top of the hill for night shots she resorted to all forms of gestures to try to assist. She ended up taking him around the whole monastery, showing him how to spin the prayer wheels and teaching him how to pray. Although TVs are prohibited in the monastery, iPhones strangely are permitted, with her typing words to instruct him as they went. At night the view of the Serthar Buddhist Institute is magical, with thousands of little lights illuminating the rolling hills . The settlement is also home to a number of Tibetan people who share the land with the monks and nuns . Prayer stones decorate the colourful Buddhist academy, which is only accessible by a long coach journey . Tibetan nuns, also known as lamas, are pictured on a street in the Serthar Buddhist Institute . The sprawling settlement, Sertar, sits on elevations of 12,500ft, and the religious devotees battle harsh climates to study here . Many of the Buddhists own second-hand  iPhone 4s. The incredible academy was established in 1980 in the uninhabited valley by Jigme Phuntsok, an influential lama of the Nyingma tradition. Despite its remote situation, Larung Gar evolved from a handful of disciples to be the largest Buddhist settlement in the world. It attracts a mix of students from ethnic Chinese students to pupils from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, who attend separate classes taught in Mandarin, while larger classes are taught in Tibetan.",

Footage shows the driver of a black SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, coming off at the 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane. She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course.

Ron Turbeville, with the Waxahachie police department, said that she was found 'inebriated' and \u00a0'smelling of alcohol' by medics who pulled her from her crushed Chevrolet Suburban. He added: 'Basically, based off that from the attending paramedics and firefighters, there was enough evidence there to suggest that she was drinking. 'That is the reason why we got a warrant for her blood.' After undergoing treatment, Mayeaux apparently admitted to police that she was trying to take her own life. She was released from hospital last Friday. In a puff of smoke: Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air . Suicide attempt: Police said the driver in the Chevrolet Suburban SUV, identified as 49-year-old Laura Michelle Mayeaux, later admitted she was trying to take her own life .

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

On this faltering, unconvincing evidence, the holders of the last Heineken Cup face a mammoth task if they are to stop Clermont Auvergne from claiming the inaugural Champions Cup. Bernard Laporte\u2019s stellar side didn\u2019t come to life until this dismal encounter went into extra-time and they were only galvanised once they had been reduced to 14 men, when Ali Williams was sin-binned for taking out Devin Toner in the air. Toulon winger\u00a0Bryan Habana races away for a decisive try in extra-time against Leinster . Habana intercepted Ian Madigan's long pass to race away unopposed at Stade\u00a0Velodrome . Leinster full back Rob Kearney beats Toulon flanker\u00a0Juan Fernandez Lobbe to a high ball in the first-half . Instead of being undermined by the loss of the ex-All Blacks lock, Toulon scored the crucial points while he was off the field. Their victory was founded on the composed goal-kicking of their Welsh Lion at full-back, Leigh Halfpenny, who finished with 20 points from six penalties and a conversion. Leinster attempted to capitalise on their numerical advantage and it backfired in the 90th minute as Ian Madigan\u2019s long pass was intercepted by Bryan Habana and the Springbok wing stormed clear to for the game\u2019s only try. That the one fleeting flicker of creativity stemmed from an error was fitting. The Irish province wouldn\u2019t go quietly and when Sean O\u2019Brien went over from a close-range lineout drive, they were back in the hunt with five minutes remaining, but it wasn\u2019t to be. So, the climax of the new continental tournament will have a familiar feel. Toulon vs Clermont is an all-French repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final in Dublin, which the Cote d\u2019Azur club won despite being dominated by Clermont for much of the game. Last year, they gave Jonny Wilkinson the perfect career sign-off with another triumph in Cardiff \u2013 where Saracens were dispatched \u2013 and now they are closing in on a hat-trick. But there was no swagger about them on Sunday, or any sustained power surges for that matter. It was unusually wet by the Mediterranean and the conditions made handling difficult, but that didn\u2019t account for the sheer deluge of fumbles made by both sides. As a showcase of Europe\u2019s elite event, this stop-start contest left much to be desired. For all the effort and commitment, there was no fluency or cohesion, no rhythm or flow. The teams simply took it in turns to launch a raid and either spill the ball or concede a turnover. Leinster centre Madigan fires over one of his five successful penalties against Toulon . English referee Wayne Barnes became the pantomime villain of the home supporters for repeatedly penalising their idols, but he had every right to on several occasions, particularly when Xavier Chiocci, the Toulon loosehead prop, was being dismantled by Ireland tighthead Mike Ross in the scrum. As an occasion, this was several notches below the blood-and-thunder epic between Clermont and Saracens in St Etienne 24 hours earlier. Clermont\u2019s \u2018Yellow Army\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018Jaunards\u2019 \u2013 created a raucous, partisan atmosphere which wasn\u2019t matched here by the Toulon hordes. There was a healthy crowd in excess of 35,000, but that was a long way short of capacity and the noise was often restricted to boos for the officials. Even the Mexican Waves late on were half-hearted. Leinster blindside Jordi Murphy does brilliantly to get up and disrupt a Toulon lineout . Still, it was not all grim. Steffon Armitage made his trademark breakdown impact after coming on as a replacement and Halfpenny\u2019s class stood out throughout \u2013 not just as a goal-kicker but, crucially, in the way he handled the aerial onslaught with aplomb. The Wales idol had landed four penalties in normal time but saved his best for the end of the first half of extra-time \u2013 just before Habana\u2019s try \u2013 when he struck from halfway, with inches to spare. Afterwards, he reflected on the prospect of a first appearance in Europe\u2019s elite final, saying: \u2018It\u2019s what I grew up dreaming about. Toulon No 8\u00a0Chris Masoe makes a strong run as Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss tries to make the tackle . \u2018I grew up watching European Cup Finals and you work hard day-in, day-out to be involved in big games like that. For me, coming to Toulon with the success they\u2019 ve achieved and the ambition they have, I wanted to be part of that. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity.\u2019 Toulon were fortunate that he took his opportunities on Sunday. It meant that their shortcomings were not critically exposed and they will surely rouse themselves to far greater heights for the final. Their showdown with Clermont will shake Twickenham to its foundations. These twin French giants are the dominant forces of the era - the rest of Europe are chasing their shadows. Toulon full back Leigh Halfpenny makes no mistake from the kicking tee after Leinster infringed .",

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members \u2013 something that anyone can become by joining free \u2013 while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team.

Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury.

His views were echoed, more robustly, by commentators and fans alike. That might not be the end of the short-term Kiwi exodus, despite Jerome Kaino\u2019s decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the Lions in 2017. Charles Piutau rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast . Fly-half Colin Slade is thought to be deciding between a move to Toulon or Pau in France \u2013 while the latter club have already landed Conrad Smith. The prospect of piles of Euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the Top 14 league the destination du jour, for southern stars seeking a stint abroad. What makes the Piutau deal so eye-catching is that it is a bold endorsement of Ulster\u2019s ambition and also a boost to the wider Celtic game, below Test level. That boost is much-needed, because there are simmering problems \u2013 as exposed and bemoaned by Leinster\u2019s head coach Matt O\u2019Connor last weekend. The Australian was infuriated by the softly-softly stance of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose final say on release of Test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the Pro 12 clash with leaders Glasgow. Alun Wyn Jones can put his body on the line for\u00a0Ospreys and Wales . \u2018It hurts the league,\u2019 said the Australian, which is absolutely true. The Pro 12 has a credibility issue, due to the continuing absence of so many Irish stars from so many matches. While player welfare is quite rightly prioritised, there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions. No wonder the Welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the Aviva Premiership clubs during the European rebellion last year. A leading figure such as Alun Wyn Jones gives body and soul to the Ospreys week after week, but still found the energy to face down the more rested Irish in Cardiff during the Six Nations. He and so many others in Wales would enhance the Premiership. If the Irish cannot fully commit to a league \u2013 making it a fitting stage for Piutau\u2019s class \u2013 they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for European combat with their provinces. Scrap the LV Cup and bring the regions into an expanded Premiership. Job done. Wasps forward Hughes\u00a0was clumsy, not reckless . Wasps players were incensed by the three-game ban handed to their No 8, Nathan Hughes, for the collision which left George North unconscious last Friday night, and their angst is understandable. The big Fijian was clumsy, but no more, by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the Lions wing, as he scored a try. Nathan Hughes\u00a0was clumsy rather than\u00a0reckless and didn't deserve a three-game ban . The disciplinary panel called the offence \u2018reckless\u2019 and the reaction of Wasps captain James Haskell was priceless. \u2018Rugby is reckless,\u2019 he said. \u2018The whole game is reckless. If you\u2019re going to worry about that\u2026 maybe we should all be wearing foam suits and playing touch.\u2019 The England flanker had a point. The sport is founded on physicality and danger. A player who has scored a try deserves to be protected from belated, damaging contact, however accidental, but the suspicion lingers that Hughes is serving a ban because North was knocked out. If the scorer had jumped up and walked off, it\u2019s fair to guess that the red card might have sufficed. Fill World Cup seats or face fan fury . Is anyone really surprised that trying to buy World Cup tickets is such a drawn-out ordeal? For those without the benefit of a corporate invite (or a media pass, before anyone pipes up), securing entry to a modern sporting showpiece is as appealing as a morning of root-canal treatment and as likely to deliver the desired outcome as a lottery ticket. The Webb Ellis Cup visits a school in Toronto as part of the Rugby World Cup Trophy Tour . We are in the cost-cutting age of do-it-all-online, so thousands of wannabe spectators were forced to endure endless hours of staring at a seemingly frozen screen on Monday. At least the old-fashioned system of queuing in person could foster a certain collective spirit, as so wonderfully evident at Wimbledon tennis down the years. Ultimately, the World Cup will be a sell-out, but organisers better be right when they say there won\u2019t be the empty seats which blighted the Olympics. As if being stuck on the outside with noses pressed against the glass is not bad enough, those denied tickets will be apoplectic if hordes of well-heeled \u2018guests\u2019 can\u2019t be bothered to leave their plush marquee and venture into the arena, or even turn up at all. Signing Sinfield is an inspired move . It\u2019s been dismissed in some quarters as a mere publicity stunt, which is harsh on all concerned. Kevin Sinfield is a colossus of rugby league who is switching codes in Leeds later this year, from the Rhinos to Yorkshire Carnegie. Yorkshire Carnegie's signing of rugby league legend\u00a0Kevin Sinfield is a statement of intent . He wants to play fly-half and while the prospect of him igniting the Championship at the age of 34 is far-fetched, he is a proven leader and winner, and his mentality is what the union side at Headingley are keen to tap into. No doubt, he\u2019ll bring a few more through the turnstiles, too, but coach Bryan Redpath will want him to provide inspiration to the rookies around him. It is a worthwhile roll of the dice and amid talk of an end to promotion and relegation, Leeds are another second-tier club demonstrating a desire to be upwardly mobile. Last Word . Team GB, under the auspices of England, face the growing threat of having to come through a qualifying competition this summer in order to reach the Olympic Sevens tournament in Rio. In Hong Kong last weekend, Simon Amor\u2019s side \u2013 nominated as the best prospect to qualify on behalf of Great Britain, ahead of Wales and Scotland \u2013 lost further ground to Australia and remain stuck in fifth place in the world rankings, one below the final qualification slot. This weekend in Tokyo, they must try to catch their rivals from Down Under, but they have been drawn in a pool with Fiji, who won in Hong Kong and are second in the rankings behind South Africa. Realistically, one Olympic place is up for grabs, behind those nations and New Zealand, and England\u2019s advantage is that the series culminates at Twickenham next month. Sadly, Team GB\u2019s preparations \u2013 complicated by the presence of separate home nations in rugby \u2013 have been marred by a chronic lack of clarity and foresight, and being forced to enter what amounts to a repechage event would be somehow fitting.",

Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of V\u00e1c in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Ter\u00e9zia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by \u2018new\u2019 diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of V\u00e1c's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria\u00a0Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second\u2013fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in\u00a0V\u00e1c in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'",

Shaun Andrew McKerry, 31, was arrested after he burst into\u00a0Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham wielding an axe and demanding cash, as an accomplice stood at the door. But he was foiled after shopkeeper Sab Dhillon heard McKarry's demands and ran from the back of the shop and rugby tackled him to the floor. Mr Dhillon's wife then appeared clutching her son's baseball bat and managed to subdue him further. Scroll down for video . Prolific thief Shaun Andrew McKerry was once dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' because he always returned home after his many crimes, and he has been unmasked as the axe wielding thief in an attempted post office robbery - where he was subdued by the owner who rugby tackled him and his wife with a baseball bat (left) McKerry was dubbed 'Boomerang Boy' in the 1990s after he was arrested\u00a080 times in 1995 and 45 times during the 36 weeks he managed to stay out of prison in 1998. He got his nickname because he always returned home after his crimes. He committed his first offence at the age of 11 and in the next five years went on to commit 1,000 crimes. His own mother even previously pleaded for her teenage son, known as a one man crime wave, to be locked up. McKerry pleaded guilty\u00a0at Durham Crown Court, via videolink from prison, to attempted robbery from the post office on March 15. CCTV footage of the incident shows the 31-year-old burst into the store and demand\u00a0terrified assistant Andrea Brighty fill his bag with money. But Mr Dhillon heard the incident and ran from the back of the store to pounce on McKerry. After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat. McKerry is pictured in handcuffs at the age of 15 when he was committing strings of offences in the area . As Mr Dhillon held him, the shop assistant removed McKerry's scarf so his face could be shown to the cameras. His accomplice, who had been standing guard at the door when they burst in, fled. Mrs Dhillon said: 'It was really scary. We didn't realise who he was at the time and how bad his previous convictions were.' Her husband told the Northern Echo: 'He did not hit me but there was a good chance that he could have as he was waving the axe about blindly while he was on the floor. Mr Dhillon said McKerry was waving the axe around when he jumped on him and wrestled him to the floor . 'I am OK and we're trying to get over it and we just want to put this behind us.' McKerry, who will be sentenced on April 24, is known by the nickname 'Boomerang Boy' or 'Homing Pigeon Boy' because he always returned home after his crimes. He once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. His catalogue of offending included car chases with police, a string of burglary convictions, aggravated vehicle taking, sending indecent letters, witness intimidation, threatening behaviour, assaulting a police officer, attempted robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and countless breaches of curfew, community sentences and offending while on bail. CCTV images show Mr Dhillon pouncing on 31-year-old McKerry, armed with an axe, from behind . Mr Dhillon and the terrified shop assistant (right) subdued McKerry and revealed his face for the cameras . Mr Dhillon tackled McKerry and both he and his wife said they did not realise his criminal history at the time . McKerry's case was even brought to the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair, who later announced a crackdown on so called 'bail-bandits'. He began offending from the age of 11, and has clocked up dozens of court appearances. On March 11, 1999, McKerry, of County Durham, had already been arrested five times between January 22 and February 10. Shaun Andrew McKerry started offending at the age of 11 when he committed his first theft in 1995. Between 1995 and 2000 he clocked up 1,000 offences. In the 12 months of 1995 he was arrested 80 times. McKerry managed to stay out of prison for 36 weeks in 1998, and was arrested 45 times. He was arrested five times between January 22 and February 10, 1999. McKerry became known as a one man crime wave and was dubbed Boomerang Boy because he always returned home, police knowing where to find him. His mother even called for her teenage son to be arrested. In 1999 she said: 'I love him as a son but I hate the person he has become.' In one of his earlier crimes McKerry  stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman. By the age of 15 McKerry had\u00a0convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. When he was 16 McKerry was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for\u00a0robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. At the age of 18 he was out of prison and had offended again, but was given a 'second chance' by magistrates. Just three days later he was back again. From then on he stuck to low level crimes to feed his drug habit. In 2011 he was jailed for four years after he admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. In March he was rugby tackled and restrained by Sab Dhillon when he went into the store, armed with an axe and demanded cash. He has 55 previous convictions. He boasted after one court appearance he would be back and returned just 48 hours later on suspicion of taking a car. The 15-year-old was then placed on a supervision order despite a report to magistrates that he was a danger to the public. Magistrates tried to provide him with a string of second chances and opportunities to rehabilitate himself - but each time he re-offended. In February 2000 the press won a landmark legal victory to name him when the Lord Chief Justice ruled Bishop Auckland Youth Court had done nothing legally wrong when it agreed to the paper's application to lift the juvenile's automatic right to anonymity. Lord Bingham said he had taken a great interest in the case which centred on the individual youth's right to freedom and anonymity against the public's right to be better protected by knowing his identity. As he continued to offend McKerry developed a drug problem and stole to feed his habit. Six months later McKerry, then 16, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution for robbing a village postmaster at knifepoint. This was later cut on appeal but by March 2002, aged 18, he was back behind bars again after admitting two new offences - three days after being given yet another 'last chance' by magistrates. McKerry had been granted bail after admitting theft on a Monday but was picked up 48 hours later after helping raid a Bishop Auckland clothing shop. In 2002 his mother Paula Harp, 32, pleaded for him to be arrested after she said he had ruined her life. She claimed he started to offend because he was a bit of a loner, and began doing minor things like throwing stones before his behaviour escalated. In recent years, much of his offending has been for the theft of low value items, from shops in the south-west Durham area. But in May, 2011 he was jailed for four years at Durham Crown Court which heard he only had 18 months to live if his drug and alcohol abuse continued. McKerry admitted robbery after stealing \u00a390 from a takeaway delivery man in Coundon while armed with a six inch kitchen knife. His lawyer said he had deep vein thrombosis and cirrhosis of the liver, as a result of years of substance abuse. The court heard he had 55 previous convictions for 120 offences.",

Murdered:\u00a0A University of Mary Washington student has been charged with abduction and murder in the death of his roommate, 20-year-old Grace Rebecca Mann of Falls Church (pictured) Charged: Steven Vander Briel, 30 (left), is accused of killing Mann (right), an active UMW junior, and fleeing the scene. He was arrested two hours later in a church parking lot. Mann is believed to have been asphyxiated . One of the women started to perform CPR as the other called 911. Mann\u00a0- the daughter of a juvenile and domestic relations court judge in Fairfax County - was rushed to Mary Washington Hospital, but pronounced dead shortly after arriving. A major manhunt was subsequently launched for Briel. A nearby school, James Monroe High School, was placed on lock-down as officers scoured the streets with police dogs. Just over two hours later, about 5.30pm, some officers saw Briel emerge from the woods near Riverside First Church of God on Fall Hill Avenue. He was arrested and taken in for questioning. Police have since charged Briel with first-degree murder and abduction. Scene:\u00a0Grace Rebecca Mann, 20, was found unconscious by two female roommates in a home on Washington Avenue about 3 p.m., Fredericksburg Police said. Four people lived at the home - Mann and Briel, and two other females that found Mann's body .

Accused: Police have charged Steven Vander Briel, 30, with first-degree murder and abduction in the death of Grace Rebecca Mann . Family: Grace Mann is the daughter of Thomas Mann, a juvenile and domestic relations court judge in Fairfax County, and Melissa Mann, local media reported . There was no known personal relationship between Mann and Briel, other than the fact they lived together,NBC Washington\u00a0reported. No motive has been released and the circumstances surrounding the death also remain unknown. Briel attended UMW from 2002 to 2007 and then re-enrolled for the spring 2015 semester as a political science major. Mann was a junior from Falls Church, Virginia. She was a history and American studies major. She also was an executive board member of Feminist United and recently appointed to the President\u2019s Task Force on Sexual Assault. She was also a member of the Student Government Association Senate. 'She was moving mountains,' one student, Theresa Buczek, wrote on Facebook.

Popular: Mann was an executive board member of Feminist United and recently appointed to the President\u2019s Task Force on Sexual Assault. As word spread around campus Friday, tributes started pouring in for Mann, who was described as determined and energetic. UMW Senior Paige McKinsey told NBC Washington that Mann was working towards becoming a lawyer. 'As an American Studies major, Grace focused her studies on the mass incarceration rates of underprivileged communities with hopes of becoming a lawyer to one day serve those communities,' McKinsey said.

David Hibbitt, 33, was diagnosed with the disease in July 2012 and underwent\u00a0chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery to remove his large bowel. Doctors told him the cancer was terminal - so he decided to try cannabis oil as a last resort and bought it from a local dealer for \u00a350 a gram. Now the father-of-one says he has been cancer-free since his last scan in January \u00a0- and puts the class-B drug down to his miracle recovery. David Hibbitt, 33, claims doctors said he had between 18 months and five years to live after being diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. In desperation, he tried cannabis oil, which he now credits with his recovery . He is now looking forward to the future after tying the knot with his partner of six years Heather Martin, 26, at a registry office today. Mr Hibbitt, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Friends had told me about cannabis oil and I dismissed it at first. I've never been into drugs. 'But in February last year I was told I only had 18 months to five years to live, and I felt I had to try everything I could. 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die.' After going online to research his options, he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it. 'I pay around \u00a350 for a gram from a bloke I know who makes it,' he said. 'That lasts me about a month usually. 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy. 'The pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job. 'I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there.' Mr Hibbitt was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer after initially being told he was suffering from piles. Mr Hibbitt, with fiance Heather, said: 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die' After undergoing treatment at the Christie Hospital, in Manchester, the cancer returned and he had another operation in July 2013 followed by more chemotherapy. He was given the all-clear before Christmas that year, but a month later he found a lump, and was told the cancer was in the lymph nodes in his groin. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn't good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'Researchers are collecting patients' experiences to build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabinoid-based drugs in order to gather solid data on whether they benefit people with cancer.' Mr Hibbitt, who works in advertising, added: 'This time they told me there wasn't a lot they could do. 'In July, after doing a lot of research, I got some cannabis oil. I was having chemo, and I was getting to a point where I couldn't really do much, I had no energy. 'In August I decided I'd had enough and I was going to stop the chemotherapy. In October, he had an operation to remove the affected lymph nodes at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. But he chose to carry on taking cannabis oil rather than have any more treatment, deciding against further chemotherapy sessions. Following a scan in January he was given the all-clear - paving the way for him to organise his wedding. Mr Hibbitt, who has a five-year-old son, Ashton, said: 'We never thought this would happen, it's great. Fingers crossed now I will grow old. 'I feel really good and I hope my story will help other people.' His fiance Heather, a nursery nurse, said: 'I didn't want him to take the cannabis oil at first because it's illegal, but I saw the change in him and slowly got used to it. 'He is a determined person and did a lot of research. He wanted to live. 'We are all amazed how well he's done. I can't see my life without him. We have come through a hell of a lot.' Describing the effects of cannabis oil, he said: 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy.The pain just seemed to disappear. I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there' Cancer Research UK says it is aware of patients using cannabis extracts to treat themselves but stressed there is 'no good evidence'  to prove it was safe and effective. The charity is supporting clinical trials into the use of the drug and a synthetic cannabinoid to treat the disease. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours.

Scroll down and you'll eventually find your first female face: none other than Barbie, 'CEO Barbie' to be precise, a doll which first appeared in the Eighties, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase. The image of Barbie is the 96th result on the page, and ironically comes from a 2005 spoof article courtesy of The Onion that jokingly states 'women don't run companies'. Spot the stereotype! Barbie is the 96th image to come up on Google Images when you enter the search term 'CEO', after rows and rows of grinning suit-clad men . Several high-powered women, including women's right campaigner Chelsea Clinton, have re-tweeted the results of the search, which is being seen by many as a sad reflection on the general state of women in the workplace. Google, like other search engines, generates images based on a knot of complex algorithms related to file names and key words. The more 'popular' and relevant an image is, the higher up the ranks it will move. After Barbie, the next female - and the first human one - you'll find upon searching Google Images for 'CEO' doesn't pop up until several lines more of men, and is Jessica Herrin, CEO of a jewellery company called Stella & Dot. Incidentally, a new study from the University of Washington recently found that results like these are indeed contributing to gender bias, and perpetuating outdated views on women in the workplace. Shining example? The image (pictured) is of 'CEO Barbie', a doll which first appeared in the 80s, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase . Noted: Chelsea Clinton was one of the many high-powered women to retweet the results of the search . The study concluded: 'Manipulated image search results could determine, on average, seven per cent of a study participant\u2019s subsequent opinion about how many men and women work in a particular field.' Earlier this year, it was determined by the Professional Boards Forum\u2019s BoardWatch that for the first time ever, the proportion of women on FTSE 500 boards in the UK had reached 20 per cent.

But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna\u2019s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair\u2019s popularity. Brookstein\u2019s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It\u2019s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair\u2019s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: \u2018Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.\u2019 Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned \u00a3303,000 in addition to his MP\u2019s salary, mostly from \u00a31,600-an-hour appearances on Iran\u2019s Press TV and Russia Today. The national treasure that is Andrew Marr gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign. \u2018There\u2019s this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life. To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,\u2019 he writes in The Spectator. \u2018They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don\u2019t want to talk about taxation. \u2018The deficit? Apparently if it\u2019s left alone it\u2019s just going to melt away. Huddled-down, risk-averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children.\u2019 Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's 'Controls On Immigration' mug embarrassing . Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour\u2019s embarrassing \u2018Controls On Immigration\u2019 mug at the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in her Sky News interview yesterday. Cooper coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras. \u2018A storm in a coffee cup,\u2019 Cooper, aka Mrs Ed Balls, said. The influential Labour Uncut blog says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon\u2019s claim that Red Ed Miliband \u2018stabbed his own brother in the back\u2019 to lead Labour, and would do the same to Britain by negotiating away Trident, will help the Tories. \u2018The manner in which Ed Miliband defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with Labour canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of Ed Miliband as an untrustworthy leader,\u2019 the website says. \u2018The gutter is an ugly place to be but. . . it\u2019s where elections are won.\u2019 Plaid Cymru is under pressure to dump its candidate for Ceredigion, Mike Parker, for saying in 2001 English-born inhabitants of rural Wales were \u2018gun-toting final solution crackpots\u2019.

The party was also reportedly attended by female students from several sororities. Photos from the party flooded social media and were accompanied by comments such as: 'Merry Cripmas to all, and all a hood night.' The Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity at Clemson University in South Carolina has been put on probation for two years after the group held a Christmas theme party that flared up racial tensions on campus . Clemson University president, James Clements (right), speaks with students protesting last December's frat party which caused outrage for its perpetuation of stereotypes . The party, organized by several SAE members, was held off-campus at a private residence. 'Cripmas' appeared to be a reference to a primarily African-American gang, The Crips, founded in California. The incident caused a backlash as black students protested and said Clemson didn't do enough to promote racial tolerance. About 6 percent of Clemson's students are black. All SAE activity was suspended by Clemson indefinitely following the inappropriate theme party. Several SAE members resigned from positions and have been suspended from the fraternity. An internal investigation found that the fraternity violated alcohol rules and student conduct codes. It will be on probation until February 2017. Clemson University president, James Clements, sent an email to students last December making clear that the party was not sanctioned by the university and that such events would not be tolerated. White students dressed in red and blue bandanas, T-shirts with images of the late rapper Tupac Shakur and sported fake 'thug' tattoos . Clements wrote: 'At a time of year when our thoughts are turning to family, holidays and the start of a new year \u2013 all the things that unite us and bring us joy -- it is discouraging that so many events and issues are causing division and hurt, and making many students feel unwanted at this great university. 'It hurts to read disrespectful and just plain mean comments in social media. Last night's ''Cripmas'' party, which the university did not sanction, raised more concerns about the campus climate. Clemson is better than this. He added: 'Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion about events in Ferguson, Staten Island and the protest rallies that those events have spawned. Great universities are built on the free expression and exploration of ideas. 'But the free expression of opinion must not cross the line and become harassment or intimidation, just as rallies and protest marches must not cross the line to lawlessness.' A Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was disbanded last month after members were taped singing a racist song.

Her food allergies change so frequently, keeping track is almost pointless. It was just another day with another massive allergic reaction. She can always tell when one is coming on. \"I just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom.\" Her labradoodle, Moose, starts alerting, licking her hands frantically. \"I'll feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach, and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling. And we have to treat it really fast.\" On that particular day in March, multiple EpiPens didn't slow the reaction. The paramedics who arrived to take Brynn to Greenville Memorial Hospital, or \"Hotel Greenville\" as she likes to call it, knew her well. When she asked for her security blanket, they knew to hand her her smartphone. \"New day, new crisis,\" Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong. It might as well be. When you're allergic to life, a near-death experience is no big deal. Less than a week after her trip to the hospital, Brynn, 21, is back at home in Easley, South Carolina. She lies on her back, her head near the foot of her bed, chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port. Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. The disinfectant burns, and Brynn's blood pressure hits 150/102. Her heart rate rockets to 128. \"The meds we have to give her to keep her alive, she reacts to,\" Melissa says, shaking her head. \"Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. \" Brynn was seemingly a normal kid -- until she wasn't. Yes, she was a fussy baby. Yes, she got sick often as a child, Melissa muses out loud -- but what kid doesn't? Brynn was also incredibly energetic, always the center of attention. Her father, Barry, jokingly rues the day she learned to talk. She started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11. That was the same year doctors diagnosed Brynn with IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. \"She's always been --\" Melissa Duncan pauses. \"High maintenance!\" Brynn fills in with a laugh. It wasn't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that Brynn had her first serious allergic reaction. The next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors' appointments. Brynn saw specialist after specialist. The gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis, or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles. A cardiologist said she had POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes, her blood pressure dropped, leaving her light-headed and nauseated. A Wake Forest doctor diagnosed her with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints. After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. They found a specialist online, Dr. Lawrence Afrin, who at the time was working in Charleston. They waited nearly nine months to see him, but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life-changing. Scientists don't know yet what causes mast cell disease. Researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior, but the mutations vary from one patient to the next. Because of this, scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life. But genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations. Mast cells are the regulators of your immune system. They're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites, or when you come into contact with an allergen. They basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong. Until recently, the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis, which is characterized by \"abnormal proliferation and activation\" of the body's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways. But in the last few years doctors such as Afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number. \"It's like I'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction,\" Brynn explains simply. Fruit, vegetables, milk, soy, nuts, smoke, perfume, the sun -- you name it, Brynn is allergic to it. But it's not really about the specifics; the allergens change depending on how \"angry\" her mast cells are that day, she says. On good days, she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes. On bad days, even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain. Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. \"Oh God, no,\" Afrin says when asked. \"No, no, no, no.\" But mast cells are located in your connective tissue, including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine. They can affect every system in the body, Afrin says, so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms Brynn experiences. You have to ask yourself, he says: \"Is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different, independent problems? Or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on?\" Of course, having a diagnosis didn't make living with mast cell disease any easier. In 2012, Brynn was admitted to the hospital 30 times. She started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful, violent muscle contractions that are \"scary to see and scary to experience.\" On multiple occasions, doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction.",

Tom Moffatt, 27, from Ashton-under-Lyne in Tameside, Greater Manchester, was meant to ink 'Riley' - the name of his four-year-old son - into his left arm.

The makeshift tattoo session took place in Mr Moffatt's living room with a \u00a370 ink gun bought online. The NHS worker was drunk at the time and said he now considers the inkwork a 'nightmare'. He said: 'I'd never picked up a tattoo gun in my life and I got told by my brother not to do, but I just didn't listen. 'Now, my family are always saying \"you're an idiot, Tom\" and there are plenty of jokes at my expense from my mates. I can't repeat what they say about it. 'I have to hide my arm when I go for interviews. Even Riley has started to notice and points at those tattoos and says \"daddy, I don't like those ones\". It's a nightmare.' Among his homegrown tattoos, Mr Moffatt also has a wonky cross on his forearm, which he drew just a few months after Riley's birth in 2012. He has just endured his second hour-long laser removal session in a bid to get rid of the botched needlework.

Painful: But because the ink has gone so deep, Mr Moffatt is unsure how many more sessions he needs to have . He said: 'I've got a long journey ahead of me to get them all off and I pressed it so deep in one that it's going to be very difficult to get it off.' Mr Moffatt, who also has a two-year-old daughter Kya with partner Rachael Higgins, 23, now wants to use his experience to highlight why people should not attempt to draw their own tattoos. He said: 'Once I've got them off, my job isn't done. We want to try and get a campaign going so people like me can't just go out and buy a gun with no questions asked. 'You shouldn't be able to go on the internet as a 15-year-old Joe Bloggs and buy one. I want to get the message out there that tattoos should only be done by professionals.' The owner of the Maria Patricia Tattoo Removals, where he is being treated, says Mr Moffatt's situation is a stark warning against the dangers of unregulated ink work. Maria said: 'There needs to be more regulation. People don't realise the dangers of the buying off tattoo guns and ink off the internet. 'Tom did just that and had to Google the instructions of how to use it. It might seem like a laugh with mates when you're drunk but it's not easy to fix the damage and people can be left with scarring if they're not careful. 'We're all for tattoos but people need to be aware they can wreck lives and make it difficult to get jobs.'

The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.",

The former Motherwell manager admitted being wowed by Murray Park in the days after he replaced Kenny McDowall. The club's \u00a312million training facility is a major improvement on the public pitches at Dalziel Park he was forced to make do with during his Steelmen stint. Stuart McCall insists he's loving life at Rangers despite losing heavily to Queen of the South . But along with the plush surroundings, McCall knows being manager of the Glasgow giants means he also has to cope with the kind of intense scrutiny levels he did not have to deal with at Fir Park. Not everyone is cut out for the strains of the job, as McDowall proved when he quit after posting just three wins from his 10-game spell as caretaker. The former Celtic youth coach found himself in charge just as the battle for power at Ibrox reached its bitterest point and at one stage admitted life at Rangers had 'taken its toll' on him. McCall has taken over a brighter picture following Dave King's boardroom victory and the 50-year-old former Light Blues midfielder seemed to shrug off the extra pressure during his first few weeks in charge as he led his side to three successive wins - including successes against Hearts and Hibs. Lewis Kidd (left) battles for the ball against Rangers' David Templeton in Queen of the South's victory . But the focus will have sharpened since Gers suffered their first defeat under his watch when they lost 3-0 to Queen of the South on Thursday.

He said: 'I've not really noticed a difference in intensity levels. I just love what I do out there on the training field. 'At this moment in time I don't feel any pressure whatsoever. Ian Black (left) and Kris Boyd in training as Rangers look to get back to winning ways and gain promotion .

She achieved notoriety in January when a picture of her grasping a modified M4 assault rifle with an innocent smile on her face began circulating on social media. Scroll down for video . Joselyn Alejandra Ni\u00f1o is believed to have been found stuffed in a beer cooler just over the Mexican border last Sunday. She gained notoriety in January when this picture began circulating online . The woman, who looks like she is in her late teens or early 20s, began operating under the name Rio Bravo. Cutting a slim physique and an almost innocent smile, she also donned a Kevlar jacket beneath a gold necklace. In the comments next to the striking image, people urged her to sell the gun and buy another TV while others prayed for her. A picture of her body laying next to a dead man and another woman was taken before another image was posted showing her dismembered body in the cooler. A tattoo saying 'Nino', the same as the one seen on her right forearm, is also seen in the cooler. Alongside the photo was a message warning people to 'keep sending theses f****** a*** holes', insisting they will meet the same fate. Her two predecessors also ran into bad luck during confrontations with law enforcement. The first of the three 'Skinny Girls' was Veronica Mireya Moreno. According to The Daily Beast she started out as a police officer and became a hero when she was wounded during a shootout. The first of the three 'Skinny Girls' was Veronica Mireya Moreno. She was arrested driving a stolen car with a revolver and six cellphones inside and was accused of being complicit in a number of murders and drug deals in 2011 . On Saturday violence erupted on the U.S border after security forces arrested one of the area's most influential drug dealers . She is then alleged to have signed with the Los Zetas cartel and was arrested in 2011 while driving a stolen car - with a revolver and six cellphones inside. She was subsequently arrested and charged with being complicit in a number of murders and drug deals. Months later Nancy Manriquez Quintanar was said to have taken part in a string of slayings, mainly from competing cartels. More than 100,000 people have died in gang-related violence in Mexico over the past eight years.

According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege. A 24-year-old supermarket employee, Malian-born Lassana Bathily, was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from Coulibaly in the cold room. The hostage-taking was the culmination of three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The two brothers blamed for that attack, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed on January 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site. The terror attacks claimed the lives of 17 people and put France on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Ariana Williams reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

On Thursday, the Inverness defender was cleared to play in the Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk on May 30 after a charge of deliberate handball to deny Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths in last Sunday\u2019s semi-final was thrown out. In the aftermath of the 3-2 extra-time win, Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . His admission \u2013 backed by manager John Hughes \u2013 preceded the player being cited by the SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. That unprecedented move following a game in which a handball incident had gone unpunished, brought a warning from Jim Boyce, head of FIFA\u2019s referees committee, that a successful prosecution would open up a can of worms. Although such a scenario was avoided with the charge being kicked out, the furore surrounding the issue prompted the SFA go public on Friday with the tribunal panel\u2019s reasons. And it seems they accepted the preliminary argument of Inverness\u2019 legal representative that they weren\u2019t entitled to take the matter further. A statement read: \u2018Further to the judicial panel hearing on Friday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings\u2019 solicitor. \u2018In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . \u2018The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. \u2018It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.\u2019 The explanation raises questions as to whether McGlennan ought to have cited Meekings in the first place. Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded against Celtic . However, legal sources have told Sportsmail that the SFA\u2019s prosecutor is entitled to cite players even in such instances when officials have seen an \u2018incident\u2019 but have failed to spot an \u2018offence\u2019. Yet it appears that in Meekings\u2019 case, the panel concurred with his solicitor\u2019s argument that they were not entitled to take the matter further as the match officials had seen the incident. The matter is further confused by the fact that former Hearts striker Ryan Stevenson and ex-Motherwell keeper Darren Randolph were previously banned retrospectively for serious foul play as the referees in question had seen the \u2018incidents\u2019 but missed the \u2018offences\u2019 in question.",

The mobile X-ray scanner, heralded as the world\u2019s first \u2018airplane scanner\u2019, sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside. While the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated, the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety. Scroll down for video . Romanian company MB Telecom has revealed the Roboscan 2M Aeria. It uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes (shown) and look inside. The device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb. But the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet . The Roboscan 2M Aeria is being developed by Romanian company\u00a0MB Telecom (MBT). It costs \u20ac3 million (\u00a32.1 million, $3.2 million), reported\u00a0The Times, and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in Eastern Europe, where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes. On its website, MBT says the Aeria is \u2018the very first solution for aircraft security inspection.\u2019 It can scan planes from small private jets to medium-sized commercial airplanes. The company notes that, while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports, there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security. But with their device, the company says this \u2018gap\u2019 in aviation security can be plugged, and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes. The device can be used to detect weapons (shown) and other contraband in small or medium-sized jets that land at low-security airports . An operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane, although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted . There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. The first is the operating truck, from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane. Attached to this is a robotic arm with an X-ray generator at the end. The plane is then pulled forwards by a battery-operated tug over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane. The operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane, and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items. It is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb. One issue, though, is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits, even though Roboscan can examine these areas. \u2018You cannot touch it, but you can scan it,\u2019 said Radu Tudor of MBT at the Counter Terror Expo in London this week. There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. The first is the operating truck (shown), from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane .

But with the cost of maintenance and repairs to damaged public housing nearing $13 million a year in NSW alone, the State Government has had enough and is planning to make tenants pay a bond before they move in. Communities Minister Brad Hazzard said it was a 'very likely possibility' the plan would be implemented in the near future. 'The critical argument for it is that at the moment the maintenance costs, including damage from poor tenancy, are in the order of approximately $12-13 million per year,' Mr Hazzard told Daily Mail Australia. A picture from the NSW Department of Family and Community Services shows damage to public housing . Public housing tenants will  pay a bond under a NSW government plan to recoup losses from trashed properties . The state's new Community Services Minister Brad Hazzard said the annual bill for repairs and maintenance on taxpayer-funded housing had hit $12 million . Mr Hazzard added that he was unsure as to why public housing tenants have never been made to pay a bond similar to that paid by private renters . 'I'd like to see at least a reasonable portion of that money saved and put into more public housing. We have very long public housing tenancy waiting lists.' Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the fact public housing tenants don't pay a bond when consulting with workers in the field. He added that introducing a bond was not a new idea or 'rocket science'. 'My job is to make sure I use taxpayers money very wisely and maximise the opportunities for public housing for other people that wait years,' Mr Hazzard said. The Minister\u00a0said it would most likely be a one month bond, paid off over six months to a year. He said it would be possible to make exceptions in certain circumstance \u2013 for example women escaping domestic violence. Mr Hazzard added public housing tenants were already liable for damage but 'they don't have the money'. Pictured is a trashed public housing property in Hornsby, in the northern suburbs of Sydney . Mr Hazzard, who took over the portfolio after the March election, said he was alerted to the issue when consulting with workers in the field . Damage can also be seen to the garage door, and the backyard is piled up with junk . 'Generally it's very hard to retrospectively try to get money from tenants when they've moved out,' he said. 'This is about sending a forward message, a very clear and upfront message, that you will be responsible for the damage.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties. 'Tenants are always liable for the damage they cause, the question of the bond is really just about making sure there's a little bit of money there so landlords can have ready access to money,' Mr Cutcher said. 'I don't think the government should be looking at that in the same way as private landlord, who might struggle to cover costs. 'The government landlord isn't going to find themselves in a situation where they're going to be short of cash.' Mr Cutcher added that damage was often unfairly attributed to tenants. Green mouldy bread and stacks of filthy dishes seen piling up in the kitchen that hasn't been cleaned . Mr Hazzard said the bond would be able to be paid in instalments. 'They may not have the money to pay it in one hit, that's understandable,' he said . 'Some of those photos indicate something else is going on, properties are being vandalised it's not just people not looking after their properties,' he said. 'Tenants are usually very happy to have a social housing property, something they can afford, and it sure beats homelessness so they'll look after it on the whole. 'Problems occur when properties are left vacant for too long, and that's not an issue that can be solved by hitting tenants up for more money.' Mr Cutcher added: 'Households who are entering social housing tenancy are facing a number of challenges, and one of those challenges is necessarily a financial one. 'And to place an additional financial burden on people under those circumstances should be a difficult decision for a minister to make.' Ned Cutcher, policy officer at the NSW Tenants' Union, said public housing tenants were already liable if they caused damage to properties . Mr Cutcher added that damage was often unfairly attributed to tenants, when houses were sometimes vandalised or left vacant for long periods of time . 'Some of those photos indicate something else is going on, properties are being vandalised it's not just people not looking after their properties,' he said .",

The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who founded popular lifestyle wesbite Goop, posted a picture of her $29 grocery shop on her Twitter\u00a0account yesterday afternoon, showcasing a range of healthy options, including a variety of fresh vegetables, some brown rice and some black beans. 'This is what $29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week,' she wrote alongside the image. Food-focused: Actress-turned-lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow will be living off $29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks . Alexander Wang Satin Blazer . Shop the brand at Net-A-Porter . Visit site . A good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe. But add a touch of satin to it like Gwyneth Paltrow in her Alexander Wang version, and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye. The Goop creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath. The silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend. Gwyneth's threads are from a few seasons back, so it's no longer available in stores. But our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from Missguided to Forever 21.

Forever 21 Metallic Satin Blazer . Visit site . Missguided Satin Lapel Longline Tuxedo Blazer (now $30) Visit site . Stella McCartney Rhea satin blazer at The Outnet (now $784) Visit site . Unsurprisingly, although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper, yet more unhealthy, food options, lifestyle guru Gwyneth opted to stick to what she knows best, choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge. It looks as though Gwyneth might be going for a Mexican theme on at least one of the days of the challenge, including gluten-free tortillas, black beans, and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy Mexican-inspired feast. In a second tweet posted yesterday, she said of the challenge: 'We're walking in their shoes to see how far we get.' She then proceeded to nominate popular American chef Roy Choi, tagging him \u00a0by his Twitter username @RidingShotgunLA. Gwyneth also encouraged her fans to head over to the Food Bank NYC\u00a0website, take up the challenge themselves, and donate to the cause. There are those, however, who are already criticizing Gwyneth's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like; although the actress has vowed to live on just $29 for the week, many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person. Weekly haul: The 42-year-old actress posted this image of her grocery shop, which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items . Challenge: Gwyneth took to Twitter to share the news about her charity challenge . Writer Rebecca Vipond Brink from The Frisky, highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in Gwyneth's food choices, suggesting that those people living on SNAP benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day-to-day lives. 'I know other people are critiquing this already, but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant (sic),' Rebecca wrote. 'Nutritionally speaking, this is a vitamin bonanza. 'But people who live on SNAP benefits don\u2019t just have to get nutrients, they have to get actual calories, because they tend to have very physical lives, doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth.' According to The Frisky, the food in Gwyneth's Twitter post contains a total of\u00a07,059 calories, which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week-long challenge. That is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the American Heart Association. Friends together: Gwyneth was nominated to take on the week-long challenge by celebrity chef Mario Batali (pictured together in April 2013) Family ties: It is not known whether Gwyneth's children with ex-husband Chris Martin - Apple, ten, and Moses, nine (pictured) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother . Many people have also queried why Gwyneth might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge, suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes, or other filling carbohydrate options. For example, Safeway - where Gwyneth appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each, which adds up to $4.20 for seven. Had Gwyneth chosen a more substantial menu item, she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $1 - for less than the price of her limes. Gwyneth's decision to take on the $29-per-week challenge comes less than a month after she told CNN Money that she considers herself to be 'incredibly close to the common woman'. 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers,' she said in an interview. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life.\u00a0I think that's all women.' Gwyneth was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend, celebrity chef\u00a0Mario Batali, who is a member of the\u00a0Food Bank for New York City board, and also challenged singers Sting and Blondie to take part in the week-long trial. According to the Food Bank NYC website, the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry, while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face. 'Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,' the food bank's fundraising page explains. 'New Yorkers can't afford any cuts to Food Stamps\u2026The #FoodBankNYCChallenge raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget.' It is not known whether Gywneth's two children with ex-husband Chris Martin, Apple, ten, and Moses, nine, will also be taking part in the challenge however, given the limited supply of food featured in her Twitter picture, it is thought the Shakespeare in Love star is going it alone this time around.",

Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, had spent his entire life in foster care after\u00a0his mother gave birth to him behind bars. Three years after his emotional plea at St Mark Missionary Baptist Church in St Petersburg he has finally found a permanent home with the woman who first met him as a seven-year-old when she became his caseworker. Scroll down for video . Davion Only, 16, who captured hearts in 2013 when he made a plea for a\u00a0family to 'love him forever', has been adopted by his old caseworker Connie Bell Going (right) and her family . Davion plays on the Xbox in his bedroom with his soon-to-be adopted mom Connie sitting behind him together with her daughter Carley, 17, and her adopted son, Taylor, 14 . Throughout Davion's search for a family, and his years in the system, Connie Bell Going, had been by his side. On April 22 she will officially become Davion's mother.\u00a0She admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it. Since August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14. Then in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. Since then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges. 'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told\u00a0the\u00a0Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' Davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.' He then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.' Davion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker,\u00a0Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire life . Davion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a\u00a0family to 'love him forever' Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'. Millions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family. That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system. After Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months. 'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said. Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida. Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year. Davion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's children . Going says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone. Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy. 'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said.\u00a0'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?' For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear. The 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier. From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor. Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last July . Davion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their\u00a0birthdays,\u00a0which\u00a0fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his\u00a0three\u00a0siblings\u00a0and signed the court papers. After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well. 'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion (above in 2013) said to Going last December .",

American expat Brad Reynolds has become the travel website\u2019s top contributor, writing more than 3,300 reviews and uploading nearly 40,000 photos in just five years. The 38-year-old critiques every hotel, restaurant and landmark he visits on holiday and in his current home of Hong Kong, providing opinion and travel tips that have been read by millions of travellers around the world. Scroll down for video . Brad Reynolds, pictured at India's Taj Mahal, is TripAdvisor's most active user with 66,000 contributions in just five years . The 38-year-old, who now lives in Hong Kong, gave a five-star review of 'amazing' Pushkar, India after attending its camel fair . Originally from Edmond, Oklahoma, Brad and his wife, Jill, are avid travellers \u2013 taking about four \u2018sizeable\u2019 trips every year, in addition to weekend trips to places such as Macau. Posting under the username BradJill, Brad averages nearly two reviews a day and has made more than 66,000 contributions to the website, including 3,355 reviews, 21,000 forum posts and seven videos. He has posted reviews from 394 cities and 46 countries, with a map on his TripAdvisor profile claiming he has travelled more than 600,000 miles and visited a third of the world. A good number of his reviews have been written for attractions in Hong Kong, Macau and London, where Brad and Jill lived for a few years before moving to Asia. Russia is one of the roughly 80 countries the Oklahoma native has visited (pictured: Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia) Brad Reynolds had nothing but good things to write after visiting this Three Rondavels viewing platform in South Africa . Writing critiques has become an almost daily hobby for Brad, with each one taking anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete. While some people collect stamps or create scrapbooks, he gets his kicks from helping fellow travellers and preserving his travel memories. Brad, a director at an English language learning centre, told MailOnline Travel: \u2018We were just like most people and we just lurked on the website for several years before signing up. \u2018Travel is a very important hobby for us and we spend a lot of time researching and we take a lot of notes. When I get back and start writing reviews it becomes more of a daily habit. \u2018Part of reviewing is a little bit selfish for me. I like recording my travel memories. I used to do a travel journal, but that has been replaced by reviews. \u2018What I\u2019m hoping to accomplish with the community is to try to put notes together that help people to make informed decisions on their own to determine if they want to see certain things or eat at a certain restaurant.\u2019 So far Brad Reynolds has given just 12 one-star ('terrible') ratings, and he has handed out five-star reviews to top attractions . Brad, pictured at New Zealand's Franz Josef Glacier, writes an average of nearly two reviews a day, spending up to an hour on each one . This map on Brad Reynolds' TripAdvisor profile claims he has visited 34 per cent of the world and travelled more than 600,000 miles . So far he has given just 12 one-star ('terrible') ratings, including a caf\u00e9 in Thames, New Zealand, which served a \u2018very bad milkshake\u2019 and a Hong Kong burger joint that made a \u2018terrible hamburger served at premium prices\u2019. Brad wrote that the thick chocolate milkshake, priced at NZ$4.50, at Bayon Expresso was 'the single worst milkshake I can remember', describing the 'disgusting' concoction  as a \u2018highly liquid and odd-textured drink\u2019 that was \u2018the polar opposite of thick\u2019. He was just as unforgiving with his review of the HK$100 burger at The Butchers Club, writing that the fast-food favourite was \u2018a disaster\u2019 thanks to a patty that was \u2018devoid of any natural beef juice or flavour\u2019 and \u2018terrible ingredients\u2019. Some of his two-star ('poor') reviews include Speakers' Corner at London's Hyde Park (asking in his review 'How long will places like this remain relevant in the future?') and the New York Stock Exchange ('Have a look at the facade and side entrance and move along'). Brad and Jill are deeply passionate about travelling the world and say they go on holiday 'as much as humanly possible' Writing critiques has become an almost daily hobby for Brad, with each one taking anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to complete . But Brad has handed out plenty of five-star ratings for everything from London's Tower Bridge and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC to the Berlin Philharmonic and Budapest's Liberty Bridge. And no destination or cafe is off-limits. He has written reviews for a Nando's in London, a Starbucks in Hong Kong and a McDonald's in Dubai, which he gave a 'poor' rating, writing that his Sausage Egg McMuffin was 'quite poor in food quality, even by McDonald\u2019s international standards'. Brad joined TripAdvisor in 2009, but didn\u2019t write his first review until 2010 when he and Jill, a doctor, were touring Saint Petersburg, Russia and were motivated to write a positive review after eating a \u2018delicious\u2019 slice of cheesecake at a restaurant. Despite devoting countless hours to his reviews he hasn\u2019t developed any fatigue. He said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible, but isn\u2019t afraid to give a one-star rating if the hotel, restaurant or attraction wasn\u2019t up to snuff. He also doesn\u2019t regret any of the things he has written, adding: \u2018We don\u2019t do a lot of cheerleading and we try to keep the emotions out of the reviews. Brad estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on the couple's recent two-week holiday in Italy . Brad and his wife, Jill, have travelled to exotic destinations around the world, including\u00a0rice terraces outside Sagada, Philippines . \u2018When I write a review I try to be more objective and informative and highlight the things that will be more important to the people who will visit. \u2018There are times when things fail to meet the expectations I might have of them but I don\u2019t tend to slam them unless it\u2019s a very, very bad experience.\u2019 This spring the couple toured Italy, stopping in Rome, Florence and Venice during their two-week holiday. Brad, who has visited about 80 countries and has lived in Hong Kong for nine years, estimates that he will write as many as 150 reviews based on their experiences at hotels, restaurants, museums, churches and piazzas in Italy. Despite devoting countless hours to his reviews Brad isn't fatigued; he said he tries to make his reviews as informative as possible . The number of reviews he writes ultimately depends on the destination. If it\u2019s a big city, he will likely have dozens of places to write about. But when they visited a game reserve in South Africa the review count was low. Brad doesn\u2019t pay much attention to the word count, as the length of each review varies. He said: \u2018If it\u2019s a museum like the British Museum it\u2019s going to be longer with tips and advice for other visitors. If we\u2019re visiting a small pizzeria in Rome the review won\u2019t be so long.\u2019 Brad Reynolds said he used to spend a lot of time writing about his travels in journals, but now writes reviews to preserve his memories .",

He was so big that it took Shepherd John Hendy and a team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, who they've now named Big Ben. Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him, all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs. Big Ben: the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of the average new-born, towering over peers . Proud mum: Jean with huge son Big Ben after a three-hour labour at a Leicestershire farm . Ben isn't the biggest lamb ever born in this country but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered. 'I don't think there was anything unusual about either parent and this is the first time we have bred a lamb as large as this,' she said. 'His mother must have been relieved when it was over.' She added that the farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock. 'This year we had 86 ewes to lamb but no-one expected anyone like him,' she said. 'We are thinking about keeping him as a tup - a breeding ram - to see if he passes on his weight to the lambs he sires.' Almost as big as a person: Ben dwarfs the other 86 ewes born at the same farm this season . Ben's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the UK weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north Wales. He was named The Big One and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild. Last year Goliath was born at a hefty 22lbs 5oz in Wellington in Somerset. The title for the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb was Bruno, nicknamed 'Woooly Lamboth', who was born in Worcestershire in 2009 at a healthy 21lbs. Bruno was spared the chop because of his size as his owner decided to keep him as a pet because he was curious to know just how big he would get. New Zealand is the world's biggest producer of lambs. But the largest new-born lamb ever recorded there weighed just 15.5lbs.",

Despite the duo's dominance, Benzema is adamant he can compete for the title if he continues to perform for Real Madrid and at international level. 'If I keep winning titles then I can win this award in future,' he told Le Parisien. 'We have Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, the two best players. We know I won't reach 80 or 100 goals in a season. They can do that.' Benzema (right) has scored 20 goals, in all competitions, for Real Madrid this season .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nGoogle Wallet says it has changed its policy when storing users' funds as they will now be federally-insured (file photo) For those who use Google Wallet, their money just became safer with federal-level insurance. Google confirmed to\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service (similar to PayPal and Venmo) in multiple federally-insured banking institutions. This is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their Wallet Balance because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000. Currently, Google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the FDIC. However, a Google spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the current policy has changed. The policy states that 'funds held by Google Payment Corp. or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Payment Transactions are not deposit obligations of Buyer, and\u00a0are not insured for the benefit of Buyer by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency', according to\u00a09to5. As a non-banking institution, Google Wallet, along with PayPal and Venmo, is not legally required to be federally insured. But with the new change to its policy, funds in Wallet Balance are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy. For example, for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not FDIC insured, if a company files for bankruptcy, the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back. But for users with FDIC insurance, they would receive their money from the government in a matter of days, according to Yahoo Finance. Details on when Google Wallet's user agreement will be updated were not provided. How Google Wallet works: . Google Wallet, launched in 2011, stores credit and debit card information, and lets shoppers pay for goods by tapping their phones against special terminals at store checkout counters. It works with any debit or credit card, on every mobile carrier. The service allows users to send money to anyone in the US with a Gmail address, or request money on-the-go, directly from their bank account, debit card or Wallet Balance. Users can spend received money through the service in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs with the Google Wallet Card, as well as transfer the funds directly to their bank account. It comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring, and users can disable their Wallet app or card from their Google Wallet account if they're ever lost or stolen. Source: Google Wallet . Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected Google Inc's request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the technology company of invading the privacy of users of its Google Wallet electronic payment service by sharing their personal information with outside app developers. The judge said Google must face claims it breached users' contracts, violated the federal Stored Communications Act which limits disclosure of electronic records, and violated a California consumer protection law. Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California said Google Wallet users may try to show that Google 'frustrated' the purpose of its own privacy policy by allowing 'blanket, universal disclosure' of their personal information to app developers whenever they bought apps in Google's Play Store. The lead plaintiff is Alice Svenson, an Illinois resident who said Google sent unnecessary personal information about her to YCDroid when she paid that developer $1.77 for an email app. She said Google raised the risk of identity theft by routinely sending information about Google Wallet users such as addresses and zip codes, phone numbers and email addresses to app developers. Svenson said the Mountain View, California-based company ceased the practice soon after the lawsuit was filed in September 2013. Her lawsuit seeks class-action status, damages of $1,000 per violation, punitive damages and other remedies.",

The picture, taken by a person who claims to be a student at Geelong College, south-west of Melbourne, is believed to show disgraced principal Andrew Barr surfing for pornography while on-the-clock. In the picture taken through a window, the man has his back to the camera and graphic images can be seen on his computer screen. Mr Barr resigned from his position at The Geelong College after an investigation, which included a search of his computer, after the photograph appeared on Snapchat. This is the photograph circulating on social media that is believed to show principal Andrew Barr watching pornography in his office at Geelong College . Daily Mail Australia contacted the school to verify the image is of Mr Barr but it was not willing to comment further. Chairman of the Geelong College council, Dr Hugh Seward, told the Geelong Advertiser\u00a0last week the matter was a serious breach of the school's standards, even if the investigation found Mr Barr not to have broken any law. 'The matter was taken very seriously,' Dr Seward said. 'Just before Easter, The Geelong College council became aware of a matter of concern that might constitute a breach of our standards.' 'The council immediately looked into the matter and when our concerns were confirmed, Andrew Barr tendered his resignation.' Mr Barr resigned after a student at The Geelong College took the picture of him and shared it with other students using the photosharing app, Snapchat . In a statement, Dr Seward thanked Mr Barr for his contribution to the school since he joined the college in 2013. \u2018In the two years since his appointment, Mr Barr has made an enduring contribution to the College\u2019s educational vision and future planning. The Council is grateful for Mr Barr\u2019s commitment and achievement,' he said. Mr Barr is a former chairman of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and previously served 10 years as principal of Scotch Oakburn College in Melbourne. Dr Seward told the Geelong Advertiser the investigation confirmed Mr Barr had not broken any law and 'at no point' did his actions affect the care provided to students. The Geelong College Council has since announced it has begun searching for a new Principal. Chairman of the Geelong College council, Dr Hugh Seward said the incident was a serious breach of\u00a0the school's standards .",

Superior court Judge Susan Garsh punished Robert Cusanelli of WHDH-TV after two jurors told the court they were trailed by a van as they tried to get into their cars on Wednesday. 'He cannot come into this building or be driving a WHDH vehicle for the purpose of doing reporting work on this case,' Garsh said from the bench after Cusanelli testified under oath. Two jurors informed the court Thursday morning that they saw someone watching them in a Ford Explorer. One took a picture of its license plate. Two jurors from the Aaron Hernandez (pictured in court on Thursday) murder trial told the court they were followed by a TV van as they made their way home in Boston . Robert Cusanelli of Boston's WHDH-TV was banned from the Bristol County courthouse and was told he was not allowed to drive a vehicle for the 'purpose of reporting this case' Cusanelli acknowledged that he followed the jurors, saying he made the decision to do so on his own to find out where jurors were parking. He said he didn't talk to the jurors, didn't take their picture or write down their license plate numbers and at the time thought he wasn't doing anything wrong. 'I see now that it was a mistake,' he said. The van was allegedly behind the jury bus as it headed towards an off-site parking lot where the jurors are dropped off at the end of the day. After learning of the allegations, Garsh called the former New England Patriot player and his lawyers up to have a private discussion at the bench after they arrived in court on Thursday morning. According to WCVB, she said the incident could have resulted in mistrial. According to the Boston Globe, both the jurors are remaining on the panel. 'We're at a stage of this case where it is obviously both vital and legally required that absolutely no juror be approached or questioned or followed in any fashion,' Garsh said at the time. 'It is the court's view that there have to be consequences for that.' Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh has warned the TV station there could be repercussions following the incident that was reported in court on Thursday . The station was told to 'investigate' the matter before reporting back to the court. The 12 jurors spent a combined nine hours deliberating on Tuesday and Wednesday. They continued deliberating after the judge questioned the jurors involved and spoke to the attorney but did not reach a verdict on Thursday. They will return on Friday as Hernandez awaits his fate. Hernandez is charged with the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fianc\u00e9e's sister. Lloyd was shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Jurors must deliberate every day from 9am to 4:30 pm., and may go later if they wish. On Wednesday they asked the judge for clarification on weapon and ammunition possession charges Hernandez faces. The judge brought the jury in Wednesday afternoon after receiving two questions about the possession charges. Hernandez is charged with illegally possessing a .45-caliber handgun and .22-caliber ammunition. The former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez speaks to defense attorney Charles Rankin in the courtroom of the Bristol County Superior Court House on April 8, 2015. The jury are now deliberating . Two friends of Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, are also charged with murder and will be tried separately. Prosecutors contend that the three men, in the early hours of June 17, 2013, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston and drove him to the industrial park where his body was found riddled with bullets later that day. During the trial, which began in January and featured more than 130 witnesses, prosecutors showed video footage of Hernandez coming and going from his home around the time of Lloyd's death. Investigators did not recover the gun that was used to shoot Lloyd, a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Hernandez faces a charge of murder and two firearms-related violations. If convicted of first-degree murder, he would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A second-degree murder conviction would lead to a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Hernandez had been a rising star in the National Football League with a $41 million contract when he was arrested on June 26, 2013. The Patriots dropped him within hours.",

Virginia Roberts had hoped to join a lawsuit involving Andrew\u2019s friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile and sex offender. But last night Judge Kenneth Marra ordered her claims that she was a \u2018sex slave\u2019 to Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times should be \u2018struck from the record\u2019. Scroll down for video . Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. Her claims she was forced to sleep with him have now been struck from the court record . Prince Andrew pictured leaving an Easter service at Windsor Castle on Sunday. The judge ruled the details of the accusations against him had no bearing on the reopening of the lawsuit against Epstein . The judge refused to make a statement regarding the veracity of Miss Roberts\u2019s allegations, but issued an order that the \u2018lurid\u2019 and \u2018unnecessary\u2019 claims should not be involved in the Epstein case. \u2018At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\u2019 Prince Andrew is not mentioned by name in the ten-page ruling, made in the Palm Beach County court, Florida. But Judge Marra refers to the powerful people Miss Roberts was allegedly forced to have sex with by Epstein. Her claims of taking part in an orgy with the Duke and sleeping with him on two other occasions when she was 17 \u2013 below the age of consent in Florida \u2013 were described as \u2018immaterial and impertinent\u2019. In 17 words, the judge may have drawn a line under a controversy that has dogged Prince Andrew since January. Miss Roberts, referred to as \u2018Jane Doe 3\u2019 in court papers, and another woman were hoping to join two other alleged victims of Epstein in suing the U.S. government over a plea deal prosecutors struck with the financier. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave' But Judge Marra ruled yesterday that the Jane Doe 3 and 4 applications should be denied and it was therefore \u2018unnecessary\u2019 for them to be added as plaintiffs. When the court claim surfaced earlier this year, Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace refused to go into any details regarding the accusations. However, in late January he briefly referred to the allegations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying he wanted to \u2018reiterate and reaffirm\u2019 palace statements that insisted he never had any sexual contact or relationship with Miss Roberts. She has repeatedly claimed she had sex three times with Andrew when she was 17 \u2013 a claim he emphatically denies \u2013 and served papers on him via the British Embassy in Washington DC. But they were returned to sender. Her legal team\u2019s bid to serve papers on the Duke came after courier FedEx returned a similar letter as it was \u2018refused\u2019 by the recipient at Buckingham Palace. The court papers lodged in Florida accused Andrew of abusing Miss Roberts when she was 17. She claimed that under the orders of paedophile Epstein she was \u2018forced\u2019 to have sex with the prince three times in 2001 \u2013 in London, New York and on Epstein\u2019s Caribbean island. The 55-year-old royal was so concerned about the allegations that he consulted top criminal QC William Clegg. Andrew\u2019s long friendship with Epstein was said to include lavish parties and exotic holidays, but it raised questions over the prince\u2019s choice of friends. He was introduced to the billionaire by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell. The fifth in line to the throne was forced to effectively cool, but not end, the friendship when sex claims were made against the financier. In June 2008, Epstein began serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence after pleading guilty to soliciting a girl, 14, for prostitution. Andrew was summoned by the Queen after pictures emerged of him in New York with Epstein in February 2011, after the financier had been released from prison. It emerged Epstein had given Andrew\u2019s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson \u00a315,000 to help reduce her debts. Last night Buckingham Palace declined to comment. The Duke was not a party to the court action and was not given the opportunity to rebut the allegations through the court. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Of course, he is paid to believe but there is some logic to his positivity when you consider how Manchester City won the league in 2012 and 2014 with late dramatic runs. \u2018It\u2019s kind of how we do it,\u2019 said Hart, when asked about City\u2019s need to overcome a nine-point deficit. \u2018We like to do it a different way. We\u2019ve not necessarily reached the standard week-in, week-out that we wanted to, but the beauty of football is that you get another chance and that starts on Monday at Crystal Palace. \u2018We\u2019ve got some massive games; eight big games to reach a level that we need to reach. We\u2019ve not necessarily done that all season but we feel we are in the right place now. We have a lot of rest time and there are no excuses. Everyone is fit and ready to go. We will never give up.\u2019 Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart insists his side are still capable of winning the Premier League title . Chelsea are nine points clear of Manchester City with both teams having eight games left to play . Chelsea are nine points clear of Manchester City . Hart is a good cheerleader. Last week he won his 50th cap at the age of 27 and was immensely proud of his achievement. And his club may need his leadership now. At the Etihad Stadium two weeks ago there was a distinct lack of fervour despite the 3-0 win over West Brom, as though a certain kind of resignation has set in regarding Manchester City\u2019s trajectory but Hart does not accept that. \u2018We\u2019ve proved it and the fans have proved it \u2013 we never give up,\u2019 he said. \u2018That is one thing that is part of Manchester City that we\u2019ve taken with us from the olden days. We\u2019ll never give up while anything is possible. We\u2019ll go for it. \u2018We have definitely moved on as a team since we first won the league in 2012. That was a massive achievement but now we expect it of ourselves. We have been disappointed at certain times this season but there are eight games to go and we\u2019ll give it all we\u2019ve got.\u2019 Hart himself is a good example of the adage that one should never give in. Dropped last season by Manuel Pellegrini and threatened this season by the \u00a36million signing of Willy Caballero, Hart is playing as well as ever, his penalty save against Lionel Messi and the subsequent performance at the Nou Camp a product of a long period of good form. Hart has proven his class after being dropped last season following a handful of mistakes . \u2018I feel pushed,\u2019 said Hart. \u2018I have personal pride. I push myself personally. I think the world of Willy. I think he is a fantastic goalkeeper and I know full well that if my standards drop, Willy will be in goal. That is how it is at Manchester City. That is how it is with England. I know it is the same thing here. I need to be on my toes and performing at a high level otherwise someone takes your spot.\u2019 And Hart is not content with game, striving to better himself. \u2018I can improve everything, management of the game. But I want to improve on everything and don't just say that lightly. I look at everything I do. You don\u2019t set limits. I want to keep going and keep pushing and keep my place in the two teams I\u2019m with \u2013 Manchester City and England. I hope the best is to come. That is what I\u2019ll be pushing to do. \u2018Every game is a rescheduled goal for me. It genuinely is. I\u2019ve enjoyed the two games with England but I turn my head to Palace now. That is the next game for me and the one I\u2019m looking forward to.\u2019 Hart labelled Buffon, who won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, a 'legend of the game' And if he needed any inspiration in that quarter, a look across to his opposite number on Tuesday night at the Juventus Stadium would have provided it. As Hart won that 50th cap for England, Gianluigi Buffon was winning his 147th at the age of 37 and proving as sharp as ever. The England goalkeeper is a fan. \u2018It\u2019s hard to look past Buffon. He\u2019s absolutely amazing. What a keeper \u2013 147 caps, countless titles, the World Cup, European trophies. What a goalkeeper and what a gentleman. He\u2019s real idol of mine and it\u2019s a real privilege to share a pitch with him. \u2018I\u2019ve got a long way to go. But to see people like that at the top level is a real good feeling. I like him. I\u2019ve watched his career and how he is around people. It\u2019s a small amount of time you spend with people when you are in the tunnel with them but he oozes class. 'He is a classy guy and it\u2019s great to have an icon like that. Fraser Forster played against Juventus a few times and said the same thing.\u2019 Only in one area will Hart not be emulating Buffon. With his designer stubble, flowing hair, and his silk waist coat and designer shirt, Buffon looked a little more like a successful artist or film-maker than a footballer as he left the Juventus stadium. \u2018He does look cool,\u2019 said Hart, with a degree of self deprecation. \u2018I\u2019ll never try to be him. With my mousey blonde hair, it wouldn\u2019t really work.\u2019",

Marking her answers with red pen, she scored an impressive 43.5 out of 50, to which he commented, 'Well done Saskia! As a result, I will not be dumping you! (Lucky you)'. Saskia posted snaps of the test to her Twitter account, @saskiaisabxlla, commenting 'Boyfriend made me take an @Arsenal exam!' with emoticons showing she didn't know whether to laugh or cry. We don't blame her. Saskia's football fan boyfriend made her take an Arsenal test and didn't dump her thanks to her A grade . The test took the form of a school exam, with multiple choice questions, tables to complete, and 'in your own words...' section. There were even 'helpful' instructions including 'Read every question at least twice' and 'Check your answers if you have time at the end'. Oh, and 'calculators may be used'. Saskia scored an impressive 87 per cent, but according to her unnamed boyfriend's feedback she 'could have performed better on Q17', needs to 'Learn ALL player positions' and should understand that 'Tottenham are scum'. What does the 'FC' in Arsenal FC stand for? What is the nickname for Arsenal fans? Who is the current manager of Arsenal? Is the kit below (see picture) Arsenal#s current Home kit or Away kit? Name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions. In your own words, explain why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard. Who are our top 2 goalscorers of the season so far? What was the scoreline for the 2014 FA Cup Final vs Hull City? What player scored the winning goal in the 204 FA Cup Final? a) Olivier Giroud . b) Santi Cazorla . c) Aaron Ramsey . d) Per Mertesacker . Why are Arsenal the best team to ever grace English football? Questions put to her in the test included: . 'What was the scoreline for the 2014 FA Cup Final vs Hull City?', . 'What player scored the winning goal in the 2014 FA Cup Final?' 'Name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions.' She struggled to come up with the 11th player of the starting  squad (Koscielny, defence, apparently) and thought Ozil was defence and Wellbeck a midfielder, when in fact they are midfield and striker respectively. Tut tut. She scored some decent points for her more creative answers. Asked to explain why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard in her own words, she wrote, 'Sanchez is buff, scores lots of goals, Hazard is a p***k, Sanchez is Chilean'. She got double marks for the Hazard comment, but only got half a point for the last one. Saskia clearly knows how to keep her boyfriend happy, as she humoured his question of 'Why are Arsenal the best team to ever grace English football?' with the answer of 'They've won many FA Cups' and 'Thierry Henry is a legend'. However, when she got an answer wrong, her examiner wrote the correct answer in capitals and drew an angry face. This man clearly means business. Doh! Saskia struggled to name all 11 players of the starting squad and got confused on the player positions . Saskia's boyfriend drew an angry face when she got a question wrong - this man means business . Saskia kept her boyfriend happy with creative answers to his questions, and got double marks for some... He was impressed with the end result, though, grading her an 'A' and rewarding her by not ending their relationship. And they say romance is dead. Comments generally hailed the man as a 'legend' and fellow football fans were impressed with Saskia's knowledge. Some Twitter users hailed the unnamed boyfriend who tested Saskia on her Arsenal knowledge as a legend . Scoring 87%, football fans were impressed with Saskia, claiming her as 'proper GF material' May men felt inspired, with @lewisxweeked warning his girlfriend to 'get revising' Indeed, @gstarrs85 congratulated Saskia and stating that she was 'proper GF material'. Plenty of men felt inspired by the post, with @lewisxweekes telling his girlfriend @LayciJade to 'get revising' and @DigsXIII crying 'WHERE CAN I GET THIS TEST FROM?' Others, though, felt that the boyfriend had taken things a tad too far. @GunSaurEd11 stated 'football fans are nuts', and @DCSLFC commented 'Imagine actually broadcasting that your boyfriend is the biggest biff-head ever to the world.' We reckon it was  a bit of fun and he wouldn't really have dumped her if she'd failed... at least we like to think that's the case. Trimothy wants to put his girlfriend to the test, although apparently can't be bothered to create his own exam . Eduardo claims 'football fans are nuts' despite appearing to be one as he holds what looks suspiciously like the FA Cup in his hands... Some thought Saskia's boyfriend took things too far with @DCSLFC creatively naming him a 'biff-head'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland (CNN)Protesters angry over the death of Freddie Gray got into physical altercations with police Saturday night in downtown Baltimore near the city's famed baseball stadium. Some of the hundreds who confronted lines of  police officers got into shoving matches with helmeted cops while other demonstrators threw objects. At least five police cars were damaged by people who smashed windows and jumped on them. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was profoundly disappointed by the violence, adding that 95% of the protesters were respectful but a \"small group of agitators intervened.\" Twelve people were arrested, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. \"We continue to have a few isolated pockets of individuals causing disturbances. We are deploying resources to keep everyone safe,\" the Baltimore Police Department tweeted. Fredericka Gray, the twin sister of Freddie Gray, made a statement: \"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence? Freddie Gray would not want this.' Freddie's father and mother do not want any violence. Violence does not get justice.\" Vandals broke and damaged storefront windows and trashed one 7-Eleven, police said. CNN crews observed a window damaged at a Michael Kors store and holes in one at a Subway restaurant. The skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on April 12. He died a week later. The numbers of protesters dissipated substantially just before sunset, though some people were still walking in the streets near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, causing some traffic problems. Earlier, demonstrators had marched through the streets until they arrived at City Hall. Along the way, whenever it appeared the protest might get out of control, organizers reined the marchers back in. The event ended after speeches at Baltimore City Hall on Saturday evening, but many protesters continued to vent their anger by marching down to Inner Harbor. When demonstrators got to the stadium, tensions escalated and some people threw what appeared to be water bottles and other objects at the cops, who wore helmets and stood behind metal barricades. Fans who were arriving to watch the hometown Orioles play the Boston Red Sox were having trouble finding ways to the entrance gates. The Orioles won the game 5-4 in extra innings. For a time it appeared that fans would be held inside the ballpark until the demonstration quieted, but the gates were opened before the contest was over. Throughout the day, protesters yelled, \"No justice, no peace\" and \"All night, all day; we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray.\" The police department used Twitter to update the public on the progress of the march. At City Hall, speakers demanded justice for the Gray family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects. At least one protest organizer had promised in advance that the event would be big enough to shut down the city, but while many people turned out and walked, the major disruption was only to traffic on a few streets. Gray died last Sunday. Protesters have marched since, outraged by the arrest, which was recorded on a bystander's cell phone and the nature of Gray's death. The witness said Gray was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. At some point after he was detained, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. On Friday, police officials said that Gray should have received medical care at the site of his arrest and at other times as he was transported to a police station. The van carrying him stopped three times on its way to the station where he was to be booked, but when it arrived at the Western District officers called for an ambulance, which took him to a hospital. The questions investigators are looking into are: How and where did Gray suffer a severe spinal injury? And are police liable for his death? The preliminary work on his autopsy has been done, but the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and may invite spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report may take 30 to 45 days. Batts told reporters on Friday there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care \"multiple times.\" Those comments upset members of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police. \"We are disappointed in the comments made yesterday by Commissioner Anthony Batts, and various members of his command staff, relative to the actions of the officers directly involved in the Gray investigation,\" Gene Ryan, president of the organization said in a written statement. \"These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete.\" Police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. A wake for Gray will be held Sunday, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday.

Dave Doggett, the boss of League Two outfit Cambridge United, believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals prior to games. He said violence at matches has increased recently as the older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs'. Scroll down for video . Dave Doggett, the chairman of Cambridge United, has warned of a new breed of hooliganism and believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals . Mr Doggett\u00a0said violence at matches has increased recently as older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs' Writing in his club's latest programme, Mr Doggett said: 'Unfortunately football clubs still attract an undesirable element of society that appear determined to ruin the enjoyment of real supporters of football clubs. 'Our promotion to the Football League appears to have encouraged our \"risk\" from the 1980s to come out of retirement. 'Many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their \"gangs\". 'It sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality. We are working closely with police. 'Hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables. 'Our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport.' Peter Woor, a Cambridge United fan, said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as Southend United and Luton Town. He said: 'There's a tension and you feel threatened so I don't go to those places anymore. It's not worth it. 'Most places are fine though, but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden. 'I remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it's nothing like that but it's still a problem. 'These people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this. It's very sad.' Cambridge supporter Simon Dobbin, 42 (pictured with wife Nicole), remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after an away game to Southend on March 21. Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' Mr Doggett said older men were those causing violence. Pictured: Police with fans following reports of disorder outside Southend's Spread Eagle pub prior to the recent match between the Essex side and Cambridge . One Cambridge season ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said a group of about 30 fans regularly turn up to games looking for trouble afterwards. He said: 'They arrive after the game starts and then leave before it finishes to find a fight.' Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after their game away to Southend on March 21. Essex Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' and believe he was set upon by a group of thugs intent on attacking the visiting Cambridge fans. Cambridgeshire Police said the force has also seen an increase in the 'severity and volume' of football-related disorder this season. Inspector Steve Kerridge said: 'We have seen an increase in football-related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people, both in Cambridge and other locations when the club has travelled. 'The tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in Southend have been reported widely and sicken us all. Mr Doggett said Cambridge United had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to League Two last year. Pictured:\u00a0Southend United's Barry Corr beats Richard Tait to the ball in last month's match . 'The club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with Cambridge United.' He said police are using football banning orders, which impose 'stringent court-backed' restrictions on individuals. He added: 'The increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary.' The warning comes as football chiefs across the country continue to promote the Kick It Out Season of Action campaign to promote respect within football.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nI conducted a poll on my radio show recently, and more than 70 per cent of those who voted believe Manchester United will win the title next season. Is it heart ruling the head among the United faithful? Or is there a genuine belief that serial winner Louis van Gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again? Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Van Gaal poses for pictures with United fans at the training ground during a day for the club's foundation . Van Gaal (pictured talking to fans) is starting to assert himself at the United after a stuttering start . If he is to take United back to the very top, he\u2019ll need more than Memphis Depay. I\u2019ve already established in this column recently that Van Gaal is a great, and he is a winner. I love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career. The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time \u2013 just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department \u2013 his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don\u2019t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it\u2019s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He\u2019s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he\u2019s dealt with Van Gaal\u2019s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I\u2019ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019s a winner and a leader \u2013 perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view \u2013 Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can\u2019t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney\u2019s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate \u2013 for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season \u2013 he\u2019s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble \u2013 European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that\u2019s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV\u2019s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It\u2019s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?",

Google confirmed to\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service (similar to PayPal and Venmo) in multiple federally-insured banking institutions. This is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their Wallet Balance because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000. Currently, Google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the FDIC. However, a Google spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the current policy has changed. The policy states that 'funds held by Google Payment Corp. or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Payment Transactions are not deposit obligations of Buyer, and\u00a0are not insured for the benefit of Buyer by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency', according to\u00a09to5. As a non-banking institution, Google Wallet, along with PayPal and Venmo, is not legally required to be federally insured. But with the new change to its policy, funds in Wallet Balance are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy. For example, for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not FDIC insured, if a company files for bankruptcy, the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back. But for users with FDIC insurance, they would receive their money from the government in a matter of days, according to Yahoo Finance. Details on when Google Wallet's user agreement will be updated were not provided. How Google Wallet works: . Google Wallet, launched in 2011, stores credit and debit card information, and lets shoppers pay for goods by tapping their phones against special terminals at store checkout counters. It works with any debit or credit card, on every mobile carrier. The service allows users to send money to anyone in the US with a Gmail address, or request money on-the-go, directly from their bank account, debit card or Wallet Balance. Users can spend received money through the service in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs with the Google Wallet Card, as well as transfer the funds directly to their bank account. It comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring, and users can disable their Wallet app or card from their Google Wallet account if they're ever lost or stolen. Source: Google Wallet . Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected Google Inc's request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the technology company of invading the privacy of users of its Google Wallet electronic payment service by sharing their personal information with outside app developers. The judge said Google must face claims it breached users' contracts, violated the federal Stored Communications Act which limits disclosure of electronic records, and violated a California consumer protection law. Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California said Google Wallet users may try to show that Google 'frustrated' the purpose of its own privacy policy by allowing 'blanket, universal disclosure' of their personal information to app developers whenever they bought apps in Google's Play Store. The lead plaintiff is Alice Svenson, an Illinois resident who said Google sent unnecessary personal information about her to YCDroid when she paid that developer $1.77 for an email app. She said Google raised the risk of identity theft by routinely sending information about Google Wallet users such as addresses and zip codes, phone numbers and email addresses to app developers. Svenson said the Mountain View, California-based company ceased the practice soon after the lawsuit was filed in September 2013. Her lawsuit seeks class-action status, damages of $1,000 per violation, punitive damages and other remedies.",

Gov. Nathan Deal signed a bill Thursday that will legalize low-THC cannabis oil for certain \"medication-resistant epilepsies,\" while creating an infrastructure, registration process and research program for the drug. (THC is the primary psychoactive substance in marijuana.) The bill is dubbed Haleigh's Hope Act. Haleigh, who has been the face of the bill, was having hundreds of seizures a day and the five potent drugs meant to control them weren't making life better for the little girl. Janea Cox said in a March 2014 interview that she made the difficult decision to move her daughter to Colorado, where medical marijuana is legal, in hopes of saving her life. \"She was maxed out,\" Cox said. \"She'd quit breathing several times a day, and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications.\" 10 diseases marijuana could affect . Cox had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help, but it wasn't available in Georgia. So a week after hearing a doctor's diagnosis that Haleigh might not live another three months, she and Haleigh packed up and moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, Haleigh began a regimen of cannabis oil: four times a day and once at night. \"Every time she smiled I knew we did the right thing, because we hadn't seen her smile in three years,\" Cox said. \"Now she's thriving, she's healthy, she's happy, and they're absolutely shocked at the difference. So I think we've turned some nonbelievers into believers of cannabis oil.\" Deal is apparently one of those believers, signing HB1 on Thursday and opening the door for the use of cannabis oil to treat certain medical conditions. The bill will benefit not only people who suffer from chronic seizure disorders, but it also will allow patients to receive in-state treatment. To obtain a license in Georgia, you will need to have a specific covered condition, such as acute seizures. \"For the families enduring separation and patients suffering pain, the wait is finally over,\" Deal said Thursday. \"... Now, Georgia children and their families may return home while continuing to receive much-needed care.\" For Cox, it's a blessing \"to be able to come back home, and with Haleigh's medicine, it's done wonders for her -- going from 200-plus seizures a day and on her deathbed to a smiling, happy girl who says words now and looks us in the eye and lets us know she's in there.\" She added, \"Colorado has been good to us, but Georgia's home. Georgia's definitely home.\" With medical marijuana legal in nearly half the states, doctors are increasingly studying what effect the drug has on various ailments. While Georgia's law is specific to a handful of conditions, medical marijuana laws in states such as California permit marijuana use for an array of ailments. But as states rewrite their regulations, federal law remains the same: Marijuana is illegal to grow, sell or use for any purpose. Under the Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" To backers of reform, it presents a Catch-22: Marijuana is restricted, in large part, because there is scant research to support medical uses, yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions.",

Detective Inspector David Waddell says police are investigating whether the earlier incident involving a woman is linked to the fatal knife attack outside the local pizza shop. It was shortly after midnight when emergency services found Mr Gibbins and his 25-year-old friend with serious stab wounds at about 12.10am from the alleged random attack.

David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales, said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact. He suggested that the success of so-called SSRI drugs \u2013 which include Prozac and Seroxat \u2013 was based on the \u2018marketing of a myth\u2019. Scroll down for video . The idea that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, psychiatrist Professor David Healy argues. Pictured is Prozac, one commonly prescribed  SSRI . The emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression. Even though they were weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they took off because of the idea that SSRIs restored serotonin levels to normal, \u2018a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance\u2019. In an editorial in the BMJ, Professor Healy said that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything. He said: \u2018For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients. \u2018For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.\u2019 However, other psychiatrists have refuted the professor\u2019s claims, saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance. They warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the \u2018real world\u2019. Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u2018That antidepressants are helpful in depression, together with psychological treatments, is established.\u00a0How they do this is not. \u2018Most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model. \u2018Most important of all, SSRIs are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics. \u2018People should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone.\u2019 NHS Choices, the website which advises patients, says: \u2018It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms.\u2019 Professor Healy\u2019s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs. He said: \u2018In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year\u2019s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday\u2019s models. \u2018The emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble. 'We need to understand the language we use. Until then, so long, and thanks for all the serotonin\u2019, he concludes. Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King\u2019s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: \u2018Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn\u2019t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs \u2018correct\u2019 an \u2018imbalance\u2019 of serotonin in the brain. \u2018Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain. Other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the \u2018real world\u2019 \u2018Prof Healy fails to mention that SSRIs supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose, not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin\u2019s involvement in depression.\u2019 Dr Paul Keedwell, Consultant Psychiatrist and Specialist in Mood Disorders, said: \u2018In the real world of the clinic, SSRIs are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression. 'They have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side-effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose. \u2018David Healy has previously claimed that SSRIs cause dependence or provoke suicide. \u2018In so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem. \u2018The risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants, and yes, this includes SSRIs.\u2019",

The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nCharlie Adam looked up, noticed Thibaut Courtois was off his line, and thought: \u2018Why not?\u2019 Why not, indeed. The Stoke City midfielder was 66 yards from goal but had the audacity to score what will surely be crowned the Barclays Premier League\u2019s strike of the season. David Beckham did it against Wimbledon in August 1996, as did Wayne Rooney against West Ham last March. There was Xabi Alonso in 2006 and Maynor Figueroa three years later, too. Charlie Adam (centre) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois watches on as he is unable to stop Adam's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1-1 . Yet this was different. It was not a hit and hope. It was not a lob. This was a direct shot from deep inside Adam\u2019s own half which fooled one of the world\u2019s greatest goalkeepers \u2014 and Adam meant it. Sportmail\u2019s Jamie Redknapp agreed. \u2018This is better than Beckham, more audacious than Rooney\u2019s last season, This is one of the best strikes we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s an absolutely incredible piece of play by Charlie Adam. \u2018You categorise goals as great individual efforts or team goals, but that was a piece of genius. To even try it is brilliant.\u2019 Even by the standards those at Stamford Bridge are used to seeing week in, week out, this was special. Particularly because it came from an unexpected source, from a \u2018bloke who looks like a bus driver\u2019, as former English cricket captain Freddie Flintoff colourfully put it. Nineteen years ago, when Beckham introduced himself to the world with his goal from the halfway line, he did so wearing the wrong footwear. The Manchester United great beat Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan wearing custom-made boots embroidered with \u2018Charlie\u2019 on the tongue \u2014 adidas sending Beckham a pair which were actually intended for Rangers attacking midfielder Charlie Miller. Adam (second left) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game . David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . Chelsea became the second team to score 100 penalties in the Premier League. Liverpool were the first and have now scored 102. Miller never got his boots as they were retired, turned into a museum piece, having helped Beckham towards his first of 115 England caps less than three weeks later against Moldova. From one Scottish Charlie to another, Adam plans to frame his boots and shirt from Stamford Bridge, but this goal is unlikely to be the making of the former Rangers, Blackpool and Liverpool midfielder as it was for Beckham. Yet in the four seconds it took for the ball to go from boot to net, Adam disproved the theory that sequels are never better than the original. \u2018The manager kept saying to me, \u201ccome in the middle of the pitch\u201d, to try to get on the ball,\u2019 Adam said. \u2018I\u2019m not a winger, I\u2019m not a wide left midfielder, I don\u2019t have the pace to go in behind so I\u2019ve seen an opening, I\u2019ve seen the goalie off his line and I thought, \u201cwhy not do it at a place like Chelsea?\u201d 'I\u2019ve seen the goalie back-pedalling and I was praying it would go in. I\u2019ll remember it for the rest of my career.\u2019 From Spain\u2019s Marca to Italy\u2019s La Gazzetta dello Sport, the goal has been admired worldwide. One man who does not want to see it again, however, is Jose Mourinho. It left a black mark against a win which moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, yet even the Chelsea manager can admire a wonder-goal when one comes along, as much as it hurts to admit it. Even Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had to admit that Adam's goal was a strike of the highest quality . Adam (right) celebrates with his Stoke City team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . \u2018It was a fantastic goal, every player in the world would like to score a goal like that,\u2019 Mourinho said. \u2018Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi to all these brilliant players. Not all of them did score that goal in their careers.\u2019 Maradona, Messi, and Adam. Unlike the Argentinian greats, he is known more for his heavy tackling, as Gareth Bale found out when he suffered ankle ligament damage in May 2011. Yet this was straight from the Pele playbook. Stoke had not managed a single shot on target with half-time minutes away and there seemed no danger as Adam picked up the ball 10 yards inside his own half. Courtois mistakenly thought the same. Yet this is nothing new from Adam. He did it for Blackpool reserves previously, and Ross County, too. Asked if it is something he thinks about using regularly during a game, Adam said: \u2018Every time.\u2019 Midway through this interview, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba interrupts. \u2018Why?\u2019 he asks Adam in mock indignation. \u2018Tell me why?\u2019 To which Adam replies: \u2018I watch your videos.\u2019 Indeed there are compilations of goals just as outrageous on YouTube and, on Saturday, Adam rightly earned his place in history among them.",

A 21-year-old man has been arrested after a man died following a late-night brawl in Clacton last night. The suspect from Clacton was arrested on suspicion of murder at 11.40am. He is being questioned in connection with the death of the man, who was named locally as James Gregoire. The 54-year-old victim, known as 'Pongo' was killed in what Essex Police are describing as 'an altercation' in the town. Officers have closed off a large area of Clacton town centre as forensic specialists conduct a finger-tipped search of the crime scene. A second man was seriously injured in the brawl although his injures are not described as life threatening. A third man suffered minor injuries. It is understood that the brawl continued across the town until one man collapsed and died. All of those involved in the incident are believed to be known to each other and are from the area. A large area of Clacton's town centre was cordoned off this morning as forensic officers conducted a full search of the scene looking for evidence. The incident started at a property on High Street before the brawl spread across the town. Mr Gregorie's body was found in an alleyway between Beach Road and the town's Covered Market. Two of the major shopping roads in the town, Station Road and Pier Avenue have been closed as well as the alleyway where the body was found. Businesses in the area have been warned that large sections of the town will be closed for much of the day as the forensic investigation continues. Mr Gregorie's son Nathan posted a tribute on Facebook: 'r.i.p daddy I cnt believe ur gone I dnt know wat to say I ain't seen u in awhile ima miss u so f****** much love you forever and always.' Mr Gregoire, was jailed for two years in February 2012 after he was caught trying to sell crack cocaine following an undercover police sting. Police believe Mr Gregoire was killed as a result of a brawl that carried on across Clacton's town centre . Essex Police have closed off a large area of Clacton's shopping district while forensic searches continue . Forensic officers gathered evidence across a large area of Clacton due to the size of the crime scene . Superintendent Steve Ditchburn, who is leading the murder investigation said: 'Unfortunately due to the large number of scenes and the extensive cordon day-to-day business in Clacton town centre has been severely disrupted. 'This is necessary to ensure as much early evidence is gathered as possible but we are working as quickly as we can to keep disruption to a minimum. 'I would like to appeal to anyone who has information about the incident, saw any men in and around the Rosemary Road and Station Road areas of the town at around 11.30pm last night, or who has any information which may assist detectives, to contact us as soon as possible.' An Essex police spokesman added: 'Any witnesses or anyone who has information should contact detectives in Clacton on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.' Mr Gregoire's son Nathan led tributes to his late father on his Facebook page earlier this morning . Police confirmed they arrested a 21-year-old man earlier today on suspicion of Mr Gregoire's murder . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, was arrested Wednesday night at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago after returning on a flight from Turkey. He has now been charged in a criminal complaint with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Joshua Van Haften, 34, of Madison, Wisconsin (pictured left in his mugshot on Wednesday and right in 2010 when he\u00a0registed on the sex offender's list) has been accused of flying to ISIS in a failed attempt to join ISIS . The criminal complaint, which had been under seal since Oct. 28, alleges that Van Haften talked to people about his plan before leaving the United States in August for Istanbul. The complaint cites Facebook posts from Van Haften that said he was unable to cross the border from Turkey into Syria. In one post, Van Haften complained that the people who were supposed to help him just wanted his money, that he had almost no cash left and that he was dropped off on a road in the country and never picked up. Wisconsin court records showed several previous convictions for Van Haften, including felony battery in 1998, second degree felony sexual assault in 1999 and disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in 2007, online court records show. He was apprehended at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday after getting off a return flight from Syria (file picture) All of the offenses occurred in Rock County. Van Haften was sentenced to three years' probation on the battery conviction in 1998, but his probation was revoked in 1999 and he was sentenced to a year in jail. He was sentenced to eight years' probation on the sexual assault charge in 1999, but that was revoked in 2000. He was then sentenced to seven years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Carlin from the Department of Justice said stopping people from traveling to the region to join the Islamic State is a 'top priority'. She said in a statement: 'Stemming the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria and holding accountable those who attempt to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations remains a top priority for the National Security Division.

The men were part of a group of five divers from the East Coast and San Francisco. Ten friends, including the dead men, had rented a house on Caspar Cove 160 miles north of San Francisco to hunt for abalone, a rare and expensive mollusk that is prized as a delicacy. The Santa Rosa Press Democrat\u00a0reports that the accident in Mendocino County is the deadliest single incident involving abalone divers in recent memory. Witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough, choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby. Abalone is a prized delicacy that sells for up to $70 per pound. The annual abalone season brings divers out into the rough waters of northern California (stock image) The three men died after diving into rough waters off of rocky coastline in Mendocino County, California, on Sunday in search of abalone (stock imagine of abalone diver) Firefighters said the men dove into water in Caspar Cove and found themselves immediately in trouble. An off-duty firefighter who happened to be fishing nearby spotted the men and called for help. The three men who drowned were overcome by the churning water and crushed against the sharp rocks on shore. Rescuers managed to pull the two survivors and one of the dead men from the water immediately after arriving on scene. A Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office helicopter plucked the second victim from the sea and brought him to shore. Ten friends from the East Coast and San Francisco rented a house on Caspar Cove to dive for abalone, locals said. Five of them went out on Sunday - three died . Firefighters performed CPR on the two drowned men on the beach as his horrified friends watched - but both were pronounced dead on Sunday afternoon. The third man's body was found after a five-hour search that involved aircraft and boats from several fire departments and sheriff's offices, as well as the US Coast Guard. He was smashed against rocks in a cove, which required rescuers to hoist his body up the cliff with a winch because they couldn't get to him by water. Local authorities say the abalone season, which started April 1, is always marred by several rescues and often a few death.

Jeff Green, then playing for the Boston Celtics, was looking forward to getting back to the hardwood. That was until a routine physical stopped him in his tracks. The physical revealed he had an aortic aneurysm near the left valve of his heart. \"I was shocked,\" said the Memphis Grizzlies small forward. \"I had no symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath.\" Green had to have open heart surgery. \"Leading up to it was nerve-racking,\" he said. \"I couldn't run. I couldn't touch a basketball. I couldn't get stressed out, it was tough.\" As Green learned how doctors would open up his chest to repair his heart, he considered the possibility he may never play basketball again. \"The first couple of weeks after I was told, I really focused in on my career and what was next,\" said the basketball player. \"I wanted to make sure if I wanted to come back, I was able to come back and play the same way I did before I left.\" If that opportunity wasn't there, Green wanted to have a backup plan. So, he headed back to his college roots at Georgetown University, finished his degree and became the first person in his family to graduate from college. Green's NBA basketball career wasn't over, but it was a slow progression back to the court. He missed the entire 2011-2012 season. \"I didn't even watch any basketball,\" he said. \"Six months after the surgery was the first time I set foot on a court.\" It was with the Hoyas where Green laid back down the foundation of his game, healing his body and regaining muscle. \"The timing was off,\" he said.  \"I wasn't concerned about getting hit, the biggest thing was just being in shape and being able to move and being able to function on the floor.\" Green believes the surgery and hard road back to the NBA have given him a new perspective and more meaning in his life. \"I will never forget those days that I could walk 15 steps for five minutes,\" he said. \"Now I attack every game like this could be my last.\" \"I feel like the year I missed really added more years,\" he explained.  \"It added more life into what I'm doing because I'm more grateful for it.\" Green's now using his story to raise awareness of hidden heart risk.  He also spends time with children dealing with cardiac issues -- often telling them they are \"superheroes\" and encouraging them to \"show off your scar -- embrace it!\"",

Mario Mandzukic complains he was elbowed after a clash with Sergio Ramos left him with a bloodied face . Daniel Carvajal appeared to move his mouth towards Mandzukic's arm in an off-the-ball scrap . The referee was not looking at the incident as Carvajal then struck out towards Mandzukic . The Atletico Madrid striker fell to ground after tussling with the Real Madrid defender . 'Mario was trying to cause a bit of trouble,' the former Manchester United midfielder told ITV. 'The amount of times he was down, he made a meal of a few things. He makes out to be a tough centre forward but he was anything but.' Ironically Mandzukic was booked for a foul on Varane when it looked like he had been elbowed again, shortly after he needed treatment to stem the blood flow from above his eye after a clash with Ramos. Carvajal, meanwhile, denied that he had bitten Mandzukic. He said: 'I've seen that after the game I have been accused of biting another player, I want to say clearly that I haven't bitten anybody, nor attempted to do so.' The Madrid derby saw Real control the first half before the scrappy second period was dominated by Mandzukic's battles off the ball. Paul Scholes criticised Mandzukic for 'making a meal' of many of his second-half clashes during Atletico Madrid's 0-0 draw with Real Madrid in a Champions League quarter-final . Mandzukic lies on the ground holding his face after appearing to be be fouled . Referee Milorad Mazic confronts Mandzukic after the striker was left bleeding following a clash with Ramos . Luka Modric acts as peacekeeper as Mandzukic and Cavajal argue at the Vicente Calderon . Atletico physios treat the striker for the cut above his eye as manager Diego Simeone (front) looks on . Scholes states that the goalless draw means Atletico have the upper hand going into the second leg at the Bernabeu, after the Champions League holders failed to convert their first half chances, with Gareth Bale arguably wasting the best opportunity after being denied in a one-on-one with Jan Oblak. 'It could be a dangerous result for Real,' Scholes added. 'If Atletico get a goal at the Bernabeu, Real need two. Real should have won in the first half. Atletico have to thank their keeper for keeping them in it. 'The second half was poor and not a lot of chances were created. Real will be disappointed because how well they played in the first half, they missed a couple of chances and they could regret it.' Mandzukic's cut came after he was caught by an elbow from Sergio Ramos early in the second half . Mandzukic was later booked before colliding again with Carvajal with a forearm while challenging for a header .",

He drew the attention away from the cold reality of a disappointing display against Burnley; away from the fact that Tottenham\u2019s chances of now qualifying for the Champions League appear extremely remote. If there was a danger Mauricio Pochettino might have to endure some less than flattering headlines, Kane at least offered an alternative.

The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14\u00a0Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino\u2019s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. \u2018He deserved it,\u2019 he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. \u2018He has the quality,\u2019 he said. \u2018So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).\u2019 Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. \u2018It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,\u2019 Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City\u2019s recent defeat here and complained that \u2018long balls into the box\u2019 made Sean Dyche\u2019s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal\u2019s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. \u2018Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??\u2019 tweeted Darren Anderton.

Walker was forced off through injury in the second half as Tottenham chased the win against Burnley at Turf Moor . Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game \u2014 they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England\u2019s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham\u2019s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson\u2019s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team\u2019s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. \u2018I think we edged the game,\u2019 said Dyche afterwards. \u2018Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he\u2019s probably just hit too cleanly. But I\u2019m pleased by the fact that we\u2019ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.\u2019 Not that there was much evidence of that here.

But in his life, 50-year-old Walter Scott was also the father of four children and served in the Coast Guard before being honorably discharged. \"He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody,\" his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon. \"All the family loves him, and his kids loved him.\" Until it all came crashing down Saturday morning, when North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run. Why did he run? Justin Bamberg, a lawyer for Scott's family, speculated Thursday it could have been related to \"child support and a fear of maybe going back to (jail).\" At the time of his death, Scott owed over $18,000 in back payments for two children and hadn't made a payment since July 2012, according to Charleston County family court documents. Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years. \"I know that it had nothing to do with anything violent,\" Bamberg said of Scott's legal history. \"He was not a dangerous person.\" According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun. Slager fired eight shots, five of which struck Scott. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, \"running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty,\" Stewart said. Slager has been charged with murder, a charge that might not have come about if not for a bystander's video of the shooting. Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family. \"When I saw that video for the first time, my family was deeply hurt that someone would gun down a human being in that way,\" the brother said. \"We just couldn't believe it.\" The last time the family got together with Walter Scott was when the siblings threw a surprise wedding anniversary party for their parents. \"It was a great celebration,\" Anthony Scott said. \"My dad and brothers planned it, and (my mother) was totally surprised. \"Now this happens,\" Scott said, referring to his brother's shooting. \"It's so tragic.\" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

Jamie Anderson said the CGI characters did not have the same charm as the 'lovingly detailed' miniature puppets. Thunderbirds will return to our screens tonight 50 years after the futuristic puppet show launched and landed all over the world. However, the jerky puppets that rescued the world from all kinds of disaster have been replaced by CGI images to create an entirely new look. Original: Gerry Anderson, co-creator of Thunderbirds, with star puppets Parker and Lady Penelope . Remake: In the updated version, the 'lovingly detailed' puppets are replaced by computer-generated images . Writing for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Anderson, whose father died aged 83 in December 2012, said: 'The classic Thunderbirds shows have sometimes attracted fond criticism as \"quaint\", \"naff\" and \"full of wobbly sets\". 'But there is something to be said for real-world physics, the constraints they bring to film-making, and the ingenuity and beauty that results as we grapple with them. 'With CGI, by contrast, anything is possible. There are virtually no limitations. Impossible camera angles and effects can be achieved, and constraints get ever looser.' He added: 'I'm very fond of puppets, physical models and practical effects \u2013 real explosions rather than computer-generated ones. 'There is something utterly magical about seeing a puppet come to life under the skilled operation of talented puppeteers. 'Sadly for fans old and new alike, that's not going to be possible with the new series.' Iconic: Gerry Anderson with a model of Thunderbird 1 - his son Jamie has criticised the new CGI characters . Quest: As with the original show, the remake will feature the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world . Thunderbirds aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002. There were 32 episodes over two series, broadcast in 66 countries. The show sparked a merchandising frenzy, with more than 3,000 Thunderbirds products sold, so much so that December 1966 was labelled Thunderbirds Christmas. As with the original show, the remake will feature the adventures of the Tracy family whose mission is to save the world through their secret organisation International Rescue. The five brothers, all named after real astronauts on America's Mercury space mission in the early 1960s (Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John), all live on Tracy Island in the South Pacific in 2065. When they hear of trouble anywhere on the planet\u00a0their swimming pool slides open to allow a rocket (Thunderbird 1) to take off. There is also an aircraft carrier, submarine and spaceship based on the island. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a shoestring budget . The iconic children's classic\u00a0aired in the UK between 1964 and 1966 and repeated in 1992 and 2002 . Jamie Anderson, son of Gerry, said there was something 'utterly magical' about seeing a puppet come to life . The updated version of the iconic show is not the first attempt at a remake. Thunderbirds, a 2004 Working Title film with real actors (including Ben Kingsley as arch-villain The Hood), was a dismal flop, losing almost \u00a320 million at the box office. Even Gerry Anderson, the show's co-creator, called it 'the biggest load of c**p' he had seen. The original show was made on a factory estate in Slough, Berkshire, on a modest budget, but the new production team spans the globe. Peter Jackson's animation workshop Weta in New Zealand made the 26 episodes (a further 26 are already commissioned) using a mixture of live action and computer graphics. Rosamund Pike, the Gone Girl star, will voice Lady Penelope in the new show and 89-year-old David Graham has returned to voice her driver, Parker. He has dropped his chauffeur uniform and now sports a roll-neck sweater. He also has a clipped Indian accent. The new version kicks off on today at 5pm on ITV with a double episode, before moving to an 8am slot on the same day.",

At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety. Win on Saturday and they will be out of the relegation zone. For Nigel Pearson and his men, their season starts now. When you\u2019re facing relegation you are supposed to be dispirited and lacking in confidence. So how on earth have Leicester won three on the bounce? Only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can better that as a winning streak. Leicester players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the Premier League . It has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for. Leicester were bottom on Christmas Day but win at Burnley and they will give themselves a real chance of staying up \u2014 something only two sides have managed after being bottom at Christmas. It\u2019s not just Leicester, though. The other promoted clubs \u2014 QPR and Burnley \u2014 have shown fantastic spirit. I have been in relegation battles and seen teams with less fight in them than these three. QPR earned a fantastic win at West Brom, were unlucky to draw at Aston Villa and battled manfully against Chelsea. Burnley might be on a poor run but you know Sean Dyche\u2019s side will battle until the bitter end. So how does a manager create a positive attitude when things look so bad? What you can\u2019t afford to do is let players sit and study the fixtures and start looking at how many points they need. If they are too busy working out the permutations, they\u2019re not concentrating on their game. Leicester face a crunch clash with fellow relegation battlers Burnley on Saturday . If a player is not being pushed it\u2019s easy for them to shift responsibility and hope somebody else gets them over the line. The best thing to do is keep them busy. If you\u2019re working hard on the training ground looking at team shape, developing players and preparing for games, you are making much better use of your time. I\u2019ve been in that situation as a player and the worst thing you can do is to wrap them in cotton wool. There is a tendency to try to protect people in case things go wrong. Training eases up because of injury fears and managers try to keep their players fresh. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has managed to create a positive attitude in his squad . But that leaves you sitting around with your thoughts and that can be dangerous. There needs to be mental stimulation \u2014 you can\u2019t sit around and wallow in self-pity. At this stage of the season a week can be a long time between games. Pearson and his players will be absolutely buzzing in training and it\u2019s important to take that energy and intensity into games. It annoys me when managers say it\u2019s all about results. The only way to win is to make sure that your performance is right and that comes from hard work during the week. Pearson has worked hard to make sure Leicester\u2019s destiny is in their own hands. Their form has struck fear into other teams. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring in the 2-0 victory against Swansea . The three promoted sides look brave enough to go out and play, but Sunderland and Hull look paralysed by fear. Steve Bruce thinks Hull\u2019s home form will keep them up but a look at the fixtures shows it won\u2019t be that easy. Leicester, QPR and Burnley have all given their home fans reason to cheer with their efforts and the thrill of the chase means everything is applauded. Contrast that with the toxic feeling at the Stadium of Light. Leicester have taken a long time to wake up but they have rekindled the atmosphere they had when they beat Manchester United. And with four of their last six games at home, they need to keep that up. If they can, and the level of their performance continues to harness the positivity of that home crowd, don\u2019t bet against them making the great escape. Fans still believe that Leicester can still avoid the drop from the Premier League .",

All I can say is that in my practice I see lots of girls with low ferritin levels [stored iron rather than iron in your blood], who shed hair and stop shedding once you correct the ferritin level.\u2019 Meal: Eating protein with every meal is vital to strong, healthy hair, as hair consists of protein, experts say . Sally-Ann Tarver, a former president of the Trichological Society now based at The Cotswold Trichology Centre, recommends Florisene pills (\u00a315.95, lambertshealthcare.co.uk), which contain iron, because these don\u2019t seem to cause the digestive irritation linked to standard pills. But Professor Andrew Messenger, a consultant dermatologist at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, says that while there are many supplements claiming to help promote hair growth, very few have strong evidence to support them. Two years ago, a clinical trial looked into the efficacy of the supplement Viviscal (\u00a329.99, Boots). The study involved 63 women: 33 took the supplement, 30 a placebo. After six months, the hairs in those taking the supplement had increased in width by an average of 7 per cent compared with the placebo group, which were unchanged. However, Professor Messenger remains unconvinced. \u2018As far as I am aware, this study has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and did not appear to look at other parameters, such as hair density,\u2019 he says. \u2018Whether a 7 per cent increase in hair diameter can be reliably measured is doubtful, as is whether it is clinically significant.\u2019 Research found women with increased hair-shedding responded well to iron supplements . It might be worth checking your protein intake. As Philip Kingsley, a trichologist, explains: \u2018Hair consists of protein, so eating sufficient protein is vital to strong, healthy hair.\u2019 He suggests having protein at every meal. A good diet including protein is certainly important, says Dr Jolliffe. She points to the fact that those with anorexia or a very low BMI suffer from hair loss. \u2018However, I am not sure I can justify saying you need to eat protein at every meal,\u2019 she says. There is some evidence that an amino acid (or protein building block) called l-lysine may play a role in hair loss. A review published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dermatology found that women with increased hair-shedding responded well to l-lysine and iron supplements (l-lysine is thought to help the body to absorb iron). L-lysine is found in particularly large concentrations in poultry and fish, but it is also in smaller amounts in soy and eggs. However, supplements or dietary changes won\u2019t pay dividends overnight. \u2018It usually takes more than two months for the hair follicles to begin to benefit from dietary changes and as hair only grows half an inch a month, it may take as long as six months before you begin to notice any changes,\u2019 says Philip Kingsley. \u2018But stick with it because perseverance pays off.\u2019 The caffeine in Alpecin caffeine liquid hair energiser (\u00a37.49 for 200ml, from chemists) is said to stimulate weakened hair roots. But does it work? Professor Andrew Messenger says that a study published last year shows caffeine can stimulate human hair growth in vitro, ie in a test tube.

Kim Hill, from Suffolk, has bravely waived her right to anonymity and spoken about how she was abused by Derek Osborne from the age of four. The now 31-year-old revealed she was forced to dress up in her mother's lingerie at the age of eight, and was even made to watch pornographic films. Kim Hill (left) was abused for years by her step-father but never revealed her past until her partner Rob (right) encouraged her to approach the police about her attacker. The couple pictured on their wedding day in 2013 . For years, Kim bottled up the painful memories until she met her husband Rob, 34, who guessed that she had been abused and helped to put Derek behind bars 20 years after the offences. While planning their wedding in 2013, Rob asked his fianc\u00e9e if she had been abused as a child due to her withdrawn nature. His question finally prompted Kim to confess what happened to her. The mother-of-two says that Rob's question finally gave her the nudge that she needed to reveal her past. 'I'd waited my whole life to hear that question. I was desperate for someone to bring it up, so I could tell them the truth. Derek Osborne (left) abused Kim (right as a child aged seven) from a young age encouraging her to get into his bed for 'cuddles' At the age of nine Derek (pictured) forced Kim (pictured left as a child) to dress up in her mother's lingerie and watch porn films . 'When Rob asked me it was my chance to share the painful secret I'd been hiding \u2013 that the man I had called dad had abused me.' She told Rob how her step-father made her climb into bed with him and kiss and cuddle him. He even attacked her two days after her 12th birthday, while taking her out for a celebratory meal. Speaking about the abuse, Kim, who married Rob in 2013, said: 'I didn't know any different so I accepted what he was doing as normal. 'I saw him as my dad. I just thought my dad loved me very much.' Kim's biological father died when she was young and she was aged three when Derek began a relationship with her mother. She says that as a young child Derek's attention was originally welcomed in her large family. 'I scrambled for mum's attention with my three siblings. But I was always Derek's favourite. 'He'd come and tuck me into bed while Mum watched television downstairs.' But the attention soon turned sexual. She said: 'He would kiss me on the lips. Kim never revealed her past until Rob asked her if she had been abused ahead of their wedding . 'He often called me into his bed at night for a cuddle, so he could touch me under the covers. 'I was too young to know how wrong it was. I thought nothing of it. But years went by and the touching became more intimate.' Aged seven, Kim was taught sex education at school which soon made her realise that her step-father's actions were not normal. She said: 'I found out at school how babies are made. 'I was horrified, all I could think was, \"What if I have a baby growing inside me?\" 'I knew how upset mum would be if she found out and I'd get into so much trouble.' Kim was too scared \u00a0to approach anybody about her attacker and the abuse continued. She said: 'When I was nine, he forced me to dress up in mum's underwear, then he made me watch sick porn films. 'I didn't know any different so I accepted it as normal.' But that all changed when aged 10, Kim saw a television programme about sexual abuse. She said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I realised my dad was abusing me. 'Next time he tried to touch me I was in tears and pushed him away. Although he was angry, I stood my ground. Part of me wanted to tell mum, but I didn't want to hurt her.' But weeks later, her mother sat her down with some news that would come as a welcome relief. 'She told me that her and my stepdad were splitting up. Finally, I could escape him.' However to Kim's horror her mother wanted to keep Derek around as a father figure. For her 12th birthday, he took her out for a celebratory dinner. But he pounced when they were alone at his house afterwards and performed a sex act on her. She said: 'My feet were kicking as hard as I could but I wasn't strong enough to push him away. 'A look of anger spread across his face as he tried to hold me down. 'After, I felt disgusting. That was the last time he abused me. Afterwards he moved away with a new partner.' Ahead of the wedding Kim reported the abuse to the police where it was revealed Derek had abused other girls . Although she had finally escaped her attacker Kim was still living with the effects of the abuse. She said: 'I'd become so withdrawn, and jumped whenever anyone brushed past and touched me.' Although Kim met a man aged 18 and had a daughter at 23, the relationship did not work out. She found it difficult to trust and stayed away from the dating scene until a friend set her up with Rob. She says that right from the start Rob offered her huge support and she found him trustworthy. 'I wasn't sure and it was the first proper date I'd had since having my little girl. 'He talked about his sister, who's also a single mum and how difficult she's found it. 'From the very beginning, Rob was so understanding.' Kim and her daughter moved in with Rob after six months and just weeks later in August 2010 he proposed. Kim said she was able to seek justice after confessing all to Rob. Pictured on their wedding day . Kim has began to visit counselling sessions and says she is beginning to move on . The couple had a son in January 2012 and started planning the big day. She said 'Me and Rob shared everything, but I still didn't dare tell him what dad had done. We'd started making plans and wanted the perfect venue.' While searching for wedding venues, Rob asked her if she had been abused as a child. The question came as a huge shock to Kim. She said: 'I broke down in tears. I didn't know how he could guess. 'He said that I was different to other women because I was withdrawn. He encouraged me to tell mum what had happened. 'And with his support the next day I called the police.' After her brave confession Kim discovered that she was not alone and Derek had attacked a string of victims. 'I was the first victim to come forward but soon other victims spoke out and said Derek had abused them too. ' Kim has started her own blog to share her experiences and inspire others . When he was arrested, Derek denied all the offences and even claimed one of the girls had made sexual advances towards him. With the trial looming, in September 2013 Kim and Rob tied the knot. She said: 'I didn't think of Derek once. He might have destroyed my childhood, but he wasn't going to ruin the best day of my life.' In May 2014, Derek, then 72, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court where he admitted 16 counts dating from 1982 and 2004, including eight of indecent assault and seven of indecency with a child, related to Kim and two other schoolgirls. He also admitted raping another woman. He was jailed for 21 years. In October 2014 one count of gross indecency with a child, not relating to Kim, was quashed at the Court of Appeal in London, but his sentence remained the same. Kim said: 'I went to see him sentenced. He was so pathetic and frail, he was unrecognisable.' Judge John Holt said Derek's victims had all suffered 'devastating' psychological effects. He said a probation officer who interviewed Derek had assessed him as 'dangerous' and said he had shown 'very little' genuine remorse. Now he is behind bars, Kim says that she has been able to begin to move on. 'I've started counselling and healing sessions with the Happiness Foundation. They're helping me to accept it and move on. 'Rob is there with me every step of the way and I know he's so proud. I've also started a blog about everything I've been through. 'I've had so many victims of sexual abuse thank me for telling my story and showing you can put your abuser behind bars \u2013 even years later.'",

Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in\u00a0Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The \u00a0name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is \u2018likely\u2019 to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by\u00a0Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged. This famous photograph, produced in 1934, was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, on his deathbed . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . Another renowned sighting was made in 2001 by semi-retired photographer James Gray and his friend Peter Levings when they were out fishing on the Loch . This blurred picture, said to show the Loch Ness Monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express .",

'But that shouldn't mean he should be indebted to the extent of feeling he owes everything to the club. If the club created top players from nothing then everyone would make it. 'A club is quick to get rid of a player when they don't serve a purpose anymore so why should a player not do what's best for him when the boot is on the other foot?'

His case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma. Too often and for too long, people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen. When we don't distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one, we reinforce a pernicious idea that's both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness. Some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help. That's why in our public and more private discourse, people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that doesn't drive some into the darkness. We need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing. And we have to recognize that \"mental illness\" is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways. People with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment, many can recover and live healthy, productive lives. We must encourage them to open up, and when they do, we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously. It wasn't that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly-kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members, friends and especially employers. But that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer, their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease. Similarly, and with the courageous example of Michael J. Fox, we've seen perceptions about Parkinson's disease change for the better, as people learn more about what it is and isn't. Time to talk about depression . That's the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better-informed public discussion. We have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear. That includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place (through laws and regulations like the Americans for Disabilities Act) for individuals who disclose their disability. We also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk. It's a difficult balance. Sooner rather than later, policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people. At the same time, we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities, families and employers. That can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions. If companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society, we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground. We won't pretend that this is an easy problem to solve. But, awful as Germanwings Flight 9525 tragedy was, the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue. We need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness.",

However, he will be handed an instant route back into football should he lose his job at Loftus Road. Sherwood rates Ramsey as one of this country\u2019s best coaches and will find a senior role for the 52-year-old should he depart QPR.

A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media,\u00a0Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but\u00a0has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say. Confession: Vera Maresova (right) was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation . Sick: All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Vera Maresova (pictured covering her house outside court) thought their deaths would be attributed to natural causes . Location: Vera Maresova killed five women and one man over a four-year period at this hospital in Rumburk - a small town in the north of the Czech Republic . Prosecutor Frantisek Stibor said: 'She is not insane and knew exactly what she was doing. Therefore she is fit to stand trial. 'She used her knowledge of medicine to cause malfunctions in heart rhythms which led to heart failure and death.' The first murder was in January 2010 and was followed by another at the end of 2011. In April 2012 she killed her third victim and three more between February and June 2014. Having confessed to the crime, 50-year-old Maresova now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life in prison.",

United\u2019s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions\u2019 Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal\u2019s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs\u00a0Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs\u00a0San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs\u00a0Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs\u00a0Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer\u2019s tournament around United\u2019s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer\u2019s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer\u2019s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven\u2019t visited since David Moyes\u2019 pre-season of 2013. Ander Herrera, David De Gea and Juan Mata (left to right) hold the trophy after beating Liverpool in Miami .

His daughter can be heard screaming as she runs to help, but she is pushed from behind by a young girl and slams face-first into the concrete. Mr Racsits said he went to pick his daughter up after she called to say some girls wanted to assault her, the\u00a0Newcastle Herald\u00a0reports. There had earlier been some trouble between Kiara and at least one girl before she called. As he went up the escalators and called his daughter telling her to come out of the movies, he noticed three girls standing nearby. 'And within 15 seconds, there was like 20 of them. I don't even know where they came from,' he said. The incident took place outside the\u00a0Charlestown Square shopping centre in Newcastle, north of Sydney .

Mr Racsits was walking his daughter down the stairs when he pushed a young man out of the way to get to their car. 'But as soon as I have pushed him out of the way, there was just kicks and punches from the side,' Mr Racsits told the newspaper. He was dragged about 10 metres across the road before they started punching and kicking him. His daughter can be heard screaming as she runs to help, but she is pushed from behind by a young girl and slams face-first into the concrete .

'As I was going down I was just basically covering my head up and I actually grabbed one of the guys legs and bit him on the leg. It was the only thing I could do.' The father and his daughter were treated at the scene for minor injuries, but Mr Racsits is undergoing further examinations to check if any of his ribs were broken.

Broad produced his best and quickest bowling since knee surgery last year to take three wickets for 19 here in Grenada before a defiant last wicket stand of 52 from Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel lifted West Indies to 299. Then Cook, fighting for his captaincy in this series, and the under pressure Jonathan Trott joined forces to hit their first half-century partnership as an opening pair and reach 74 without loss by the close of a rain-affected second day. Stuart Broad\u00a0produced his best and quickest bowling since knee surgery last year on day two in Grenada . Quick Broad took three wickets on day two as England bowled West Indies out for 299 . Captain Alastair Cook, who won the toss and chose to bowl, worked his way to 37 not out at stumps . Broad backs Cook to go onto a big hundred and get his side in a winning position with three days left . When Cook reached 17 of his unbeaten 37 he went past Alec Stewart to become the second highest run-scorer in England's Test history and now only his mentor in Graham Gooch stands ahead of him. 'He's been an amazing performer for eight or nine years now,' said Broad. 'And he's such a level headed character that you never know whether he's got nought or 200 if you bumped into him in the evening. 'Cooky won't be thinking about personal landmarks now. He knows if he gets a big hundred tomorrow he will set his team up with a fantastic chance of getting a result and it was great to see Cook and Trott back together again.\u00a0Hopefully they can score a lot more runs tomorrow.' Broad revealed that a chat with new bowling coach Ottis Gibson and a change of technique led him to add 10 miles per hour to his bowling overnight and look back to his best. Cook plays a shot to the legside as he found some form on a rain-interrupted day two at St George's . Broad celebrates the wicket of West indies captain Denesh Ramdin, who was caught behind on 31 . 'I made a slight change overnight after watching quite a lot of footage of how I got my wickets and I was a bit wider on the crease which allowed my momentum to go straight through,' said Broad, who touched 91 miles per hour when bowling a beauty to take Denesh Ramdin's wicket. 'It seemed to work and I was really pleased with how I bowled today.' Despite some momentum in the favour of Cook's side, Broad admits England are battling both the weather and an at time defiant West Indies as they look to force victory. With unpredictable forecasts around, Broad knows only full days of cricket and a sizeable first-innings lead will leave the tourists on track. Broad celebrates after reaching 91 miles per hour for the delivery that took Denesh Ramdin's wicket . Cook and Jonathan Trott leave the field at stumps having guided England to 74 runs without loss . 'The only way we can win is by getting 400, 450 in the first innings and applying pressure that way,' he said. 'We need a bit of lady luck, blue skies in the morning and hopefully there's not too much swing. 'You can't have mornings like we've had on every day of the Test or it will be a draw. 'But we've got a pretty simple job from now, which is to bat a day and half to two days because I don't think anyone really knows how this wicket will behave late on day three, four or five.'",

FIFA announced last week that the decision on the 2026 tournament will be made in 2017 - when Blatter is still likely to be FIFA president. The FA has decided not to bid for FIFA tournaments while Blatter is still in power following England's failed bid for 2018, but is eyeing a bid for the European Championship in 2028.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nFormer Royal Marine Bobby Burnett beat his girlfriend and banned her from wearing revealing clothes in a two-year-long campaign of terror . A controlling Afghanistan veteran who beat his girlfriend and banned her from wearing revealing clothes has been jailed for a two-year-long campaign of terror. Royal Marine Bobby Burnett forced Samantha Chudley to stop wearing make-up because he wanted to make her less\u00a0attractive to other men, and forced her to hand over the passwords of her e-mail and social media accounts so he could monitor them,\u00a0Exeter Crown Court heard. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her\u00a0smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home. His violence and the stress of his controlling behaviour led her to have two miscarriages, one of which happened days after he punched her in the stomach when she was ten weeks pregnant, the court was told. The otherwise exemplary Marine's personality changed because he was taking a powerful illegal steroid\u00a0normally given to beef cattle to make them increase body mass, the court was told. He told police she was lying about his repeated assaults but inquiries\u00a0showed he had asked the Marines for help to control his domestic violence. And checks on his mobile phone showed hundreds of texts in which he begged her\u00a0to forgive his attacks and promised to stop hitting her. Burnett was a Marine with an exemplary service record who has been thrown\u00a0out of the Corps after a routine drug screen showed he was taking steroids. Burnett, 30, who has been in custody since leaving the Commando Training\u00a0Centre, admitted aggravated harassment and making threats to kill and was\u00a0jailed for two years and two months by Judge Phillip Wassall. He told him: 'Miss Chudley lost all confidence in herself. She was even\u00a0having to check with you what she could wear and you began to chastise her\u00a0for wearing make up. 'If she ever questioned you, your response was to attack her, grabbing her\u00a0by the neck, holding her up against walls, putting her to the floor and\u00a0telling her to shut up. 'She says the assaults happened on a weekly basis although you say there\u00a0were longer periods between attacks when you could control your temper. 'This was a relationship where you set out to control her by violence to the\u00a0extent her will was completely broken and she became completely subservient\u00a0to your control over the best part of two years. 'You were not only abusing alcohol but taking steroids at the time and it is\u00a0well known they can cause bad temper and cause violence. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home, the court was told . 'This was a protracted history of very serious domestic violence. The\u00a0aggravating features are the continued and repeated threats and extreme\u00a0domestic violence. 'You now acknowledge your responsibility and I believe you have had a change\u00a0of heart and are far less dangerous than you were. It is an attribute of\u00a0your steroid abuse that it played some part in your behaviour.' The judge made a restraining order banning Burnett from contacting Miss\u00a0Chudley ever again. Miss Emily Pitts, prosecuting, said texts recovered from Burnett's phone\u00a0showed the domination he asserted over his partner. One said: 'I won't\u00a0change. You will always have to live by my rules and do what I say.' She only left him after two years of repeated assaults and his increasing\u00a0domination in which he would attack her and call her a s**g if she wore make\u00a0up or attractive clothes. Miss Pitts said his attacks and bullying led to Miss Chudley becoming a shell of her normal self and feeling worthless and enslaved. Miss Pitts said: 'She went through months and months of torture. He would go\u00a0out of his way to make her feel like she was nothing. 'She says she felt worthless and he destroyed all her confidence. Friends\u00a0told her they did not recognise her as the same person while she was under\u00a0his control. 'He would constantly question her about where she was and who she was with\u00a0and installed a tracking app on her phone. She felt sick and trapped. 'She is petrified that when he is released she will become the focus of his\u00a0rage at the fact that his life has fallen apart and will find her and hurt\u00a0her or even kill her.' Mr Barry White, defending, said that since acknowledging his guilt Burnett\u00a0is a changed man who is determined to address the issues which led him to\u00a0treat Miss Chudley as he did. He provided references from Burnett's previous partner and a new girlfriend,\u00a0both of whom say he has behaved well towards them. He also provided testimonials from the Marines showing an unblemished 11\u00a0year record in which he saw action in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the 2011\u00a0operation in Libya. He said: 'He went off kilter. This relationship was toxic and dysfunctional\u00a0and he knows he carries the burden of responsibility for that.'",

But one group of women were so fed up with their friend's 'running commentary' they went to the extreme measure of putting an anonymous letter in her mailbox demanding she give everyone 'a break'. Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found the scathing note claiming to be from \u2018a few of the girls\u2019, cruelly criticising her for posting photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook. \u2018Dear Jade, I have got together with a few of the girls and we are all SO OVER your running commentary on your life and every single thing Addy does,\u2019 the letter begins. \u2018We all have kids that we are besotted\u00a0with ... But we don\u2019t ram it down everyone else\u2019s neck!!!\u2019 Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found a scathing note  criticising her for posting too many photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook . Jade Ruthven was devastated when she received the  unsigned letter in her mailbox . As the letter continues, the typos and punctuation become more intense and frequent. \u2018She crawls off the mat \u2013 we DON\u201dT care!!!!! She\u2019s six months old \u2013 BIG DEAL!!!! \u2018Stop and think \u2013 if every mother posted all that cr*p about their kid \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get over it pretty quickly.\u2019 The author claims the rant was written on behalf of everyone who views Jade\u2019s Facebook posts. \u2018I guess you are just p***ing a lot of people off with all your \u201cAddy this and Addy that\u201d. \u2018We all thought it might ease off after the first month but it hasn\u2019t,\u2019 the letter continues. \u2018Not everyone is as interested as you are about what Addy does so give us all a break. \u2018We\u2019re doing this to let you know what people really think.\u2019 The dental hygienist still doesn\u2019t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can\u2019t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty . Jade and her husband Ryan (pictured with their daughter Addison) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter . Jade sent the letter to comedian Em Rusciano, who posted it to her Facebook page and described it as 'next-level mean' in an opinion piece for\u00a0news.com.au. For\u00a0Jade the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face, particularly as she is a first-time mother trying to find her feet. \u2018I was actually excited when I checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was in it!\u2019 Jade told Daily Mail Australia. \u2018At first I was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke. I read it and re-read it about four times. \u2018I was shaking with anger and shock to think a so-called friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name.\u2019 The dental hygienist still doesn\u2019t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can\u2019t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty. \u2018To be honest I have no idea why anyone would do this to me. I don\u2019t think I have had an enemy in my whole life,\u2019 she said. \u2018My husband Ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke. Jade and her friends responded by creating the hashtag #Addyspam and cheekily posting a stream of photos of the beautiful bub on Facebook - sending a strong message to the hateful author . Jade was accused of 'p***ing' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on Facebook . \u2018These people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my Facebook usage. It\u2019s quite sad really.\u2019 The cruel nature of the letter spurred Jade to stand up for herself. She refused to bow down to the bullies. \u2018To have someone do this to me, in truth, makes me feel sick,\u2019 said Jade. \u2018Lucky for me I am a strong, healthy person. Being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences. \u2018But it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter!\u2019 Jade wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down. She has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby. \u2018I have had people contact me saying if this had happened to them at this time in their bub\u2019s life, it would have sent them over the edge. \u2018I am glad I was the one that got this letter, not someone in a more vulnerable state.\u2019 Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has \u2018backfired\u2019, as she is \u2018feeling more loved and supported than ever\u2019 Jade insists that not for one minute did she consider changing her behaviour on Facebook. Instead, she decided to deal with the bullies with a sense of humour. \u2018No way did I feel self-conscious or consider changing my online activity,\u2019 she said. 'That\u2019s how I think this person can\u2019t be that close to me. If they were they would know I would never take this lying down, start crying in the corner and then take myself off Facebook. \u2019In fact my friends and I started a hashtag, #Addyspam and posted pics of Addy on Facebook all night long!\u2019 Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has \u2018backfired\u2019, as she is \u2018feeling more loved and supported than ever\u2019. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers . \u2018The support I have received from family, friends and even total strangers has blown me away.\u2019 Facebook is a crucial tool for Jade and Ryan to share their daughter\u2019s life with their distant relatives. \u2018Addy\u2019s grandparents and a lot of family and friends live overseas. Facebook is the only way they can really keep in touch.\u2019 As a mother, Jade knew she didn\u2019t want to stoop to the bullies\u2019 level. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers. \u2018I want my daughter to grow up a strong and confident girl and if she ever does encounter bullies. \u2018I want her to feel strong enough to stand up for herself. \u2018Also I think parents should do what feels right for you and your bub. \u2018Everyone will try and give you their opinions, just smile and nod!\u2019",

The Gold Moto 360 is available to pre-order online from O2 and any customers making orders before 10pm BST on 20 April will receive the watch on 21 April. It will then go on general sale online and exclusively from O2  stores in the UK on 23 April. The Gold model (pictured) is available to pre-order online from O2 and any customers making orders before 10pm BST on 20 April will receive the watch the next day. It will then go on general sale online and exclusively from O2 stores on 23 April . The original Moto 360 has a 22mm black leather strap and costs \u00a3199. Motorola's Gold version has an 18mm stainless steel band and costs \u00a350 more, at \u00a3249.99 - which is \u00a350 cheaper than Apple's cheapest Sport model. The Moto 360 watch launched last year and won praise for its circular design that was seen as a move away from the bulky and computerised-looking Pebble Steel, Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch. It features a 1.5-inch LCD touchscreen with a thin metal band and is powered by Google's Android Wear operating system. The Moto 360 smartwatch runs on Android Wear (pictured).

It was one of the first smartwatches to use a rounded display and rumours suggest Motorola is working on a second-generation model. Apple's Watch is currently available for pre-order in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia, Hong Kong, China and Japan but some models, particularly the Edition range, have sold out in many regions.

A former Celtic star tried to dodge performing unpaid work for shoplifting from Harrods - after claiming it would disrupt his search for a new club. Andre Blackman, 24, who now plays for doomed Championship side Blackpool FC, stole a jacket worth more than \u00a31,000 from the world famous store in Knightsbridge. Blackman, who has been told he is \u2018surplus to requirements\u2019 by Tangerines boss Lee Clark, described the offence as a \u2018moment of madness.\u2019 He was ordered to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work after Hammersmith Magistrates\u2019 Court was told he fled from the shop with the \u00a31,225 jacket. He was arrested shortly afterwards and the jacket was recovered. Blackman told Deputy District Judge Samantha Mace: \u2018It was just a moment of madness. It was not something that I intended to do, or something I do regularly. \u2018I\u2019m just absolutely speechless.\u2019 Blackman told the judge his attempts to find a new club might be hindered if he was forced to carry out community work. He said the travelling to different clubs would be the biggest problem. Explaining his situation, he said: \u2018I have got my current agent looking around on my behalf and there have been a few clubs that might be interested. \u2018And because we are closer to the end of the season they are just waiting to see whether they are going down or staying up.\u2019 \u2018Once I do work for a club I would have to come back to the court and say that something has come up.\u2019 Judge Mace told Blackman, who temporarily resides in a hotel in Blackpool using the \u00a3125 living allowance he receives from the club, that he would be more than capable of carrying out unpaid work before the new season begins. Blackman has already played for 11 clubs in his short career. Blackpool defender Blackman has played just three Championship games for the Tangerines this season . Blackman has been told by Blackpool boss Lee Clark that he is surplus to requirements at Bloomfield Road . He played for Arsenal\u2019s academy between 2001-06, and Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s between 2006-07. Blackman signed his first professional contract with Bristol City in 2009, making his debut in a League Cup match against Brentford in August 2009, before playing for AFC Wimbledon, Celtic, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Plymouth Argyle, Dover, Maidenhead, and most recently Blackpool. He was awarded \u2018Tackle of the Year\u2019 at Celtic when he accidentally collided with manager Neil Lennon during a match, sending him crashing into the turf . Judge Mace told Blackman his offending was at the \u2018lower end\u2019 of the spectrum, and that 40 hours of unpaid work could be completed before September. She added that if the order really hinders him from finding a new club then he can apply to the court to be sentenced in another way. Judge Mace said \u2018Because you haven\u2019t been signed by a club just yet, you should be able to complete the hours before the new season, and if you really really can\u2019t do it you can make an application to the court to deal with sentence in another way.\u2019 The judge ordering him to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order and to pay \u00a385 in costs. \u2018As I have said, because the goods were of a high value, the fact you do have a similar conviction - albeit a long time ago - and the fact that you did try to run away from the shop before being apprehended by the police, this makes it serious enough to merit a community order. \u2018In the present circumstances I do think it\u2019s appropriate for such an order to be made. \u2018It would be far more serious if you had not pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.\u2019 Blackman, of Edymion Road, Brixton, southwest London, must complete his community service by April next year.",

The massive fire started  last Wednesday and took more than 24 hours to put out. John O'Connor, a highly experienced former police detective, has claimed the major power outage and the proximity of the multi-million burglary was far more than a coincidence. Scroll down for video . A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . It came shortly after firefighters  battled a major fire in Holborn - just 500 metres from the raid site . Speaking on LBC, Mr O'Connor said: 'Yeah, I think that probably was deliberate. 'I've never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that. That seems to me as too much of a coincidence.' He also said that in his opinion, to succeed with such a complicated and ambitious crime, the gang must have had some inside help. He added: 'You're gonna have to have a detailed layout of the whole of the business. So clearly they got that from somebody on the inside.' He later told Sky News: 'You've got a major strong room, there's no sign of a forced entry, they've apparently been able to abseil down the lift shaft to get access to the vault - I just find it astonishing that it was that easy. 'The fact that there is no sign of forced entry, what does that mean? That someone left the door open? That someone left the windows open? Former head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, John O'Connor, pictured, said the Holborn fire and the raid could be linked . 'It smacks all the time of inside aid, all of the way through it. This doesn't look to me like a genuine sort of smash and grab raid by determined criminals, this looks like they've had accomplices on the inside.You wouldn't go to attack a building like that unless you knew you could gain access.' The London Fire Brigade said they do not believe that the blaze was caused deliberately. Fire experts said their initial assessment showed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the Victorian tunnels running below ground, damaging an eight inch gas main which ruptured and fuelled the flames. Fresh details of the daring heist emerged yesterday as police forensic teams continued to sift through the rubble in the vault. It is believed an alarm was triggered when the professional gang broke into the building in the heart of London\u2019s jewellery district. A security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the property on Good Friday before leaving when he found nothing untoward. Police have refused to say whether officers were despatched to investigate around the same time. The gang used a heavy-duty drill weighing 77lb to bore through a reinforced 7ft concrete wall to reach the vault. When the raid was discovered on Tuesday, police discovered cheaper jewels left strewn amid a large heap of rubble in the vault. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad said: \u2018I\u2019d say it\u2019s a sophisticated offence and clearly it would have taken some pre-planning. It\u2019s organised. It\u2019s people who have planned it and they know how they were going to go about it. \u2018I would imagine that the pool of people [who could carry out the heist] is quite limited.\u2019 The  fire started underground just several hundred yards from where the heist took place a few days later . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . It has also emerged that celebrities and Premier League footballers could be among the victims of the thieves. A source told the Daily Mail: \u2018At least two of the jewellers have gems in the vault which have been bought by footballers and celebrities. They are waiting nervously to find out if they are among the victims.\u2019 Mr Johnson described how the gang gained access to one of the offices on the second floor of the building where they disabled the lift before climbing down. Once in the basement the thieves forced open the lift doors to get close to the vault. They used a \u00a33,500 Hilti DD350 drill, which is commonly used on large construction sites, to drill through the reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault. Joel Vinsant, secretary of the Drilling and Sawing Association, said that even with high-tech equipment, it may have taken hours for the thieves to drill through the concrete. He said: \u2018What they might have done is to bore several holes with a rig-based drill until they had made a space big enough to get through, rather than boring one hole and breaking through. It could have taken up to an hour per hole.\u2019 Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Police yesterday revealed the thieves used a Hilti DD 350 drill to get through the two-metre thick vault walls . During the raid the gang used an angle grinder and crowbars to force their way into 70 deposit boxes to steal the gems and cash inside. They then made their escape before employees arriving for work on Tuesday spotted the raid. Mr Johnson added: \u2018The scene is chaotic. The vault is covered in dust and debris and the floor is strewn with discarded safety deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars. \u2018There is no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building. We are in the process of identifying the owners of the safety deposit boxes and contacting them to take statements and find out what has been stolen.\u2019 He said his team had only just reached the vault because of the amount of debris at the scene. Mr Johnson added: \u2018It\u2019s got to be a slow, painstaking and methodical forensic process to get in there.\u2019 Experts fear the thieves may have already smuggled the jewels out of the country and are planning to cut up the larger gems to make it easier to sell them on the black market. One jeweller who rents a deposit box said police have identified the owners of 30 boxes which had been broken into. Furious jewellery dealers today accused the manager of the safe deposit of 'gross negligence'. Pictured: Felix Stephens (left) and\u00a0Gerald Landon (right)",

He told ABC7: 'Imagine being asleep and then being stung by bees, and then waking up and going owww.' He added: 'She was smirking... I mean, she said zero at this point, and I just kind of, and all I wanted to do was not be sitting next to her.' Scroll down for video . Lenny Mordarski, 68, was viciously poked with the blue ballpoint on a flight to New Hampshire on Thursday because he fell asleep and was snoring before take-off . Lenny Mordarski, 68, described the attack by a female passenger to 'being stung by bees... owww!' The woman was removed from the flight following the air rage incident and put on a later flight out of Chicago . Crew appear to pass the pen used by the female passenger in the assault on fellow traveler as he slept . The woman, dubbed 'Psycho Pen Lady' by another fellow passenger, was removed from the flight. The Southwest Airlines flight which was scheduled to leave  Midway International Airport at 1.15pm was delayed for almost two hours due to the 'disturbance'. The Chicago Fire Department was called to evaluate Mr Modarkski after he was stabbed in the arm. Mr Mordarski said he would not be pressing charges following the incident. His best friend, photographer Michael Sutton, said the pen stabbing began after Lenny's arm brushed up against the woman while he slept. Mr Sutton, 41, told Daily Mail Online: 'She took her pen and stabbed his arm several times causing him to yell out in pain. 'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment. 'Luckily he wore a thick long sleeve shirt or there would have been blood. He will have a few bruises in the morning. 'The passengers cheered when they heard she wasn't coming back on.' Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, South West Airlines said: 'A customer on flight 577 was removed from the flight before takeoff after poking her seatmate in the arm with a pen. 'The flight departed for Manchester shortly after the passenger was removed. The passenger in question was accommodated on a later flight. No injuries were reported.'

David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.' Armstrong said there's been no attempt to meet with Howman since 2013.",

The latest report shows that he sped up the descent of the plane to its doom. It's terrifying. As the investigation unfolds, we will learn more about to what extent Lubitz kept his mental illness secret, or how much help he sought. How much did his battle with depression affect his fitness to fly? Should he have walked away from his job? Should his doctors have sounded alarm bells? His case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma. Too often and for too long, people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen. When we don't distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one, we reinforce a pernicious idea that's both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness. Some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help. That's why in our public and more private discourse, people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that doesn't drive some into the darkness. We need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing. And we have to recognize that \"mental illness\" is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways. People with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment, many can recover and live healthy, productive lives. We must encourage them to open up, and when they do, we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously. It wasn't that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly-kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members, friends and especially employers. But that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer, their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease. Similarly, and with the courageous example of Michael J. Fox, we've seen perceptions about Parkinson's disease change for the better, as people learn more about what it is and isn't. Time to talk about depression . That's the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better-informed public discussion. We have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear. That includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place (through laws and regulations like the Americans for Disabilities Act) for individuals who disclose their disability. We also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk. It's a difficult balance. Sooner rather than later, policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people. At the same time, we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities, families and employers. That can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions. If companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society, we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground. We won't pretend that this is an easy problem to solve. But, awful as Germanwings Flight 9525 tragedy was, the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue. We need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness.",

Phil Haste, 60, was also told he had not shown a pay and display ticket in his car, even though he has a valid car parking permit on his dashboard. The businessman is now refusing to pay the fine that was issued in a Torbay council car park. Scroll down for video . 'Diabolical': Phil Haste (left) said he could not understand why he was issued with a penalty notice, as he clearly had a valid parking permit in his car and no longer required his tax disc to be shown . Mr Haste sent his appeal to the council on Saturday after being issued with the ticket last month and said it was a 'diabolical' decision to fine him. The government abolished paper tax discs on October 1 last year, meaning they no longer need to be shown on a vehicle windscreen. Mr Haste, who lives in Torquay, said: 'I would rather go to court than pay the fine. Issuing tickets of this ilk show they haven't got a clue what they are talking about. 'It's diabolical. The council employ these people to do a job for them and it's clearly not being presented clearly. 'They are obviously trying to just grab money where they can. I don't understand why I got this fine.' 'Haven't got a clue': The 60-year-old was also told he had not shown a pay and display ticket in his car, even though he has a valid car parking permit on his dashboard (pictured) The 60-year-old, who owns the yacht brokers' Quayside Marine, added: 'I don't need a tax disc so I don't know why they issued this. 'I have a car parking permit which was clearly on display on the dashboard of my car, so I just can't understand it.' Torbay Council said it was not their policy to issue fines for road tax offences and urged Mr Haste to appeal. A spokesman said: 'We do not issue parking penalty charge notices with regard to road tax and Mr Haste will have been advised on how to appeal against this ticket as it is stated on the reverse of the penalty charge notice.'",

Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. However, Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Harry Kane calmly slots Tottenham's third goal in time added on after coming one-on-one with Krul . Kane celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as Spurs claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle . He said: 'He has big potential. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'It's a fantastic achievement and I congratulate him. He deserves this moment because he has worked a lot. It's an historic thing. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' If it was Kane who put the icing on the cake at St James' Park, it was Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat. Chadli fired them in front on the half-hour and after Jack Colback had levelled 20 seconds after the restart, Eriksen scored with a free-kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper Tim Krul. Kane killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st-minute break to leave Pochettino delighted. Tottenham striker Kane at full stretch as he is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . Kane celebrates his goal against Newcastle as opposition goalkeeper Tim Krul looks on in despair . He said: 'We fully deserved the victory and the three points. I think our performance was better than Newcastle's and I am very pleased for our players. 'I am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that wasn't good and it's important to feel victory again.' It proved a difficult day for opposite number John Carver, whose side had to contend not only with Tottenham, but a boycott by some of their own fans. Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Vernon Anita . Carver insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000-capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the Magpies, who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone, are engaged in a survival fight. He said: 'Absolutely, we're in amongst it, there's no danger of that, because you have got sides - and I'll use Leicester as an example - who are winning games. We aren't. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise . Newcastle players join Colback as the hard-working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area . 'But we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board. We have to come up with a solution, I have to come up with a solution. 'I have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye, but I need to find a way of getting some results, getting some points. People might not like what they see, but I'm going to have to do it.' Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at home . Fans applaud Newcastle's goals while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, Not Ashley' sign during the game . Geordie Carver was installed as Alan Pardew's replacement until the end of the season in January, and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since, although he is refusing to throw in the towel. He said: 'It's probably the most difficult situation I have ever been in. But I'm a fighter and I'm not going to shirk anything. I'll take the stick and I'll take the responsibility because that's the type of person I am. 'But I'm not going to give up on it. Yes, I'm angry and I'm annoyed, and I've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private. But I have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it.'

West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture. Sam Allardyce isn't that man. He had his chance and did not take it. Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club, but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea, and lost.

The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures, losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom. If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game \u2014 31 points from 17 matches \u2014 they would now be fifth in the league. Had their form since that day been played out through the season \u2014 12 points from 16 games \u2014 they would be bottom. Allardyce's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival, but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football. If a new manager is being considered, it is understandable. West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival. Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project .",

Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents, and according to the publication at least 300 police accessed the files. Acting Commissioner of West Australian Police, Stephen Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states\u00a0police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8 when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued. The next day the Perth-based former AFL star surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station.",

The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents\u00a0a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, \"Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,\"' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS.\u00a0A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.",

The appalling conditions of a dog training centre where illegal pitbulls covered in scars were forced to wear electric shock collars and train on treadmills has been caught in shocking footage . RSPCA officers discovered the five illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs at a make-shift farm in Lancashire where they had been brutally trained to take part in illegal dog fights .

All five illegal dogs - Dingo, Sheeba, Zula, Fenton and Mousey - were ordered to be destroyed. Darren Wheatcroft pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan, and farmer Simon Whitworth pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting. All three were handed suspended prison sentences and ordered to pay a total of \u00a340,000 to the RSPCA at Burnley Magistrates' Court, Lancashire. Footage shown to the court showed some of the animals, which were imported from the Netherlands and trained using treadmills, . Three men involved in illegal dog fights have been fined a total of \u00a340,000 for a catalogue of appalling animal cruelty offences after RSPCA inspectors raided their homes.\u00a0Darren Wheatcroft (centre) pleaded guilty to attempting to arrange a fight between illegal pit bull terrier-type dogs, while his son, Callan (left), and farmer Simon Whitworth (right) pleaded guilty to training the animals for fighting . Laptops, mobile phones and books were also seized in a joint investigation with Lancashire police known as Operation Cask. Messages were uncovered from Darren Wheatcroft offering a \u00a31,000 fee to secure a fight between his illegal dog and another. District Judge James Clarke slammed dogfighting for its role in 'creating a black market economy' in East Lancashire. He told the defendants: 'These dogs are illegal for a reason. They are dangerous in the eyes of parliament. Their characteristics and their training can lead to significant physical injury to one another and they are dangerous to the public. 'I shouldn't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community. While not holding you responsible for that, you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals. 'The intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals. I am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time. 'Each of you has an unhealthy interest. You have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially Darren Wheatcroft - to make money out of it, involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals. You were involved in criminality.' Darren Wheatcroft, 48, and his son Callan, 22, both of Accrington, admitted keeping and training three of the dogs. Whitworth, 44, of Oswaldtwistle, admitted keeping and training another two dogs. The footage shows the animals were held in electrical shock collars, covered with scars and were kept in urine-soaked cages without water . In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids . The pitbull type dogs were all seized and ordered to be destroyed by the courts . Darren Wheatcroft admitted a further charge of arranging a dogfight, although the RSPCA could not prove that the event ever took place. Simon Farnsworth, representing the three defendants, said: 'It is not fair to deal with all defendants equally harshly. 'Callan Wheatcroft may well have been involved under the influence of his father.' In his summary of events, RSPCA prosecutor Chris Wyatt said that the animals had a large number of scars. The court also heard home medication kits had been found during the raids. But he added: 'It cannot be proved that these injuries were the result of recent fights or that the defendants were in possession of the dogs when they may have been involved in fights with other animals.' Callan Wheatcroft, a part-time cameraman who films Blackburn Rovers football matches, was given a 16-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and fined \u00a310,000. Father-of-two Whitworth, who works on his parents' farm, was given the same suspended prison sentence but fined \u00a315,000. Married Darren Wheatcroft, who also has a daughter, was handed a 20-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and also fined \u00a315,000. All three, who had originally denied the charges, were ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid community work and banned from keeping dogs for life. Speaking after the hearing, chief inspector Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: 'These people were actively involved in the dogfighting scene. 'They sourced dogs specifically for dogfighting, including going abroad. They were thoroughly knowledgeable in what they were trying to do and they set out deliberately to build up a stock of fighting dogs at their premises. 'We've got the result we wanted and they have been punished accordingly.' An RSPCA spokesman added: 'After fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet, dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic. Often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds. 'Most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring, die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners.' If you suspect someone is taking part in dog fighting, call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999 or report it to the police.",

A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. No new appeals are pending as Sprouse's lethal injection scheduled for Thursday evening approaches. He would be the fifth inmate executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row:\u00a0Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) andcustomer \u00a0Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said a recent purchase of pentobarbital means they have enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.",

A Houston Uber driver arrested and charged last week with sexually assaulting a female passenger was granted approval to drive for the car service despite being a convicted cocaine dealer. Duncan Burton, 57, was released in November 2012 after 14-years behind bars but was allowed to work for Uber despite city controls prohibiting drug felons driving cabs. Burton was taken into custody on Wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years. Uber spokeswoman, Debbee Hancock said on Monday that Burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name. However, according to Uber's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago. That means because Burton was sentence 14-years ago, his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag. Indeed, Burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the US Bureau of Prisons. That information is readily available online by typing in his name. He was convicted in Houston and served time in Louisana and Georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior. According to Houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs. However, they could appeal and still receive one. Burton did not have a city permit to drive a cab and had never applied for an exemption. Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. Last week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks.",

After carefully saying hello to Louie's left forepaw, Uno climbs over and settle down between the huge canine's front legs. Louie then shifts his position, giving Uno the chance to nuzzle and lick his neck, before settling down underneath one of his floppy ears. After Uno noses his way forward so the two creatures' faces are side by side, Louie turns his head and nuzzle his new companion lovingly. Throughout the exchange Louie's mother, whom the family adopted at the same time as the kitten, looks on approvingly. According to the Pogue family, their dog has a great track record with kittens. When they have adopted young animals previously, a hug with the Dalmatian has been a rite of passage as they join the family.

Lyoto Machida (left) and Luke Rockhold face off ahead of their middleweight clash this weekend . 'A big set of balls. I've just got to come forward and go out there and dominate him,' he said. 'Machida likes to run around and dance and do his thing. I've just got to cut him off, slowly progress and be the bull. He tries to be the matador \u2013 sometimes you've got to play one role or the other and this is the time to be the bull and slowly progress, put him in a bad spot and make him fight my fight.

'I'll be operating at a different frequency than him \u2013 he doesn't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me.' And while Rockhold afforded Machida his respect, he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory. 'I think there is a mutual respect between Machida and me \u2013 I respect what he does,' he said. 'He's one of the best in the game and has been for a long, long time.

But at the same time, I'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate. 'I've been running marathons every day so I'm ready to go in there and chase him down.' Rockhold's last victory came against Michael Bisping last November in Australia . Machida is also coming off the back of a victory, against CB Dollaway in Brazil . Machida, meanwhile, is confident he can upset Rockhold and earn himself a title shot. 'I think if I apply my style, my technique, I can stop Luke, you know,' he said.

Peter Morris, left, was devastated when his sister, Claire, pictured right on her hen do, died in a car crash . It took two decades for the truth to be revealed - Claire had in fact been murdered by Webster so he could cash in on her life insurance. Webster had drugged his wife at their home in the Scottish village of Tarves, where they had settled after their wedding, before taking her for a drive. He then deliberately crashed their car and, after making his own escape, set it on fire so Claire had no hope of survival. Last year Claire's story was turned into an ITV drama starring Sheridan Smith. And now Peter has gone in front of the cameras to talk about his grief and to reveal the shocking detail of his sister's death, which he is still coming to terms with 21 years later. 'The fire brigade said it was the most intense fire they had ever seen from a mile away, the flames were leaping 20, 30 feet, it was just ridiculous,' Peter reveals on the latest episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos. 'A very brave fireman tried to retrieve what was left of Claire. There wasn't much left of her, poor love.' Peter said he was shocked and heartbroken when he was told his sister, a qualified nurse, had lost her life in just terrible circumstances. Claire and Malcolm Webster pictured on their wedding day in 1993, the following year he murdered her . He had no reason to suspect Webster, who Claire had met at a party, had drugged and then burned her alive. Claire had been besotted with him and was delighted when they tied the knot in 1993. Peter recalls: 'He seemed like the perfect gentleman which is exactly what she would have wanted. He was a sort of Colin Firth type character.' He said he and Webster consoled one another at the funeral and Peter believed he was suffering just as much as he was. 'He didn't say a lot at the funeral, he appeared to be in a complete state of shock as well,' he said. 'We were all standing round the graveside, in my right hand I was holding on to Malcolm's left hand. 'I was in floods of tears, and I looked at Malcolm, and he, he was also in floods of tears. And that more than anything else convinced me that it had been a genuine accident.' For years Peter continued to believe the car crash had been accidental, and while some officers who investigated the scene of the crash had their misgivings, they had no concrete evidence to suggest anything different. Felicity Drumm, pictured on Britain's Darkest Taboos, was Webster's second wife. He attempted to kill her in circumstances similar to Claire's death . Peter lost touch with his brother-in-law when Webster moved to New Zealand - but it was there that his true colours were revealed when he tried to murder again. He married Felicity Drumm and they had son together. Unbeknownst to Felicity, he started faking her signature to take out life insurance polices in her name and also began poisoning her like he had done to Claire. Felicity also appears on Britain's Darkest Taboos and reveals how it felt to be drugged. She said: 'These episodes would often begin with a feeling of blurred vision or double vision and unsteadiness on my feet, my speech was sometimes become a little bit slurred, I would stagger around as if I was drunk and then would fall into a deep sleep.' She couldn't believe her husband could be the cause of her illness but a pattern was forming. 'These events occurred after he had prepared a meal or a drink for me, they were always at the weekends, never inconveniently when I had to be able to go to work,' she said. Then in circumstances similar to Claire's death, in 1999 she was driven by Webster to a remote location when she was feeling tired and drowsy. It seems Webster could have been about to commit murder again - until he was interrupted by a phone call from Felicity's concerned parents. Felicity recalls how Webster was angry that the call had woken her up and urged her to ignore it but she persuaded him to drive her home so she could see her father. Webster then fled while Felicity learned some shocking truths from her parents. Webster pictured in 2011 when he was jailed for life after being found guilty of murder . 'We discovered that he'd opened up a private mail box, he had redirected all of our mail including bank mail which had prevented me from discovering that gradually the account was being fleeced,' she said. 'There were enquiries to real estate agents back in the Cornwall and Devon area suggesting he would be returning shortly to the UK with his infant son. At the bottom of his briefcase there was a total of nine life insurance policies, which collectively was in excess of a million dollars on my death, and they had my signature forged on them.' Chillingly, they also discovered a petrol canister in her car and Felicity is convinced she narrowly escaped death that day. Webster went on the run back to the UK while Felicity reported him to the New Zealand police. After investigating, they urged Scottish police to reopen the case into Claire's death. The lead officer in the case was Charles Henry. He said: 'The original fatal road accident was highly suspicious and it bore all the hallmarks of what was happening in New Zealand. At that particular point we were facing a highly dangerous individual who was a threat to any women that he was going to be with.' Felicity pictured in 2011 when she gave evidence against Webster during the trial in which he was dubbed 'the black widower' However, it would take years for the police to build a strong enough case to prove Claire's death was not an accident and gain enough evidence to charge Webster. By then, he was back living in Scotland and was planning to marry another woman who had no idea of his murderous history. In May 2011, after a long running trial during which he was dubbed 'The Black Widower', Webster was found guilty of murdering Claire, attempting to murder Felicity and attempting to bigamously marry a third woman to gain access to her estate. Now aged 55, he is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years. 'I think his sentence aptly reflects the horribleness of his crimes, and the fact that he feels no remorse, that it was all premeditated and, given the opportunity he was about to do it again,' said Felicity, who gave evidence against the father of her child at his trial. Peter, who had to wait 21 years to get justice for Claire, said he and his family can now finally move on even though their lives will never be the same again. Peter says Claire's death nearly destroyed their family but now they are rebuilding their lives . He said: 'If anything it taught me that you just have to be a little bit more cautious in life as to who you trust and when you trust them, because we could all be living next door to the next Malcolm Webster. 'It was an experience that did nearly destroy me and it nearly destroyed my family but thank God it didn't and thank God over a period of time we've managed to put the pieces back together and move on.'

Yesterday, Allie, 21, based in Minneapolis, delivered her beau the ten-question document, which she dubbed 'The Official Allie Davis Relationship Test', and informed him that he must score at least 60 per cent 'to stay in the relationship'. She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter, revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent, for diligently answering questions mainly about Beyonce's songs. Prove it: Allie Davis, 21, (pictured) is so obsessed with Beyonce that yesterday she made her boyfriend take a written exam on the famous singer in order to stay with her . Passed: She posted the results of the not-entirely-serious stunt on Twitter (pictured), revealing that her boyfriend of two-and-a-half years had passed with a score of 80 per cent . After a series of questions about Beyonce's songs, and those of other artists, Allie demands: 'Briefly explain the Solange Knowles elevator incident. Who was involved?' Allie's very obedient boyfriend scrawled in response: 'A billion dollars, and Jay Z got punched.' This question referred to last year's legendary family fracas at New York's Met Gala, when Beyonce's sister Solange Knowles viciously attacked Beyonce's husband Jay Z following a heated row. Beyonce, 33, later mysteriously sang in her Flawless remix with fellow songstress Nicki Minaj: 'Of course sometimes s**t goes down when there\u2019s a billion dollars on an elevator.' After a series of questions about Beyonce's songs, and those of other artists, Allie demands, 'Briefly explain the Solange Knowles elevator incident. Who was involved?' Allie also dropped in a few questions about some of her other famous popstars, One Direction included . Allie's Twitter bio reads 'I met Beyonce [left] at Top Shop and life will never be the same', and the young blonde also appears to be quite the fan of One Direction's Harry Styles (right) Allie - whose Twitter bio reads 'I met Beyonce at Top Shop and life will never be the same' - also dropped in a few questions about some of her other famous popstars, One Direction included. Asked to list the first names of three members of the British boy band, Allie's boyfriend incorrectly answered with 'Harry' and 'Zack' - to which Allie wrote on the sheet of paper: 'WTF No.' He did manage to get the last question on the exam right, however, by correctly identifying that 'no', Harry Styles should not cut his hair. Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves, 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship.' Sharing is caring: Allie, whose Twitter handle is 'Yonce', later shared a blank copy of the exam with her 2,000+ followers for them to partake themselves (pictured), 'to make sure that they're in the right relationship' At least one commentator took the stunt very seriously, writing on Buzzfeed: 'Dump her ass... this is a HUGE warning sign. [Don't] put up with this kind of deluded psycho act.' Allie then explained in her defence: 'It literally took five minutes to write and I did it because I was bored and I like to mess with my boyfriend.' She later added: 'When some people call you nuts and psychotic because of a funny Beyonce joke #lightenup'.",

Led magnificently by John Terry, Jose Mourinho\u2019s side have proved once again that a solid back four is the bedrock of any title challenge. From the meanest to the most successful, Sportsmail\u00a0takes a look at the best defences in Premier League history. John Terry (centre), Gary Cahill (left) and Branislav Ivanovic celebrate Chelsea's goalless draw at Arsenal . ARSENAL 1997-98... Lee Dixon, Tony Adams, Steve Bould/Martin Keown, Nigel Winterburn . These rear Gunners might have been getting a little long in the tooth, but it didn\u2019t stop them delivering the Double for Arsene Wenger in his first full season in English football. They conceded 33 Premier League goals along the way as they pipped Manchester United to the title. Tony Adams was the main man in a fiercely solid unit that had been forged under George Graham. They knew each other\u2019s game inside out and few defences down the years could match this one for experience and knowhow. (From left) Steve Bould, Tony Adams, Nigel Winterburn and Lee Dixon celebrate the title . ARSENAL 2003-04... Lauren, Kolo Toure, Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole . Six years on and it was an entirely new Arsenal backline that will forever be lauded for their contribution to the Invicibles, Wenger\u2019s team that amazingly went unbeaten on their way to the title in 2004. The Gunners conceded only 26 goals in the process as they finished 11 points clear of Chelsea. Campbell had succeeded Adams as the kingpin and they had more attack-minded full backs in Cole and Lauren, but the old defensive steel was as strong as ever. Lauren, Kolo Toure, Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole (not pictured) formed one of the league's best defences . Campbell played alongside Toure in the season Arsenal went unbeaten as Cole and Lauren (right) confront Phil Neville after their side's infamous 0-0 draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2003 . CHELSEA 2004-05... Paulo Ferreira, John Terry, William Gallas, Ricardo Carvalho . No team in Premier League history has conceded fewer goals than Mourinho\u2019s side in his first season in England after the Portuguese coach moved to Stamford Bridge fresh from his Champions League triumph with Porto. Chelsea\u2019s defence was breached just 15 times as they won the title with 95 points, another Premier League record. Mourinho brought Ferreira and Carvalho with him from Porto and the effect was instant. William Gallas and John Terry celebrate after the latter scored for Chelsea in a 4-1 win against West Ham . MANCHESTER UNITED 1998-99... Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Ronny Johnsen, Denis Irwin . United\u2019s Treble winners were not the meanest by any stretch, letting in 37 goals in 1999 compared with the 17 conceded by nearest challengers Arsenal. But the attacking instincts of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s side always meant it was going to be a case of \u2018we\u2019ll score more goals than you\u2019, as was evident in the two 3-3 draws with Barcelona that season. Ferguson has since said that Irwin would be the only certain inclusion in a best XI picked from his time at Old Trafford, while selling Stam was arguably his biggest regret. Either way, this back four deserves their place in the hall of fame on the basis of the club\u2019s Treble achievement. Jaap Staam (centre) and Gary Neville (right), pictured with David Beckham and Dwight Yorke (top), formed half of United's Treble-winning defence. Denis Irwin played at left back with Ronny Johnsen partnering Stam . MANCHESTER UNITED 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09: Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra . This was an altogether more compact United, conceding an average of 24 goals on their way to winning the title three years in a row. Has there ever been a better bit of January transfer business than the two deals United completed in 2006 to sign Vidic and Evra from Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively?\u00a0Vidic teamed up with the majestic Ferdinand to forge one of the great central defensive partnerships, playing together in three Champions League finals, while Neville was still going strong at right back. Nani's celebration is overlooked by Patrice Evra, Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand in the summer of 2007 . Ferdinand's partnership with Vidic helped Manchester United to successive titles in 2007, 2008 and 2009 . MANCHESTER CITY 20011-12: Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Joleon Lescott, Aleksandar Kolarov . Manchester City\u2019s success in conceding only 29 goals was ultimately crucial in snatching the title away from United on goal difference after an unforgettable final day of the season in 2012. Kompany, who lifted the trophy, was well on his way to establishing himself as a City legend, as was Zabaleta. Both players had been signed by Mark Hughes, along with Lescott, but the defensive nous of Italian Roberto Mancini helped turn City into a more solid unit before he brought in the combative Kolarov from Lazio. Vincent Kompany is mobbed by his defensive partner\u00a0Aleksandar Kolarov after scoring against Liverpool .",

Micheal John Duffy, 34, pleaded not guilty to murdering Colleen Deborah Ayers, 33, whose decomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property, located near Picton, south west of Sydney. In the opening statements of Duffy's trial Crown prosecutor Elizabeth Wilkins SC told the jury,\u00a0that while his former partner, Rachel Evans, had initiated the violent act, Duffy had willingly joined in. He claimed his co-accused, Evans, was the one who had a 'twisted desire to kill' and he had only helped bury Ms Ayers' body. Micheal John Duffy pleaded not guilty to killing Colleen Deborah Ayers after claiming he had only disposed of her body while his co-accused Rachel Evans was the one with a 'twisted desire to kill' Ms Wilkins told the court Evans was the one who grabbed the belt used to strangle Ms Ayers after telling a witness: 'We are going to kill her, we are going to kill her.' 'She put the belt around Ms Ayers' neck. The deceased bucked her off.' 'It was at that stage that the accused Duffy intervened and also started strangling her,' she said. 'This was Rachael Evans' idea. She was the ringleader and this accused [Duffy] joined in.' The court heard Ms Ayers had met Evans at a pub in Campbelltown only a day before she was gruesomely murdered. It is alleged on May 8, 2012, Evans and Duffy, along with a 16-year-old girl who can not be named, went to a hotel in Picton with  Ms Ayers. Evans, Duffy and Ms Ayers then proceeded to have sex with each other while the unidentified teenager filmed the act. The next day, after drinking and taking the drug ice, Ms Ayers invited the duo, along with another man, Scott Debridge, to her parents empty Lakesland property. Ms Wilkins told the court Evans and Duffy had planned to steal and sell firearms from the rural property so they could buy drugs. Courthouse: Duffy's co-accused Evans, who has plead guilty to murder, \u00a0will receive a reduced sentence for giving evidence at her former lover's trial . Later that night, after Evans had been 'cutting up' ice, she heard Duffy and Ms Ayers having sex. The 16-year-old witness said Evans became agitated and armed herself with the leather belt. The court heard Evans then entered the bedroom and started strangling the victim. It was at this point, the crown said, Duffy joined in. Ms Wilkins said once Ms Ayers was dead, Evans dragged her body into the bathroom so she could try to wash away Duffy's DNA. Meanwhile, Duffy and Debridge went to a dam on the property to dispose of the body where they dug a shallow grave and buried Ms Ayers. During his trial, Debridge claimed he tried to refuse the orders to dig the grave, however, Duffy 'bashed' him with a shovel until he continued. After Ms Ayers' body was buried the group proceeded to ransack her parents house, stealing jewellery, an Xbox and, as planned, the firearms. It is reported the group left in a maxi taxi at about 7.40am on May 10. In a chilling revelation, Evans then allegedly told the cab driver she had a 'very exhilarating night'. Ms Ayers wasn't reported missing until May 25, when her parents returned home from holidays to the Lakesland property, where their daughter's body was secretly buried. Ms Ayers'\u00a0discomposed body was uncovered in a shallow grave on her parent's 25-acre Lakesland property in 2012 . Police finally caught up with Evans on May 31, after her parents spent a week wondering where their daughter could be. Evans took officers to the property and showed them where Ms Ayers was buried. She reportedly told the young witness she felt no remorse for the killing. 'I feel good. I don't feel guilty. The f***ing belt buckle snapped. When I was burying her I started hitting her with the shovel. It felt so good,' the Daily Telegraph reported. During her trial it was revealed Evans sent fan mail to infamous murderer Ivan Milat and bragged to the unidentified teen-aged witness that she would become a 'serial killer' in years to come. Evans has plead guilty to murder and Debridge to being an accessory after the fact, with both receiving discounts on their sentences for giving evidence during Duffy's continuing trial.

Inside the Juventus Stadium, with 2,000 travelling England fans seated in the curva at the north west area, there was more of the same. England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's friendly draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . Michael Carrick (centre) and the rest of the England squad applaud the travelling support in Turin on Tuesday . Frankly, it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good-natured and good-humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to June\u2019s friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. It also places a strain on the FA. What can they do when thousands of travelling fans are singing: \u2018Where were you in World War Two,\u2019 or the German bomber song that has been heard for many years on our overseas trips? Toe-curling stuff. As for the IRA songs, many of the younger fans who join in with these chants cannot know or understand the significance of the Irish political situation and how it affected Britain through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties. In Dublin there will be the issue of provocation, the potential to engage with a city that has traditionally been a political hotspot.There is barely time to catch our breath before England\u2019s 3,000 supporters head to the Aviva Stadium for the first fixture against the Republic of Ireland since 1995. It was at Lansdowne Road on February 15 that year when rioting England fans - many of them associated with the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 - caused the fixture with Jack Charlton\u2019s side to be abandoned. England supporters throw missiles at Landsdowne Road 20 years ago, causing the fixture to be abandoned . In the intervening years there have been various conversations between the FA and the FA of Ireland about a fixture between the teams, but it is only now they can agree that the time is right. Let\u2019s not spoil it. The fixture with Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s labouring team on June 7 is a bookend to the season ahead of the final chapter in Slovenia seven days later. Roy Hodgson is a football man and you can tell by his pained expression at the end of every post-match briefing that he would rather not be answering questions about fans\u2019 behaviour. \u2018We can only hope that in some way we put that right before we go to Ireland because the last thing we want is anything (other) than a very good football match,\u2019 he said after the 1-1 draw with Italy. This is an awkward situation for the FA and yesterday they were reluctant to release another statement condemning the anti-IRA chanting as there is no evidence that it has had a positive effect. It seems by Roy Hodgson's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the England boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans' behaviour . The first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to Celtic Park in November, when England emerged with an uplifting 3-1 victory over Scotland. Life felt good. That was until Hodgson, underprepared for a question about the nature of the chants, answered one with some assistance from a diplomatic member of the FA\u2019s communications team. The FA attempted to defuse the situation by releasing a statement the following day apologising for the behaviour of \u2018a section of the England support\u2019. It read: \u2018We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective.\u2019 The songs were sung in England's win against Scotland and the FA wanted to make sure they stopped in Turin\u00a0- there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . The FA are in a tricky position because they are getting hammered by the travelling fans at every away game for the \u2018two caps for Wembley\u2019 loyalty scheme. Previously, those who travelled to watch England were rewarded with double the \u2018caps\u2019, giving greater access to restricted-allocation European Championship and World Cup tickets. Now, fans who attend home games get twice the points instead. The FA would do well to take a closer look at this policy in an effort to placate the supporters. Is it a fair trade? Probably not, but then it isn\u2019t equitable to inflict anti-IRA songs on the people of Ireland the day before kick-off at the Aviva Stadium, either.",

Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson (left) has been involved in a number of controversial incidents this season . However, West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has defended Pearson and says that he is 'his own man' In February, Pearson was involved in an altercation with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur . It has added to speculation Pearson will be sacked by Leicester with the club sitting bottom of the Barclays Premier League, but Allardyce feels his former colleague has done an 'unbelievable job'. 'He's his own man. He has his own methods and believes in not only himself but what he is doing,' Allardyce said. 'Occasionally as we all get under pressure, we may make odd comments or the odd mistake, but we're human beings like everybody else. 'He's done an unbelievable job, not just at Leicester but as a manager.' Leicester are seven points from safety, albeit with a game in hand against leaders Chelsea, but Allardyce feels Pearson will be frustrated because their performances do not warrant their lowly position. Leicester defender Robert Huth (centre) in action during the club's session at\u00a0Belvoir Drive Training Ground . 'I think overall Nigel must be pulling out his hair,' Allardyce added. 'Why have those performances not given them more results? That's the cruciality of the Premier League. 'On occasion his team have been in the ascendency. They have not taken advantage of it by not scoring or converting chances. They've paid the ultimate price in the end. That's this level for you. 'There are critical moments and if you don't take them, they're very costly indeed. Performances are always important, but in the end it's a results business.' West Ham scored with their only two shots on target against Leicester when they beat them 2-0 in December, and Pearson will try to end a goal-drought at the King Power Stadium that is five hours and 15 minutes long.

The nauseating footage was captured on a camera phone at a school in Portland, Oregon, and shows the well-built man lecturing a crowd of students before excitedly asking 'everybody ready?'. The teacher then orders the class to give him a count as he hoists the axe up over his head and swings it directly into the unlucky fellow-teacher's crotch - causing him to squirm violently on the floor. Facing the axe: The well-built teacher tells his class about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block before hoisting the implement into the air and swinging it straight on to the helpless teenager's groin . Ouch! This is the teacher's face the moment after he was stuck in the crotch by the blunt end of the axe. Amazingly, his co-worker stepped up and immediately took a second swing . Unmasked: The teacher, seen here after the second axe blow shattered the cinder block, seems to be hurting from the bed of nails he was holding to his chest - rather than to hit to his groin . The idea of the experiment appears to be to crack open a cinder block that is balancing on the chest of one of his co-workers using the blunt end of the axe. Standing with his legs astride over the teacher, he swings the tool over his head but completely misses his target. The man appears to be wearing face protection but has not thought to cover his groin area and is seen writhing on impact just before the 17-second clip cuts out. Uploaded to YouTube, the video has been titled: 'How the physics teacher lost his job.' No pain, no gain: As his class of pupils watch in anticipation, the teacher misses his target and brings the blunt end of the axe directly down on to the teacher's genitals before the clip cuts out . Another hit: The teacher with the axe immediately took a second swing and crushed the cinder block . However, teenager Haneef Mubarak says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out OK. Mubarak, who says he is a student in the class, posted a second video and revealed that the unfortunate man holding the cinder block was actually the teacher of the AP Physics class at a high school in Portland. The new clip shows the teacher with the axe actually take a second swing at the block, even as his coworker writhes in pain on the floor. The teacher is actually holding the cinder block on his check on top of a bed of nails. The experiment was meant to show that the nails would not pierce the teacher because the force was evenly distributed, Mubarak wrote on Reddit. The new video shows the teacher get up and dust himself off. He appeared to have more pain in his chest, where he took the second hit, than his in groin. 'He got up and resumed teaching after the demo was over. Looked uncomfortable, but ya gotta do what ya gotta do,' Mubarak said.",

An early strike from Neymar and second-half brace from Luis Suarez sealed victory for Barcelona and placed the Catalan outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Blanc admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended Marco Verratti and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while PSG were also unable to start with David Luiz and saw Thiago Silva hobble off in the early stages. Luis Suarez eases past David Luiz en route to scoring his second goal of the Champions League tie . Gerard Pique leads the celebrations after Barcelona secured a 3-1 victory in Paris on Wednesday night . 'I'm not going to make excuses about us being depleted,' said Blanc. 'I'm not doing that. We put a team out there, but we were dominated by Barcelona. 'It's only six days until the second leg, with a league game in between, so it's a 'short week' for people to recover. I think Barcelona were fitter than us. We had players who weren't at 100 per cent, and also a lot of absentees, but that should have been a motivation for us. We never controlled the ball well enough, and Barca were better than us in virtually every department. 'We will have the suspended players back next week, and that is an incentive. We'll try and put on a better show than we did tonight. They were better than us tonight and scored three goals. We'll try and show a different PSG at Barcelona next week. Hopefully we will achieve a different result.' Laurent Blanc made no excuses for his side as they now face elimination from the Champions League . David Luiz, who started the game from the substitutes' bench, endured a night to forget in the French capital . In the end, the Frenchman was relieved to escape only 3-1 down. 'It didn't end up as bad as it might have done, but the players are very disappointed with the way it went,' he said. 'We gave the impression we gave Barcelona the kind of game they wanted to pay. They made life difficult for us on the counter-attack and have players who can be very dangerous.' Barcelona manager Luis Enrique was delighted with his side's showing and reserved special praise for Suarez. 'Suarez is special in his own way,' Enrique said, 'Look at the goals he scored for Ajax and Liverpool. He is very strong and finishes so well. But it wasn't just about Luis Suarez tonight. We were superb in defence, midfield and attack.'",

But after fierce competition and testing, experts have ruled the the best breakfast is available from your local Morrisons. The supermarket beat major hotel, restaurant and pub chains to achieve the title of Britain's Best Breakfast. Morrisons has been named the best place to get breakfast in the UK - beating restaurants, pubs and hotels to win the title - with its Big Breakfast (pictured) one of the most popular items on its extensive morning menu . It was picked out by judges of the Menu Innovation and Development Awards (MIDAS) for its value for money, food quality and customer satisfaction. Richard Jones, Morrisons Head Chef, said: 'The Great British breakfast is a national institution, so to be voted the nation's best is an honour. 'The secret of our success is offering shoppers a good selection of fresh breakfast items to please all tastes - granola and porridge have become very popular in recent times, and of course there's nothing like the breakfast of champions, the Full English.' The supermarket chain offers a variety of breakfasts from porridge with red berries to its infamous Big Breakfast for \u00a34.50. Morrisons was named best in the breakfast category, beating Wetherspoons and Bella Italia which were shortlisted for the awards. Last year the award went to Intercontinental Hotels which charges \u00a328 for its cooked breakfast at its 5-star London Park Lane hotel. And the year before Macdonald Hotels won the accolade. A full English at its 4-star Macdonald Manchester Hotel and Spa costs \u00a319.50 . Mystery shoppers tried breakfasts at restaurants, pubs and hotels nationwide to name Morrisons the winner . The MIDAS awards were launched to recognise the efforts of food development managers in major restaurant and food service chains, and previous winners include\u00a0the Marriott and InterContinental hotel groups. As part of the judging process organisers send a team of 'mystery shoppers' to try the breakfast menu at all competing venues - from croissants and bacon rolls to the Full English. They then score each menu in terms of value for money, food quality and customer expectation levels. Morrisons' 400 in-store cafes, which serve breakfast until 4pm. Nationwide they sell 100,000 Big Breakfasts a week, and also stock vegetarian options. Morrison's nationwide sell around 10,000 of their signature 'Big Breakfast' a week. This has: . 3 x rashers of British Market St. Bacon . 1 x British Market St. Sausage . 1 x Egg (choice of Fried, Scrambled or Poached) 2 x Hash Browns . Heinz Baked Beanz . Mushrooms . Fried Tomato . Fried Bread . Served with red or brown sauce . Simon Peat, of award organisers Inside Foodservice, said: 'Our judges were dispatched to three Morrisons across the country, to try the full range of items on the menu, and they scored top marks each time. Morrisons is the best place for breakfast. 'As the saying goes, breakfast is the most important meal of the day - and there's lot of prestige within the industry to be named as the home of the best breakfast in the UK.' British breakfast staples have enjoyed a boost in popularity recently - with sales of British back bacon and eggs increasing. In 2013 British bacon producers exported over \u00a333million worth of the meat to nearly 70 countries, with another \u00a31.3million worth of black pudding sold to foreign countries including Spain, Ireland and Norway. Eggs were exported to 57 countries.",

Activists in the Missouri suburb, protesting over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop, were also known as 'adversaries', according to internal briefings seen by CNN\u00a0this week. The National Guard was first activated in Ferguson in August after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency when riots and looting broke out amid peaceful demonstrations over police brutality. National Guard soldiers secure the police command center in Ferguson, Missouri, on November 27 last year. An internal report has revealed that the heavily-militarized guard referred to  protesters as 'enemy forces' The guard were activated again in November ahead of the November 24 decision by a St Louis grand jury who decided not to indict the officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. Many in the community accused the National Guard of making an already tense situation worse. Guardsmen were seen rolling through the streets of the suburb in tanks wearing combat gear and carrying assault rifles. Missouri National Guard described some  on the streets as 'enemy forces' including the KKK, the RgB Black Rebels and the New Black Panther Party - \u00a0but also the 'general protesters'. According to CNN, National Guard supervisors were worried about how they were being viewed by the public and asked guardsmen to tone down the heavily militarized language. Officers were told by superiors to change references to 'enemy' to 'criminal elements' instead. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a response from the Missouri National Guard on Friday. Brown's shooting stirred long-simmering racial tensions in the St. Louis suburb, where two-thirds of the residents are black but the police force is almost entirely white. Rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily-armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions. At times, protesters lobbed rocks and Molotov cocktails at police, who fired tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse crowds. At the time of the Guard's deployment in November,\u00a0St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said he supported Nixon's decision to activate the Guard. 'The way we view this, the Guard is not going to be confronting the protesters and will not be on (the) front line interacting directly with demonstrators,' Slay said. Protesters flip over a Ferguson police car on November 25, 2014. Missouri's governor ordered hundreds more National Guard troops to the St Louis suburb following the grand jury's decision not to indict white cop Darren Wilson over the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown .",

The woman in her mid- to late 30s, who is believed to have had two or three children participating, was at Melbourne\u2019s Greatest Ever Easter Egg Hunt, which was run by Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation at\u00a0Caulfield Racecourse on Saturday. She was escorted out of the racecourse, in Melbourne's south-east, when she became 'irate' after a young volunteer at the hunt asked her to stop taking so many Easter eggs. Scroll down for video . A greedy mother at a charity Easter egg hunt was booted out of the event after she swore at volunteers . Event organiser Allan Turner said gluttonous parents were a major problem at the event who took in additional bags and even prams to fill up with chocolate. The aim of the hunt is to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation, while raising money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation. More than 2,500 chocolate lovers paid $5 to fill up their bucket with as many eggs as they could fit on Saturday. 'This is the fourth year we've done the event and we have problems with parents sneaking in shopping bags and filling them up to the top,' Mr Turner told Daily Mail Australia. She was told by a 13-year-old volunteer she was taking too many eggs and she told the young person to 'f*** off' The woman kept denying she was smuggling eggs into additional plastic bags she had brought in . 'Parents are the toughest ones to control. You expect the kids to go frantic and shove eggs into their pockets and shirts and pants. But when parents go past this level of gluttony, it\u2019s not a good look.' Mr Turner said they had to create a pram parking area outside the hunting spot to stop adults from smuggling eggs out by hiding them inside baby carriages. But he said this was the first year he had security guards escort a parent off site because they were taking too many of the 250,000 eggs donated by Hillier's Chocolates. He said one of volunteers approached him on the day and told him a woman was throwing obscenities at her when they asked her to stop stuffing multiple bags full with treats. '[The woman] was saying \"I've not done it\"... [but] she had definitely filled up a number of bags to the hilt, more than people paying $5 a bucket,' Mr Turner said. 'She got irate and started carrying on and started having a go at my young volunteer who was only 13 years old. 'She was using the f-word, saying \"You can't stop from f***ing doing this and f*** off\".' It was not the first time parents took more than their fair share - which is a $5 bucket full - but this is the first time organisers have had to kick someone out . The egg hunt looks to raise money for Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation, which helps bring awareness of tissue and organ donation to the forefront . It was started by Zaidee Turner's father, Allan, who wanted to honour his seven-year-old daughter who was an organ donor when she died . Mr Turner said it was a shame this woman had acted in this way as she was at a family event, which he had started in the honour of his daughter, Zaidee, who died of a brain anuerysm when she seven years old. He said Zaidee's Rainbow Foundation tried to raise awareness of organ and tissue donation. At the time of her death, Mr Turner said Zaidee was one of the youngest people in Victoria to be on the donor list, saving the lives of up to seven people. Zaidee (not pictured) died of a brain aneurysm in 2004 and she has been remembered through the hunt . Mr Turner said parents were often the most difficult to control at these hunts as they were scrambling to get as many eggs as possible . Organisers have had to stop parents bringing prams because they were using them to smuggle out eggs . 'We try to [do events] left of field for organ and tissue donation,' he said. 'We've had jockey breeches with rainbow stripes on the side, we've done that for a number of years where [jockeys] wear them at race events and we came up with the idea of Melbourne's Greatest Easter Egg Hunt. 'It's Melbourne\u2019s biggest Easter egg hunt and it raises much needed funds in an area where there are benefits for young and old.'",

The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14\u00a0Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino\u2019s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. \u2018He deserved it,\u2019 he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. \u2018He has the quality,\u2019 he said. \u2018So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).\u2019 Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week. Here at Turf Moor, though, the dream and the reality were not quite in tandem for once, Kane enduring one of the more difficult afternoons he has experienced this season alongside team-mates unable to provide him with the service he requires. \u2018It was difficult for him and difficult for his team-mates too,\u2019 Pochettino acknowledged. He also pointed to Manchester City\u2019s recent defeat here and complained that \u2018long balls into the box\u2019 made Sean Dyche\u2019s side hard to play against. But Tottenham played like a side that took one look at Arsenal\u2019s thumping defeat of Liverpool on Saturday and concluded that a place in the Champions League was already beyond their reach. They lacked urgency as well as energy, and while Pochettino could point to illness, injury and the international commitments of his players it remained a disappointing display. \u2018Maybe we like playing on Thursday nights??\u2019 tweeted Darren Anderton.

Kyle Walker receives treatment on the pitch before he was forced off through injury and replaced by Ben Davies for Tottenham . Walker was forced off through injury in the second half as Tottenham chased the win against Burnley at Turf Moor . Tottenham had only two shots on target in this game \u2014 they have only managed fewer three times in Premier League games this season. It remained more than a little perplexing that Pochettino waited until the 83rd minute to unleash Andros Townsend from the bench. The scorer of England\u2019s equaliser against Italy and probably full of confidence as a result, he might have injected some much-needed momentum into Tottenham\u2019s football. As it was he once again found himself the target of Paul Merson\u2019s venom, the former Arsenal midfielder teasing him on Twitter that he must have missed the bus. Dyche focused more on the positives of his own team\u2019s efforts but should really see this as a missed opportunity, given how poor Tottenham were. A point would have been welcome but three would have lifted them out of the relegation places, and on reflection his side had the best of the chances. Danny Ings squandered a marvellous opportunity in the opening few minutes before forcing a fine one-handed save from Michel Vorm shortly before the interval. The fact that the first booking came in the 78th minute illustrated how timid a contest this was. Even after Dyche had taken the fairly bold step of starting with Ings, Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes. This game boasted the two hardest working players in the Premier League this season, with George Boyd top of that list with 338.8km covered and Christian Eriksen second, just 600m behind the Burnley midfielder.

It was Boyd\u2019s industry that created the first decent chance of the game, the pressure he applied on Ryan Mason forcing the newly capped England player into directing a back-pass into the path of Ings. The Burnley striker should have scored but succeeded only in firing his shot straight at Vorm. The second half was no better. Eriksen burst clear only to send a shot well over the crossbar, while Barnes threatened too. Paulinho found himself clean through at one stage only to scuff his effort embarrassingly wide. And the irrepressible Boyd would go close moments before the final whistle only to see his header bounce agonisingly wide. \u2018I think we edged the game,\u2019 said Dyche afterwards. \u2018Danny (Ings) has had a couple of great chances but the first one he\u2019s probably just hit too cleanly. But I\u2019m pleased by the fact that we\u2019ve got another clean sheet against a team that has spent a couple of hundred million on players.\u2019 Not that there was much evidence of that here.

The brothers were recently the subject of a mix-up involving Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho prior to the Blues' crunch clash with United at Stamford Bridge on April 18. Following his side's 1-0 victory over Louis van Gaal's side, Mourinho revealed he prepared his Chelsea players to deal with the threat of Fellaini all week \u2013 only to be told by a hotel doorman that the Belgian was not playing. Marouane Fellaini (left) and his twin brother Mansour share a glass of bubbly in Manchester . Following Manchester United's 3-0 loss against Everton,\u00a0Fellaini spent Tuesday chilling out with his brother . Fellaini was substituted at half-time against the Toffees as Louis van Gaal's side struggled at Goodison Park . Mourinho planned for Kurt Zouma to man mark Fellaini - with teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek playing the 6ft 4in midfielder in training. But he feared his tactical master plan was set to be for nothing when he was told that the United powerhouse was not playing by the doorman at the club's hotel. Mourinho, relaying his conversation with the doorman, said: 'Fellaini doesn't play because he was here to get tickets for the game from Eden Hazard. He was dressed in jeans, this and that'. Fellaini competes for possession with Everton midfielder Gareth Barry on Sunday . Fellaini, following a strong season in the red shirt, struggled to impose himself on the contest at Goodison . '(It) didn't smell well for me. I go to Google and I put 'Fellaini brother'. 'So I go with the pictures to the doorman. I say 'hey, this one or this one?' And he looks 'this one'. 'He's the brother'.' Mourinho said the other Fellaini - his twin brother Mansour - posed for photos as the United player, who had been in the Blues boss' thoughts all week, did start the game at Stamford Bridge.

Fellaini, who has emerged a key figure in Van Gaal's new-look United outfit this season, was substituted at half-time against the Toffees. United crashed to a 3-0 defeat against Roberto Martinez's men with James McCarthy, John Stones and Kevin Mirallas\u00a0all getting on the scoresheet. The Red Devils, who are currently fourth in the Premier League table, welcome West Brom to Old Trafford on Saturday. In the end, Fellaini did play at Stamford Bridge earlier this month, but was dealt with in midfield by Kurt Zouma . Zouma (right) had been given a specific tactical brief to stifle the threat of Fellaini during the game .",

The three men were stopped from boarding a plane to Istanbul with Hamza Ahmed, 19, at JFK Airport after riding on a Greyhound bus with him from Minneapolis to New York in November.

Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury . It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries . Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time. Leeds were not available for comment.",

Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty\u2019s Spring Heeled in the Crabbie\u2019s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner, who was pulled up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the \u00a31million race. But the champion trainer  said on Wednesday it was unfair to tie Scholfield down to a gelding which is far from certain to run when the mount on another leading definite contender is being offered.

Nicholls said: \u2018I have not made up my mind if I am going to run Sam Winner yet and Nick needed a decision. \u2018I did not want to get into a situation next week when I had to say \"sorry mate, he is not running\" and did not want to stop him getting a good ride. \u2018I have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at Cheltenham. That will happen over the weekend and early next week. I don\u2019t want to run unless I am really happy. \u2018I have plenty of other lads who could ride Sam Winner if he runs and would not be afraid to use Will Biddick or Harry Skelton.\u2019 Spring Heeled (right) wins the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at Cheltenham last year . Spring Heeled, winner of Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at last season\u2019s Cheltenham Festival, has been given a National preparation. The eight-year-old has run only once since finishing fourth to Road To Riches in the Galway Plate in July when he was fourth of five in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February. Racemail revealed on Wednesday that Culloty would have two runners in the National. Robbie McNamara will ride his 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere. Scholfield rides Teaforthree (front) as the horse jumps the last fence at Aintree in the 2013 Grand National . McNamara said: \u2018It's a great ride to get and I'm looking forward to it. I've ridden him before in a Grade One in Leopardstown and I was supposed to ride him in the Hennessy there as well, but I broke my collarbone the day before. I'm delighted to get back on him.\u2019 With Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Double Ross another confirmed non runner, David Pipe\u2019s well supported Soll appears guaranteed a run at the bottom of the weights.

A statement posted on the NBC News site said: 'The group that kidnapped us put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite Shabiha militiamen.\u00a0The group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances.' The statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight, as they were told, this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes.

'This, of course, does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous. It does, however, underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside Syria.' Mr Engel and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the New York Times raised questions over the attackers' identities. They suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a Sunni criminal element of the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army and known for taking hostages. The New York Times claimed that NBC executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers' identities during and after Mr Engel was taken. Mr Engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces . But immediately after his release Mr Engel appeared on Today and in a Vanity Fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group, government militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. He made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors, which included that they had been rescued by Sunni rebels. The paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the Assad regime. Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra, were taken hostage on December 13, 2012, while reporting in Syria. The foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a Syrian rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see Iranian and Lebanese prisoners being held by rebels. Syrians run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the Bustan Al-Qasr district of Aleppo . They were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound, blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes. The kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress GPS signal, which informed NBC exactly where they were. \u00a0NBC was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world, also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location. Engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall behind them. It read: \u2018Or will burn.\u2019 A statement published by NBC said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes . During the five days they were held Mr Engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot, and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last. He claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers.\u00a0As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. On the fifth night they were loaded, while blindfolded, into a van. They were told they would be handed over to military forces in  Foua. As they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor. Engel has since said, in light of the new information, this may have been staged to convince them they were rescued rather than handed over. Engel, who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's chief foreign correspondent in 2008.",

Jessa, 22, and her 19-year-old husband Ben   announced the\u00a0the news of their pregnancy ina video for\u00a0TLC.com, which featured them both\u00a0making health smoothies, and Jessa has revealed that one of the first things the couple considered after hearing the news was how to adjust her workouts accordingly, to ensure that she can remain fit and active while expecting. Speaking to People magazine, the reality star explained that when it comes to exercising: 'I'm just trying not to overdo it right now. I am still working out, but not trying to break any records. Scroll down for video . Expecting: Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald recently revealed that she is pregnant with their first child . Announcement: The baby is due on November 1, which is also the date of Ben and Jessa's first wedding anniversary . 'I want to gain a little less weight and not stress out about it. I do want to make sure that I'm eating healthy. You are eating for two but the other is, like, a speck. I am trying to make healthy choices now that I'm entering my second trimester.' The pair, who married after a chaste courtship, are well-known for their health-conscious lifestyle and are often seen on the Duggars\u2019 hit reality series enjoying healthy dinners or working out together, something which viewers saw frequently during the build-up to the couple\u2019s wedding, during which time Jessa was incredibly keen to trim down her already-toned physique. A recent episode of the show even saw Jessa pushing Ben's truck down the road while wearing workout pants covered with knee-length skirts to maintain their 'standard of modesty'. Jessa also frequently posts recipes and photos of healthy foods she's trying out on Instagram. Juiced up: Jessa and Ben are both champions of healthy eating, and even announced their pregnancy in an adorable video while making smoothies . Push it along: While getting ready for her wedding, Jessa stepped up her workout, part of which involved pushing her fiance's truck down a dirt road with her siblings inside . Interesting attire: The women in the religious Duggar family wear skirts over their workout pants to maintain their 'standard of modesty' As for her pregnancy diet, when Jessa discovered the news, she said that she thought she would take after other Duggar mothers when it came to her pregnancy cravings, but admitted that this hasn\u2019t been the case. 'I am feeling pretty good,' she added to People. 'I thought I'd crave pickles and lemons because my mother did, but I couldn't stand them. 'I'm hoping I'm having triplets because I've been eating so much!' However, Jessa does admit she will be looking to her older sister Jill for advice, as the 23-year-old just welcomed a son Israel with husband Derick Dillard on April 6, and is also a trained midwife. Jill kept up her exercise during the later months of pregnancy by\u00a0walking on the treadmill while listening to sermons. 70 hours later: Jessa's sister Jill Dillard (pictured) welcomed her son Israel on April 6 with her husband Derick after almost three full days of labor . Busy 2015 for the Duggars: Three women in the family were pregnant at once including Jill Dillard (l), Jessa (r) and their older brother Josh's wife Anna (c) Ben and Jessa plan to hire a midwife and have the baby at home, but understand that things do not always go to plan. Jessa added that she is not dwelling on the intense 70-hour labor her sister Jill went through earlier this month, insisting that 'Every birth story is unique.' The baby, who is due on Jessa and Ben's one year wedding anniversary, will be the sixth grandchild for Jessa's parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar after Jill's new addition and eldest Duggar son Josh's three children young and one more expected in June. Ben, who has worked in property maintenance for Duggar patriarch Jim Bob and has aspirations to enter the ministry, has apparently been waiting on his wife 'hand and foot'.",

Families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers. Around 30 per cent of teachers said they had been the subject of parents\u2019 abusive internet posts. A study of 1,500 teachers found 30 per cent have suffered online abuse by parents - and that this type of bullying is on the rise accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year . And the poll found that bullying by parents is on the rise, accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year compared to just 27 per cent last year. The survey, by teachers\u2019 union NASUWT, reveals a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. One teacher said they had been sworn at by a parent online over a PE lesson, while a female dance teacher said she had been called a \u2018paedophile\u2019 for wanting to film a performance. Others said they had received insults from parents about their appearance and weight, with one told she was ugly and her \u2018husband could do better than her\u2019. Of those harassed online by parents, 15 per cent had threats made against them, compared to seven per cent in 2014. The poll  also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year . Around eight per cent saw allegations of inappropriate behaviour with students, six per cent saw videos or photos taken without consent and three per cent were told they had behaved inappropriately towards parents. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year \u2013 increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: \u2018It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.\u2019 He added: \u2018The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers\u2019 health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.\u2019 The survey found that many teachers had received racist, sexist and homophobic remarks online \u2013 with one teacher called a \u2018wog\u2019 by a pupil and others called \u2018lesbian\u2019 and \u2018slut\u2019. And teachers said that 60 per cent of the abusive comments online had been written by pupils. Over half of the pupils responsible for abuse were aged between 14 and 16, while 38 per cent were aged between 11 and 14, the teachers\u2019 poll found. One teacher received the comment \u2018I hope she gets cancer\u2019, while a heavily pregnant worker was sworn at, called \u2018fat whore\u2019 and \u2018ugly\u2019. Another said they had been harassed for seven months by pupils who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in their name. A number of teachers reported pupils had used their identity to set up bogus Facebook profiles and post sexually inappropriate messages. One man only found out months afterwards and feared it could be used to \u2018smear him\u2019 and destroy his career. Just under a third of bullied teachers did not report the incidents to their school or to police. Mrs Keates went on to say: \u2018While there has been some improvement in action taken on reported abuse, there are still too many cases where no appropriate action is taken and teachers are being left devastated, humiliated and traumatised.\u2019 The union called for the next government to require schools to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to online abuse and use all sanctions available to address any bullying of staff. Some of the most disturbing examples of online abuse from parents include: . A female attacked by parents for her appearance and the size of her nose. She was told she was \u2018ugly\u2019 and \u2018her husband could do better\u2019. Another was called \u2018rubbish\u2019, with a mother incorrectly claiming that she had \u2018tried to kill her daughter\u2019 by making her do PE without an inhaler. A parent posted comments saying that a female dance teacher was \u2018a paedophile\u2019 for videoing performances. A teacher was sworn at and told he was \u2018pathetic\u2019 for asking a pupil to replace equipment he had broken. Family members falsely accused a teacher of having sex with pupils \u2013 making him fear for his career.",

The splatters of blood on the checklist for the very first US spacewalk were from an astronaut as he frantically battled to close the hatch door of the spacecraft after a historic venture. But the Gemini 4 mission of June 1965 ultimately proved successfully, and paved the way to astronauts walking on the moon for the first time four years later. A complete 13-page checklist, including a bloodstained document seen at the front), from the Gemini 4 mission in June 1965 is tipped to sell for a huge \u00a380,000 ($120,000). The list shows the various steps the astronauts had to go through when opening and closing the hatch to space . Gemini 4 launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board. One, Ed White, was tasked with performing the first US spacewalk, less than three months after Soviet Alexey Leonov had completed the first spacewalk in history. The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White. The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, lifted off Launch Pad 19 at Cape Canaveral in Florida on March 23, 1965. Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. They also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft. All were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to Earth. They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. He spent 20 minutes in space on the spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), before having to come back in, which he said was 'the saddest moment of my life'. But the hatch to get out had proved difficult to open and it was equally difficult to close when White was back inside. It's thought one of them cut their hand or finger on the hatch locking mechanism and their blood ended up on the checklist after they removed their gloves while safely inside. Had the pair not been able to lock the hatch after themselves, they wouldn't have been able to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and would have been lost in space. And had that worse case scenario happened, it could easily have scuppered the Apollo missions that followed including the first of the moon landings four years later in 1969. Edward White, pictured, became the first US astronaut to perform a spacewalk on 3 June 1965. He spent 20 minutes in space, and said coming back in was 'the saddest moment of my life'. As it was the first spacewalk, there were a number of complications. White used a small jet propulsion unit to move around in space . The two astronauts on the Gemini 4 mission were Jim McDivitt and Ed White.\u00a0They orbited Earth 66 times over four days and, on the first day, Ed White donned a spacesuit and drifted out of the cramped capsule. Shown is the first page of the checklist (left) and the Suit Integrity Check (right) for the spacecraft . The Gemini programme of the 1960s was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the Apollo missions. On the left is part of the checklist used for leaving the spacecraft, and on the right, part of the checks the astronaut leaving had to go through . Nasa's two-man Gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule's orbit, remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft. Pictured is the later Gemini 7 in orbit, as seen from Gemini 6 during a rendezvous mission in December 1965 . Checklists from space missions are said to be highly collectable items because they flew in space and were so vital to the astronauts. The spacewalk checklist for the Gemini 4 mission of 1965 belonged to McDivitt who gave it to a friend after signing it many years ago. The document is now being sold at auction to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic mission. Cassandra Hatton, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the item, said: 'The Gemini 4 mission was the first time [an American] walked in space and it was a huge step in the development of the space programme. Gemini 4 (pictured) launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on 3 June 1965 with two astronauts on board . Shown are astronauts Edward H. White II (left) and James A. McDivitt, command pilot for Gemini 4 . 'We knew we could get into space but until this point we didn't know if we could walk and float around out there. Jim McDivitt and Ed White's achievement is second only to landing on the moon. 'The checklist was vital for making sure things didn't go wrong and they didn't get sucked out into space. 'They had a difficult time in getting back in the capsule afterwards as the hatch got stuck. There was a problem with the latch on the hatch. It was a really scary, life or death moment. 'If they hadn't been able to get the hatch closed they would have died in space. It would have been the first major space programme disaster which could have jettisoned the whole space programme.' The auction takes place on April 24 in New York. The Gemini spacecraft (illustrated) was fairly cramped, leaving the astronauts little room to move around . This fantastic shot shows White floating above the curvature of Earth with the hatch seen open on the right .",

The actress is selling the Manhattan penthouse she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis with an asking price of $75million which is exactly half of her total estimated fortune of $150million. And if the penthouse sells for that much, it will break the record for the most expensive co-op apartment ever sold on the Upper West Side. Moore and Willis purchased the south tower penthouse on the 28th floor of the historic San Remo apartment building in 1990 from Saturday Night Fever producer Robert Stigwood, in addition to a two-bedroom maisonette on the lobby floor. Scroll down for video . Moving out: Demi Moore is selling the Manhattan penthouse apartment she once shared with ex-husband Bruce Willis for a $75million asking price . 'We looked at everything on the park, Fifth Avenue, Central Park South and Central Park West, and there was just nothing like it,' Moore told the New York Times of her house search. 'The location, architecture and history of the San Remo were on a completely different level.' The 14-bedroom apartment includes a 7,000 square feet of living space and wrap around terraces with views of both Central Park and the Hudson River. The couple decorated the mansion in the skies in a Southwestern mission motif, complete with cherry wood detailing and a ceramic tile fireplace. New windows have been installed in every room, the bathrooms remolded and state-of-the-art equipment like a sub-zero refrigerator and viking range installed in the kitchen. Split: The couple, pictured left in 1997, purchased the Upper West Side home in 1990. They split up in 2000, and Moore says she doesn't spend much time there anymore. Pictured on the right leaving the residence in 2005 .

The two towers of the San Remo building seen behind the Central Park Lake . The 24 by 17 foot dining room features a crystal chandelier. In the living room, the focal point are the windows which look out onto the boat pond in Central Park. The San Remo was designed in 1929 by American architect Emery Roth, and it was turned into a co-op in 1972. Over the years, Moore has counted Dustin Hoffman, Diane Keaton, Steven Spielberg as neighbors - not to mention U2 frontman Bono who occupies the north tower penthouse. Moore says she is selling the apartment and maisonette since she doesn't spend much time at the residence anymore. Adam D Modlin, president of the Modlin Group, is in charge of the listing and says there is no other apartment in the neighborhood to rival Moore's. 'Compared with the other iconic private perches on the perimeter of Central Park, there just isn\u2019t anything quite like this penthouse,' he said. 'It is the grandest residence in the south tower, the one that sits above all the others, a mansion in the clouds, and it is the largest intact park-facing residence at the San Remo with private outdoor space.' Moore and Willis were married from 1987 until 2000 and share three daughters. The combined monthly maintenance fees for both residences is more than $20,000.",

The Answer: Many of us shed a few tears over the recent Sabra hummus recall (even though we are perfectly capable of making our own at home), but that sadness quickly transformed into anxiety when we looked inside our refrigerators and saw the potentially tainted culprit sitting there on the shelf. To assuage any fears, we asked John Swartzberg, M.D., a clinical professor at the University of California at Berkeley, to walk us through the process of determining if our favorite dip was still safe to eat. Related: Amy's Kitchen Recalls More Than 70,000 Cases Of Food Due To Fear Of Listeria Contamination . The first step, according to Swartzberg, is to go to the Food and Drug Administration's website and find the official report for the recalled product you're worried about. Each report will list recalled items with their product codes, which are typically categorized by the Universal Product Code (the number adjacent to the barcode) or the Stock Keeping Unit (a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold). They will also include the recalled products' use-by dates, and the geographical areas affected. \"The recall is not based on the use-by dates, though,\" said Swartzberg. \"If the product is within the use-by date, it should still be recalled. This makes sense, because the product was contaminated prior to purchase and no matter how 'fresh' the product is, it still may be contaminated.\" After cross-checking these details, you should have a strong sense of whether your food product is safe to eat or needs to be trashed right away. But as far as avoiding potential problems before learning such details about a food recall, the consumer is at an automatic disadvantage. Related: 14 Habits Of People With A Healthy Relationship To Food . \"There's nothing the consumer can do prior to learning about the recall,\" said Dr. Swartzberg. \"Discarding or returning the product to the store is all that can be done.\" In the case of this specific hummus recall, while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness, the product's routine sample last month revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Consuming such bacteria can lead to listeriosis, a serious infection, and Dr. Swartzberg recommends that anyone who has consumed a listeria-laden food should let their physician know as soon as possible. \"Listeria survives well at cool temperatures,\" he said. \"Most bacteria and fungi do not -- that's why we refrigerate. Healthy people are at low risk for disease, but it can happen. Those at greatest risk for disease are the elderly, immunocompromised and pregnant.\" To learn more about the best food safety practices, visit UC Berkeley's Wellness website.

The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video . Australian citizen Ibrahim Jalloh (pictured) is reportedly facing drugs charges in Guangzhou province . Peter Gardner (left) and Kalynda Davis (right) were apprehended in Guangzhou. Davis was allowed to go free when charges were withdrawn but Gardner's case has been brought forward by six months . Jockey Anthony Roger Bannister (pictured) was charged with importing 3kg of methamphetamine . The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia. Another citizen, Ibrahim Jalloh and his friend Bengali Sherrif were arrested at Guangzhou Airport in July over alleged drug crimes. Sherrif is reported to have been granted a suspended death sentence and Jalloh has not yet faced trial, according to the ABC.\u00a0Other names have not been released. Do you know more? Daniel.Piotrowski@mailonline.com . Drug ring? Many of those facing death row were trying to import or export the drug 'ice' into or out of Guangzhou. Pictured above is Guangzhou International Airport . The confidential DFAT briefing concerned Gardner and his then-girlfriend, Penrith woman Kalynda Davis. Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said. The Gardner family has requested privacy and won't comment to the media while the case proceeds. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister was approached for comment but was unavailable to respond by Daily Mail Australia's deadline. A spokesman for Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said Australia should lead efforts against the death penalty, 'in particular working with the United Nations'.

The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video . A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs . Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ . While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as\u00a0North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem .",

Nina Anderson searched pawn shops near her house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces worth nearly \u00a3400 were taken from her bedroom as she watched television. The great-grandmother, who lives with husband Maurice, 75, eventually spotted two of the stolen items in the window of a Cash and Cheque Express in the city centre two months after the raid. Her actions, which echo those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, led to the arrest of burglar Martin Campbell, who has now been jailed for three years. Detective: Nina Anderson, pictured with husband Maurice, 75, searched pawn shops near their house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces  were taken from her bedroom as she watched TV . Real-life Miss Marple: Mrs Anderson's (left with her husband) actions mirror those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, who was played on ITV by actress Geraldine McEwan (right) between 2004 and 2007 . Portsmouth Crown Court heard Campbell, who had been hired to do odd jobs for the couple, forced his way into the  house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone on December 28. He was arrested by police when Mrs Anderson noticed necklaces missing from her jewellery box, but was later released with no further action. Determined to retrieve her stolen jewellery, Mrs Anderson began looking in nearby pawn shops. She spotted \u00a0two of the missing necklaces in the window of a branch of Cash and Cheque Express on February 19. The pawn shop was able to provide a bank statement, photo ID and ownership declaration that Campbell, 28, had provided when he sold the jewellery. Mrs Anderson contacted the police, who used the records to re-arrest Campbell. Mrs Anderson's actions mirror those of  Miss Marple, a fictional character who appears in 12 of Agatha Christie's novels, solving difficult crimes with her shrewd intelligence. Breaking in: Campbell forced his way into the house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone. Above, the damage done to the door during the raid . She said: 'I left copies of the stolen gold in pawn shops around the city. 'I found myself looking in the windows every time I passed by. Then this time something caught my eye - it was my silver necklace. 'It took my work to do it, otherwise we wouldn't have heard anything.' Prosecutor Martyn Booth told Portsmouth Crown Court: 'The police had effectively concluded their investigations. Thankfully the Andersons had conducted their own enquiries. 'Enquiries established that the defendant had turned up on December 30 two days after the burglary trying to sell the items.' An 18ct gold necklace with an image of St Anthony that Mrs Anderson's late father gave to her when she left Italy in 1957 is still missing. Mrs Anderson said she had treated Campbell like 'one of the family' when she hired him as a handyman and that the burglary was a 'great betrayal'. She said: 'We can't trust anybody, I'm locking myself in. I've been through quite a lot, I've been traumatised. I've had to go to the doctors to get sleeping tablets.' Barry McElduff, defending, handed a letter to the judge written by Campbell apologising to the Andersons. Mr McElduff said: 'He accepts full responsibility for he offences. He expresses remorse and shame. Temptation got the better of him.' The father-of-one has had 24 court appearances for 40 offences, including previous burglaries in 2002, 2003 and 2006. He admitted burglary and fraud relating to pawning the jewellery. He was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison in addition to a suspended sentence for stealing a bicycle that he was serving when he committed the crime. Link: Cristos Charalambides, franchisee of the Cash and Cheque Express where the jewellery was found, with Nina and Maurice Anderson. The pawn shop was able to provide records that traced back to Campbell . Sentencing Campbell to three years, Judge Sarah Munro QC said: 'You describe them as people with hearts of gold. 'You threw their kindness back in their faces as you did their trust in you by breaking into their home and stealing jewellery. These offences, as I hope you understand, were a great betrayal. 'They've led to a considerable detrimental effect on that couple.' The officer investigating the burglary has praised the Andersons for their detective work. He said: 'It was her integrity which led to the recovery of two items. We always encourage victims of crime to check out the normal joints, second hand shops, pawn shops.'

The punishment means they are now only one point ahead of the Championship relegation zone with two games left. Rotherham drew 1-1 with Fulham last Wednesday, which left them four points above the relegation zone .

She seems to be taking it all in stride, calling the whole thing \"ridiculous.\" \"Real beauty is quiet. Especially in this town, it's just so hard not to say, 'Oh, I need to look like that,' \" she told People. \"No, be a good person; be a good mom; do a good job with the lunch; let someone cut in front of you who looks like they're in a bigger hurry. The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying.\" The cover story focuses on Bullock's home life with her son, Louis, 5, and her efforts to stay healthy and fit past her 40s. \"I was putting him to bed and told him that even when I'm old and gray and more wrinkly than I am now, I'll still love him and want to tuck him in,\" she said. \"And he asked why I have wrinkles, and I said, 'Well, I hope some of them are from laughing so much.' And he touched my face and said, 'You're not old, you're just happy.' \" The Oscar-winning star of movies including \"Gravity,\" \"The Blind Side\" and \"Crash\" said she's happy with who she is. \"As long as I'm healthy and strong and I don't let this mind of mine run amok with insecurities about what I am not, I can look in the mirror and like who I see.\" The selection of Bullock, the oldest woman to receive top honors in the history of the list, is a sign that beauty knows no age, say some. \"Great choice!

In a new video released by the champion's 'Money Team', Mayweather's personal chef reveals that he loves his snacks, swapping healthy food for sweets and fizzy drinks on 'snack day'. 'Chef Q' fills two shopping trolleys and spends $321.43 (around \u00a3220), as she seeks to make sure she has everything her boss might want. Floyd Mayweather is down to within three-and-a-half pounds of the welterweight limit ahead of mega-fight . Mayweather's chef reveals he gets a lot of his energy from eating sweets like Twizzlers on 'snack day' 'Chef Q' told Mayweather's 'Money Team' she usually makes the champ healthy food, but not on snack day . 'Although I prepare all these organic healthy meals, today is snack day,' says the chef on camera. 'He loves his snacks! 'He usually snacks on different things, Twizzlers is his favourite thing, sometimes he may want cookies, sometimes he may want chips. 'Sometimes he just want ice tea. It's just that simple, but we gotta get what he wants, he's the champ.' As the chef picks up more snacks, including peanut M&Ms and mountains of fizzy drinks, she talks about her role in making Mayweather successful: 'We build champions around here. What would life be like without Kool-aid?'. Mayweather's chef loads the conveyor belt with snacks before spending more than $300 . The chef adds a huge pack of M&Ms to the trolley as she spends over $300 on the star's sweet selection .",

McIlroy knew he was beaten even before he  took the strain for an arm wrestle with the ripped high schooler who made short work of a strength test against the Northern Irishman. Dalke posted a video of the light-hearted encounter on his Twitter page with the note, 'Sorry Rory.' 'Look at this ... No chance,' Rory McIlroy says as he prepares to arm wrestle 17-year-old Brad Dalke . Dalke makes short work of the strength test against the world No 1 golfer who was a guest at a junior event . McIlroy is no match for Dalke, the teenager who will join Oklahoma University in the autumn . McIlroy had run a clinic and offered some inspirational words to players on Friday at a junior invitational at the Sage Valley Golf Club in Graniteville, South Carolina, sponsored by Nike. There he met Dalke and the pair agreed to an arm wrestle. As they took a knee, with elbows on a table as is customary, McIlroy couldn't help but be impressed by the 17-year-old's biceps. 'Look at this... no chance,' McIlroy laughed while poking Dalke's arm. 'I shouldn't be a golfer,' Dalke, who listed 'working out' among his interests on his 2014 Junior US Ryder Cup team profile, joked back. Oklahoma University hopes he wasn't serious having had the prodigy lined up via a verbal agreement to play for them since he was just 12 years old. McIlroy, whose long game is one of the best in golf, pumps iron in the gym . The weights work in the gym didn't help McIlroy when he came face-to-face with Dalke . Schooling the world's best golfer in an arm wrestle will do his bragging rights no harm when he arrives on campus to end the institution's five-year wait for him to come of age this year. Dalke will join the Sooners after graduating a year early from high school, having completed extra classes since he was a freshman (the equivalent of year nine in the UK). He told Golf Week last year that it was a 'dream come true' when he was told he'd be able to ditch move into college early. 'It's the only place I wanted to go,' Dalke said. - 2008 Drive, Chip and Putt National Champion . - US Kids World Champion in 2010 . - Committed verbally to Oklahoma University at the age of 12. - Won the 2011 AJGA Thunderbird International Junior. - American Junior Golf Association First Team All-American in 2011, 2012 and 2013 . - Member of the USA team that won a fourth successive Junior Ryder Cup in 2014 at Blairgowrie Golf Club. - Tied for third in the 2014 Junior PGA Championship . - Winner of the 2013 PING Invitational . - Equalled Tiger Woods\u2019 Wyndham Cup appearances record playing from 2011 to 2014 . - Moved from home in McKinney, Texas, to Hobart, Oklahoma, where less credits are required to graduate high school. - Has a 4.0 grade point average and will begin university at Oklahoma a year early after picking up extra credits since he was a freshman. Dalke is a talented junior golfer and was a member of Team USA when they won the 2014 Junior Ryder Cup . Dalke celebrates the USA's fourth successive Junior Ryder Cup win\u00a0Blairgowrie Golf Club . Dalke committed to Oklahoma University at age 12 and has finished high school a year early to join them . Getting one over one of the greats of the game could also give Dalke a confidence boost that he's been in need of on the course after hitting a disappointing 85 in the first round at Sage Valley. He shared his frustration with his Twitter following of less than 2,000, a number that is sure to grow. 'Really bad day of golf today. Can't wait to get through this slump, and even though it's tough to see now, I know I'll be stronger in the end,' he posted. He was right. The next day he shot a much-improved 72 and wrote: 'Way better day today. Shot a 72. Felt like a whole different person out there.'",

According to Omaha.com, Jenkins told his attorney about the incident in a phone call from his cell in Omaha, Nebraska. It comes amid the 28-year-old's ongoing appeal that he is mentally unstable and therefore ineligible to face the death penalty. Jenkins was jailed exactly one year ago for shooting dead four people in 10 days after being released from prison. During his murder trial in Douglas County, Jenkins was assessed by a doctor who concluded that he was 'a psychopath' and 'one of the most dangerous people' he had ever encountered. 'Psychopath': The 28-year-old, who a doctor described as 'one of the most dangerous people' he had ever encountered, may use the botched case of self-mutilation as evidence he is mentally unstable . Jenkins pleaded not guilty, then guilty, then ineligible for trial on the grounds of insanity. However, a judge dismissed the appeals and he was sentenced to life. The decision of whether he would be sentenced to death was delayed after Jenkins revealed he had carved a swastika into his skin. Following months of delays, he will face a panel in July to decide his fate. It is believed Jenkins may use his latest botched case of self-mutilation as further evidence that he is mentally unstable.",

But new figures show that the art of washing your own car appears to be dying out in Britain with a thrid of men admitting they have never picked up a bucket or chamois leather to clean their own motor. The study also reveals that three-quarters of women never wash their own car with drivers more likely to take it to a car wash on a local forecourt. A new study has revealed that a third of men have never picked up a bucket and a chamois leather to wash their own car (file pic) The survey of 1,100 adults by vehicle leasing firm OSV, found that 31 per cent of men have never washed their own car, with only 12 per cent of those that do saying they do it regularly. Meanwhile only five per cent of those surveyed said that had ever asked their children to wash the car, as a way for them to earn extra pocket money. Factors behind the decline vary from shops now opening on a Sunday and more live football on TV, meaning more people put off the chore at the weekend. The rise of hand car washes has been blamed for a decrease in drivers washing their own cars (file pic) Other reasons given for not washing cars include the rise of hand car washes and the fact that 4x4 and off-road vehicles are too large to clean. Brits are more likely to wash their own car during the holidays as the recent Easter break saw an estimated 15 million cars cleaned by their owners. However, one in four said they only did it as an excuse to get out of the house. Cars are most likely to be washed by their owners every week in Birmingham, Chelmsford and Sheffield and least likely in Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. Audis, Toyotas and BMWs are most likely to be washed by their owners and Range Rovers, Peugeots and Mercedes least often. OSV spokesman Andrew Kirkley said: 'A lot of us remember seeing our streets full of men cleaning their cars every Sunday. It was a national tradition. 'But let's face it, we don't have as much time any more, the cars are bigger and even the kids don't seem to want to earn a bit of extra money doing it for us either. 'On top of that, there is now plenty of choice out there if you want to put the car through an automated machine or get a gang of enthusiastic guys to do it for you fairly cheaply.'",

A pair of Arctic foxes viciously fight to the death on the snow in a battle to claim a lone Vixen . The amazing scene was captured on camera by wildlife photographer Einar Gudmann, who was woken up by howling . The two foxes fought each other in bitter sub-zero temperatures after one of them had been copulating with a vixen . After emerging into the bitter sub-zero temperatures, he spotted a female and male fox copulating. But the pair weren't alone - a third Arctic fox lurked nearby. Without warning the single fox emerged and began to growl and howl at the pair. Wiggling free, the female ran for the hills while the two male foxes began to fight. Mr Gudmann said: 'The female's partner managed to grab and get a firm bite over the eye and under the jaw of the single one.

'He used this to push the single one into the sea between the rocks. Splashes went bursting into all direction and moments later the single one was completely submerged and wet. 'Heavy and wet it was obvious at this moment that he had lost the fight. Now it was no longer a matter of fighting to kill, it was a matter of survival. 'He tried to run but got no mercy from his opponent. 'He finally managed to get into a dry area on the beach where they kept fighting. Heavily wounded and soaking wet he managed to run up the snowy hill but had trouble getting over the snow-bank at the top.' The snow is whipped into the air by strong winds as one of the foxes desperately seeks shelter . One of the male foxes looks directly at Mr Gudmann's camera as it trots through the snow . Meanwhile, the victorious fox shook off the shock of the brief yet aggressive fight and began a search of its female partner which had fled to the snowy mountainside. Mr Gudmann added: 'In the distance a wounded and vanquished arctic fox struggled the last steps up the snow-bank above the beach and started to hobble up the mountain. 'He had been beaten. The cold night would probably be his last one.'",

Swafford had an 11-under 133 total at TPC Louisiana. Weekley, the first-round leader after a 64, also was 11 under with three holes left. Jason Day, ranked sixth in the world, was 5 under for the round through 14 holes, pulling him into a five-way tie for third at 10 under with Brandon de Jonge, Cameron Tringale, former Zurich champion Jerry Kelly and Daniel Berger. Tringale had a 65, and de Jonge shot 70. Kelley was on the 18th green when play was stopped, and Berger had three holes left. Hudson Swafford watches his tee shot on the 18th hole on day two at the Zurich Classic . Boo Weekley tees off on the 5th hole at TPC Louisiana in Avondale on Friday . Second-round play was scheduled to resume Saturday at 8 a.m. CDT. The field remained tightly packed with birdies seemingly harder to come by Friday. Many players cited a combination of wind, soggy turf from recent rain and thick, swampy air as reasons for the course to play even longer than usual. Six players were tied for eighth, two shots off the lead. They were Chad Campbell, Morgan Hoffman, Steven Bowditch, Justin Thomas, Chris Stroud and David Hearn. Seven more players were at 8 under, including Marc Leishman, who returned to the PGA Tour this weekend after taking a month off from golf to tend to family when his wife became gravely ill. With his wife, recovering, Leishman came to New Orleans saying he just wanted to knock off some rust and was keeping expectations low. He did a lot better than that and is now in line for a nice pay-day, given officials were estimating the cut line at four under. Swafford chips on to the 17th green before ending the day tied for the lead on 11-under . Marc Leishman (right) takes a drop after hitting into the water on the 18th hole . Leishman was at 10 under through 17 holes, putting him in position to set a TPC Louisiana record with a birdie on the par-5 18th. But after a booming drive, Leishman gambled on an aggressive second shot, using his driver on the fairway. He pushed his ball right into the water. When play was stopped, he was on the fringe, lying four, needing to sink his next shot Saturday morning to tie the course record of 62. Swafford, in only his second season on the tour, had six birdies and no bogeys during his second round, putting him in position to contend for what would be his maiden PGA Tour victory. His best finish so far is tied for eighth at the Frys.com Open last October, though his most impressive outing may have been at last month's Arnold Palmer invitational at Bay Hill, where he tied for 11th.

Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" Jama said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack . In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

Walcott has made just five starts for Arsenal this season since returning from a serious knee injury after seven months on the sidelines. And with Arsenal pursuing Raheem Sterling and Walcott's contract set to run out next summer, Wright is worried that the Gunners could stand to lose a valuable player. Theo Walcott could be on the way out of Arsenal, and Gunners legend Ian Wright says that would be 'a shame' Wright enjoys Walcott as a player and hinted that he would like to see the winger stay at the club . Walcott started up front for England against Italy on Tuesday but his appearances have been limited this year . 'It's a shame for him, and the fact that people are talking about him maybe moving on if someone else comes in makes me quite sad,' he said. 'I really like him at Arsenal but he's got massive decisions to make in the next few months.' Wright also believes the England wideman, who was played in a central role for his country in Italy on Tuesday night, should have been moved into a similar position for his Arsenal. Walcott's pace had seen him likened to the Gunners' record goalscorer Thierry Henry, who made a similar positional switch during his time in north London, but manager Wenger has only briefly experimented with Walcott as a striker. Thierry Henry was prolific as a striker for Arsenal after being moved inside from his familiar wide role . Arsene Wenger has only briefly used Walcott up front, and Wright says it should have been persisted with . Liverpool's Raheem Sterling is an Arsenal target who also has his contract expiring in the near future . 'I always believed Theo should have been a striker at Arsenal with his pace. I thought playing him on the right would last so long and then he would get moved inside,' Wright told Goal. I'm not saying he's the same kind of player as Thierry Henry by any stretch, but I thought Arsene would move him inside. 'I think that's been to his detriment, because he would have learned a lot more about the game and runs he'd have to make. I've seen him finish very well when he gets into one-on-one situations.'",

The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of \u00a39,000 a year to \u00a36,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto\u00a0overlap with Labour policy,\u00a0including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of \u00a39,000 a year to \u00a36,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP\u2019s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called \u2018modest\u2019 spending increases funded by yet more borrowing \u2013 but which in fact total \u00a3180billion over five years. Scotland\u2019s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a \u2018progressive alliance\u2019 for people \u2018right across the UK\u2019. \u2018There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,\u2019 she told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. Today\u2019s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party\u2019s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a \u2018strong team\u2019 of SNP MPs in Westminster would help \u2018rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected\u2019. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year\u2019s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. \u2018We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland\u2019s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn\u2019t leave the UK but lead the UK,\u2019 she said. \u2018So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland\u2019s voice shouldn\u2019t be heard or that Scotland\u2019s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.\u2019 However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today\u2019s launch over her plans for \u2018full fiscal autonomy\u2019 or effective \u2018home rule\u2019, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a \u2018fiscally autonomous\u2019 Scotland would have a \u00a37.6billion black hole in its finances.",

Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg . A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday . A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday . At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA.\u00a0Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow . 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' an RSPCA spokesperson told Fairfax media . There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said . The taskforce was established to investigate the use of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets to train competitive greyhounds. It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

Industry insiders have said that the initiative is part of a wider move to smarten up Tesco stores in the eyes of consumers. Show us your moves: The supermarket giant has encouraged employees to dance in the store in whatever style they see fit. Other healthy tips are to have walking meetings or start running on the spot while at work . One suggested that slimmer employees can work faster and are less likely to be off sick, according to\u00a0the Sun. The insider said: 'Let's be honest, trim workers are less likely to take days off sick, plus they can stack shelves more quickly than fat ones. Stay in shape: Tesco's new boss Dave Lewis. The supermarket has encouraged its staff to get fit . 'But this also ties in with attempts to smarten up Tesco stores. Healthy workers will give a more appealing look than a bunch of sweaty, overweight workers wheezing around the aisles.' Among the ways to get fit and healthy, according to Tesco's post, is to 'encourage your colleagues to have walking meetings \u2013 get outside in the fresh air to help boost your steps and your creativity!' It also states: 'Dancing can be an excellent way of keeping fit \u2013 it\u2019s great fun and anyone can do it. And there are so many different types, there\u2019s bound to be a style out there for you!' The bizarre tips continue for when workers are at home.

The intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester, by builders who were renovating the property. Oblivious to its true value and historical significance, the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers. The four-poster oak wood bed (above), which was dumped in the car park of Redland House Hotel in Chester and later sold at auction for \u00a32,200, has now been confirmed by DNA as once belonging to King Henry VII . The intricately-carved bed was left in the car park of the former hotel by builders who were renovating the property and, oblivious to its true value and historical significance,  left it to be picked up by auctioneers . It was snapped up for \u00a32,200 in 2010 by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland who spotted the item, which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival, on the internet. However, he was shocked when his new 'Victorian' purchase arrived and approached TV historian Jonathan Foyle with a suspicion that the bed was, in fact, the only surviving Tudor bed. Since then, Mr Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII. He said tests confirmed it was European oak and of a sub-species 'typical of the origin of the finest, slow-grown oak imported by the medieval elites', with analysis of the historic paintwork proving its age. 'Under the varnish, traces of late medieval decoration have been found,' he said. He has traced it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire to see the Stanley family, who had helped him to victory in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Mr Foyle said DNA from the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII (pictured) and he traced\u00a0it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire.  Henry VIII may have been conceived in the bed . The bed was snapped up by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland,\u00a0for \u00a32,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former\u00a0Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester (above) TV historian Jonathan Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to King Henry VII . He also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch. The carving also features biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility, such as acorns, bunches of grapes and strawberries. Meanwhile, scribblings in a Victorian furniture restorer's diary suggested that the bed was at Lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644. Mr Foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of Victorian revivalists by reflecting on the Tudors' belief that they had been chosen by God to save England from civil war. The bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch . The bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . He said the headboard showed Henry VII and his bride as Adam and Eve transmuted into Christ - adding: 'It's arguably the cradle of the English Reformation. Henry VIII may have been conceived in bed . The carved four-poster bed, which has been revealed as Henry VIIs, was reportedly created for the marriage of the first Tudor King and his wife, Elizabeth of York, on January 18, 1486. It is highly likely that the couple's son, Henry, was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Born at Greenwich Palace in 1491, Henry VIII was the third child and second son of Henry VII and his wife. Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 April, 1509. Under Henry VIII's reign, England turned in favour of Protestantism and split from Rome, the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded France. Jonathan Foyle, chief executive of World Monuments Fund Britain, said: 'This bed belonged to Henry VIII. It has to be the most important piece of furniture [in England' - and arguably, royal artefact.' He added: 'Even the Westminster coronation chair has less to say than this.' Experts believe Henry VII may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son. 'Look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of Christ and Mary; it's Henry VIII's God complex in a nutshell.' Dr Foyle described the 15th Century artefact, which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in England, as 'a complete national treasure'. He added: 'Evidence suggests the bed was made for the Painted Chamber of Westminster Palace for the marriage ceremony at Westminster Abbey on January 18, 1486.' Mr Foyle is backed by other experts, such as Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, who described the rediscovery as 'exceptionally important'. The medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to \u00a320million, although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display. It is part of the 'A Bed of Roses' exhibition at the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, at Hever Castle in Kent which also features a portrait of Henry VIII as a young man. The bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in England. In 2013, the battle-scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in Leicester. Meanwhile, in December of the same year, archaeologists uncovered a site in the Amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of Atahualpa, the last emporer of the Incas. And last year, explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to Alfred the Great in the grounds of Hyde Abbey in Winchester. Henry VII's four-poster bed will remain on display in the Long Gallery at Hever Castle in Kent until November 22.",

But one thing is for certain: it definitely took guts. With a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion, it can be revealed that Prince Andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in Calcutta. Rescued from brothels and domestic servitude, child labour and human trafficking, the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called Key to Freedom. Moved: Prince Andrew during his visit to an Indian refuge in 2012, which inspired him to form the charity . Their kimonos, duster coats, pyjamas, scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the British High Street by Topshop, with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary. What makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after Andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with American \u2018sex slave\u2019 Virginia Roberts, who had been working for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire. The claims, furiously denied by the Duke, have now been struck out of American court records, effectively clearing his name. He was inspired to launch Key to Freedom after visiting a girls\u2019 refuge on an official trip to India. He came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation and swiftly donated \u00a310,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, the Duke said: \u2018I was incredibly impressed with the work of the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation during my Diamond Jubilee visit to India in May 2012. \u2018I could see that it would be possible to complement [founder and chairman] Aloka Mitra\u2019s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products. It is incredible to see what the team has achieved. Roberts had been working for Andrew's former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire (pictured together above) \u2018I am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the United Kingdom. \u2018Most importantly, this has helped the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation support more young people to develop skills, which is an important area of focus for my work.\u2019 One of the young women who moved him so deeply was Anita, now 19. She was chosen to show the Duke how to block-print silk when he visited the refuge. In return, he left two copies of Little Red\u2019s Summer Adventure, a book written by his former wife Sarah. The child of two tea garden labourers from northern Bengal, Anita was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends. Lured to New Delhi with the promise of a job to help her support her family, she escaped only to find herself living as a \u2018railway child\u2019 at the city\u2019s station. Illiterate and destitute, she had no way home until she was taken in by the WIF where she met the Duke on his trip. She was among the first girls to sign up to Key to Freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees \u2013 approximately \u00a3430 \u2013 supplying silk goods to Topshop. She has also been reunited with her family near Darjeeling. \u2018We traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted,\u2019 revealed Aloka. \u2018Once we had told them her real story and that she\u2019d learned English and Bengali and maths, and that she had a craft and was earning a living, they changed their mind.\u2019 Anita said: \u2018I am doing well now and so is my mother. She was sick and I have been able to pay for medical treatment for her. \u2018I have earned almost 40,000 rupees through Key to Freedom and I have a skill which will help my future. I hope I keep getting orders for my work. I hope it won\u2019t stop.\u2019 Prince Andrew\u2019s 25-year-old daughter, Princess Eugenie, and his former wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have both paid private visits to help support the charity, and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative. The Duke\u2019s eldest daughter Beatrice, 26, was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months, although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in New York. Eugenie also works in the city for an online auction house. Other workers with Key to Freedom include Taralika, 25, who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home. \u2018She was locked up in a brothel and beaten, and then starved for days for refusing to have sex,\u2019 said Aloka. Profits: About \u00a320,000 from Topshop sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their UK stores . \u2018Finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police. She was, and still remains, mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she\u2019s making excellent progress. She is happy and confident working as a tailor.\u2019 Another Key to Freedom success story is Shila, 21, an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of Calcutta. Aloka said: \u2018She now has a bank account like any other working woman. It has totally changed her life. \u2018Poverty makes these women victims. They suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn. They live with abuse \u2013 mental, physical and sexual \u2013 just to be certain of food and shelter. \u2018The Duke understood that and wanted to make a difference \u2013 as the father of two daughters I think the plight of the girls here resonated with him. \u2018He wanted to given them their independence. Handmade: A silk Topshop kimono . \u2018There was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit. The only thing he asked me was, \u201cWhat do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls?\u201d \u2018I spoke to him about alternative income earning, a regular outlet to sell their work, and skills development to make their craft more marketable. His aides called less than an hour after he\u2019d left and set up a meeting the same night. \u2018He had already spoken to the Duchess of York about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could. The name Key to Freedom was her idea.\u2019 Aloka added: \u2018While I understood that their heart was in the right place, I also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought. \u2018Not only did they find the time, they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today. \u2018It was Prince Andrew\u2019s skills at connecting businesses that linked us to Topshop. It\u2019s nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the UK.\u2019 Aloka came to London for talks with the Duke\u2019s team at Buckingham Palace just three months after their initial meeting, and by summer 2013 Key to Freedom was up and running. It fulfilled its first order to Topshop, every piece individually signed by the woman who made it, in July 2013. Since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold. Yesterday, the High Street giant, which sent designer Penny McIvor to India to assist with colours, patterns and quality control, confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year. Topshop declined to discuss sales figures, but it is understood around \u00a320,000 has so far been paid by the company, which makes no profit from the scheme, to the Prince Andrew Charitable Foundation. This then sends the money back to Key to Freedom in Calcutta. In addition, the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of Prince Andrew\u2019s Pitch@Palace events for entrepreneurs last month, where 200 of its scarves were also on sale. The scheme is another of his business-to-business initiatives uniting start-ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors, venture capitalists and mentors. A Buckingham Palace source said that the Prince remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity \u2013 such as Pitch@Palace \u2013 to promote it. \u2018It\u2019s been completely empowering for the girls here,\u2019 said Aloka. \u2018It\u2019s about honour and dignity, and having control over their own future. \u2018It means they can look ahead and put their past behind them.\u2019",

But the grey car he is accused of using to transport the bodies has been lost, Bristol Crown Court was told. Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra (similar to the one shown here) at the centre of a double murder case . Timothy Crook (pictured) is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles in a grey Nissan Micra . Sarah Jones, representing Crook, 50, said the blunder could have forensic consequences for his case. Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model. 'It was a particular model which we believe did not allow for the laying down of the back seats.' Crook is accused of killing his parents (pictured) at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live . Police said the car (similar to the one pictured) which Crook is said to have driven was not lost and was in the North of England . A spokeswoman for the CPS added: 'It's not us who lost the car. We don't investigate the case, we can't be in possession of the car.' Wiltshire Police said the car was not lost, but did not know where it was exactly. A spokesman said: 'The vehicle has not been lost, we understand it to be in the North of England. 'But I believe there was a conversation in court around whether or not it would need to be brought back for further forensics etc.' Crook appeared at the plea and case management hearing via video link from Rampton Hospital and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to the two murder charges. He is accused of murdering both parents between July 6 and 12, 2007. Some 49 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial which is provisionally set to open on July 6 and last up to four weeks.

The Homeless Period project hopes to shred the taboo around females living on the streets and their monthly cycle, and is encouraging people to donate tampons and towels to their local homeless shelter. A campaign video  tells the story of a woman called Patricia, who slept rough on the streets of Brixton for six months and was forced to use\u00a0makeshift sanitary products while menstruating. Scroll down for video . The Homeless Period campaign shines a spotlight on the plight of women living on the streets who don't have access to proper sanitary care during their periods . The team behind the campaign, Oliver Frost, Josie Shedden and Sara Bakhaty, wrote hard-hitting messages on cardboard boxes and photographed them on the streets of London . Using marker pens on cardboard boxes, the video writes the words of Patricia as she speaks them; focusing on how depressing she found it to not be able to access hygienic menstruation products. Patricia, who used to sleep on the 137 bus in Brixton Hill, says that when her period came, she would use 'ripped up cloth' as a  sanitary towel.\u00a0She has since been housed in a flat by South London homeless charity Spires. Among the cardboard placards held up are the words: 'Why does a woman have to rip up a cloth put between her to protect herself from bleeding?' Another is written with the words: 'I used to feel very depressed. It used to get me down.' The project was started by Oliver Frost, Josie Shedden and Sara Bakhaty, who met while working as interns at an advertising agency. The trio told FEMAIL that they began the campaign as a way of drawing attention to the amount of women who live on the streets after realising that society considered homelessness to be a 'male' issue. The campaign has prompted supporters to start their own collection boxes for tampons and sanitary towels: this (pictured above) was one of seven boxes collected in the workplace of Twitter user Sarah Wyatt . While homeless shelters receive funding for condoms, there is currently no government funding to supply charities with aid for sanitary products . They said that they were surprised to find that approximately 26 per cent of people who access homelessness services are women. Oliver Frost adds that periods seem to be a forgotten issue when it comes to living on the streets. 'It's that for many people, it's never even crossed their minds. As we say on the campaign site \"It doesn't bear thinking about\u2026 and that's the problem\".' While there is public funding for condoms to be supplied to homeless shelters, there is no financial aid for tampons and sanitary towels. Nearly 81,000 people have signed a petition to lobby the government for better funding to buy sanitary care. Frost says he hopes that the petition will 'promise a more long term solution to the issue, and the amount of funding it would need is relatively small.' The group aims to present the petition to the Secretary of Health or if they reach their 150,000 signature target before a new government is elected, then to lobby Simon Stevens,\u00a0Chief Executive of the NHS. A campaign video includes the voice of Patricia, who lived for six months on the streets of Brixton. She says she was forced to used ripped up cloth as a makeshift sanitary towel . Frost said donations are key to the campaign's success: 'For us, the hope is that #TheHomelessPeriod will become a platform for people wanting to help with donations. 'We've had people from around the country contact us with their own local initiatives and fundraisers for the campaign. Our side is in promoting those efforts and connecting them with other people who want to help.' Supporters have been dropping boxes of tampons and towels into their local homeless shelters, with one donor, Sarah Wyatt, so inspired that she has set up a crowd-funding page to encourage more people to donate. On her gofundme page, Wyatt says: 'I recently read an article about the lives of homeless women and the difficulties they face when they have their period. 'I had never really thought about it that way before, these women have little or no access to sanitary products. I decided to do something and did a collection in my workplace which got an amazing response.'",

With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on\u00a0YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own \u2013 but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what\u2019s best for the other person. If you\u2019re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can\u2019t do that, you\u2019re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden \u2013 suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner\u2019s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won\u2019t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don\u2019t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you\u2019re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don\u2019t do that.'",

The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston as Derek Lyle, Gavin Reilly and a Lee Wallace own goal gave Queen of the South\u2019s play-off hopes a massive boost. But McCall is adamant that confidence will not be dented by the scale of the loss and he expects his players to bounce back in Sunday\u2019s home meeting with Raith Rovers. Stuart McCall  urged Rangers to show an immediate response to the first defeat of his tenure . The Ibrox side crashed to a second Championship defeat of the season at Palmerston . \u2018We\u2019ve already spoken about going into the play-offs with good momentum,\u2019 said McCall. \u2018Tonight is a set-back but we\u2019ve got to make sure on Sunday that we don\u2019t have another set-back or then it can become a problem. \u2018We will be fully focused on Sunday and we will be looking for the three points. \u2018There will be no confidence factor come Sunday \u2014 I can assure you of that. Sometimes you get beat and you just have to hold your hands up and give credit to the opposition. \u2018I was pleased with certain things leading up to their first goal. I thought we were doing well. \u2018I said to the lads that we will put a line under it. Yeah, we know we weren\u2019t good tonight but we will be good on Sunday.\u2019 Rangers remain third in the table \u2014 behind Hibernian on goal difference but with a game in hand \u2014 after what was their biggest-ever loss to Queens. \u2018Fair play to them,\u2019 said McCall, who expects Cammy Bell to be fit to face Raith after a minor knee injury. \u2018They were clinical when they had their chances. New manager McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after doubling Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . \u2018We controlled large parts of the first half but they got a lot of good blocks in. It\u2019s about scoring goals and they got the first one. \u2018Then we lost a goal that was really poor defending straight from the kick-off. Then you are chasing the game and that suited them with their pace on the counter attack. \u2018We had some chances in the second half but we never really did enough. We weren\u2019t good enough to win the game but we move on. \u2018I\u2019ve said it before and I will say it again, there will be ups and downs between now and the end of the season. It\u2019s how we react to it, and Sunday can\u2019 t come quickly enough for me.\u2019 Jubilant Queen of the South boss James Fowler was thrilled with a result that saw his team leapfrog Falkirk into that crucial fourth place in the Championship standings. \u2018We were backs to the wall a wee bit in the first half,\u2019 admitted Fowler. \u2018But we managed to cope with that. We got the goal and then getting another one so early in the second half was great. \u2018All the players were great and we are pushing hard.\u2019",

The 6am flight took just an hour and a half to get to the unscheduled stop at Colorado Springs - but then languished for another six hours, before everybody was ordered off anyway. According to local news station KOAA, those aboard Flight 4934, which was being operated by Republic Airlines, were finally taken to their destination by bus. In accordance with federal law the airline gave people the chance to get off the plane after it had been stuck for three hours. But passengers were told that if they got off, that would be the end of their trip and they would have to give up on connecting flights and make their own way from Colorado Springs. Trapped: Pictured is Kathie Ridings, one of the passengers who was stuck at Colorado Springs . According to those on board, virtually everyone chose to stay on the plane. In the mean time, passengers told how the short-haul flight's meager supplies of crackers and water dwindled, while the single bathroom became 'foul' and ran out of necessary supplies. A Republic spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Passengers were offered the opportunity to deplane, despite several erroneous media reports. 'Republic eventually cancelled the flight, and the Company repositioned another aircraft so passengers could continue on to their destination. 'Further, United was reaching out to customers to offer compensation.

United will be looking to end a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats on Sunday when City make the short trip across town. Van Gaal lost his first encounter with United's closest rivals last November, when Sergio Aguero struck the only goal in a 1-0 win for the Blues. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing Man City . Van Gaal, pictured with Juan Mata on Friday, believes Man City will not be as defensive-minded as Aston Villa . Manchester United are currently one point ahead of local rivals Manchester City . But Van Gaal is confident of victory this weekend, stating that he thinks City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favour. Van Gaal believes teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat. Van Gaal is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about Sunday's opposition than he did last week when relegation-threatened Villa came to Old Trafford. 'I had more fear of Aston Villa than Manchester City,' the United manager said, before adding: 'Aston Villa was more defensive. 'I don't expect Manchester City shall play so defensive as Aston Villa. Then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence. 'A long ball is very difficult to defend. But (against) Manchester City, I don't expect very much long balls. 'It's another game and that's why I have less fear against Manchester City in spite of losing 1-0 against them in the last game.' Ander Herrera scored two goals as Manchester United picked up all three points against Aston Villa . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the match during this season's previous Manchester derby . That is not to say he would not cherish his first win over City. 'I dream of it, every player shall dream of the victory,' the United boss said. During his nine months in charge, assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club chef Mike Donnelly have taught the Dutchman about United's rivalries. But if he needed a reminder of the enmity between City and United, he got it this week from his wife Truus, whose hairdresser is a blue. 'I'm not so often in the city, but when I am there, the people are talking about the derby and even when I come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'My wife's hairdresser is a Manchester City fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women. 'I like it. You play football for the fans and I hope we can give our fans the victory.' Bragging rights are not the only thing at stake. Victory would strengthen United's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their 'noisy neighbours'. A third-placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the Champions League and that is what Van Gaal is aiming for. 'When you win, third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that, besides me, of course,' Van Gaal said. 'Third is good because you are certainly qualified for the Champions League and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season.' Chris Smalling was sent off during his side's defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in November . Smalling is heckled by Manchester City supporters as he makes his way off the field . The fact that United and City are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been. But Van Gaal has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year, after making a few additions to his squad. 'I want to improve my selection for the next season. Then we can make a bigger step,' he said. 'Sir Alex Ferguson has done it before. Jose Mourinho is doing it now. 'Last season he didn't win anything. Now he is winning the title, now I try to do that also.' United's run of five straight league victories has moved them above City, who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions. The fact that City have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the Dutchman though. 'That's not my history,' he said. 'The last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history.' Chris Smalling was the man who was dismissed at the Etihad Stadium. The defender earned his first booking for blocking Joe Hart as he went to kick the ball out of his hands, and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down James Milner. Van Gaal will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend. He said: 'In such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then, so I hope we have learned from that moment. 'We have had five red cards this year. It's a record in my career as a manager and that's not good.'",

Federici allowed Alexis Sanchez's driven shot to slip through his body in extra-time as Arsenal ran out 2-1 winners at Wembley to reach their second consecutive final, having beaten Hull to lift the trophy last year. The mistake overshadowed a number of strong saves Federici had made to keep his side in the game and Szczesny had only kind words for his opposite number. Wojciech Szczesny (left) says he feels sorry for Adam Federici after his mistake in the FA Cup semi-final . 'He can be very proud. It only went to extra-time because the goalkeeper was magnificent,' Szczesny told Arsenal's official website. 'We're very happy to go through but personally I do feel for the goalkeeper. 'It's a difficult moment for him. He was the best player on the pitch and in his dreams last night he was probably hoping he would get them through to the final. 'He did everything to do so but got very unlucky in extra-time. The Australian let an Alexis Sanchez effort slip through his hands and sneak over the line in extra-time . 'It was a really good performance from him and he's shown what a good keeper he is.' Arsenal looked like they might enjoy a comfortable afternoon when Sanchez opened the scoring in the first half, but Garath McCleary's equaliser galvanised the Championship outfit. 'You know what to expect when you play Championship sides,' Szczesny said. Federici was inconsolable at the final whistle despite his team-mates and staff trying to help . 'They're very solid defensively, they're not scared to put their foot or head in and they defend very well. 'Today they did that with a great performance by their goalkeeper. It was a difficult game but we just got over the line.' Arsenal are now just one win away from defending the crown they secured last year, with either Liverpool or Aston Villa lying in wait in the final. Szczesny was also at fault for the Reading goal when he let Gareth McCleary's shot find a way into the net . Victory would also see the Gunners become the most successful FA Cup team of all time as they currently sit level on 11 titles with Manchester United. 'We want to win for the fans,' Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla added. 'It's always special to play at Wembley and we have a good opportunity to get the title. 'Now we have to wait for the other team - Liverpool or Aston Villa.'",

George Kirby and 91-year-old Doreen Luckie from Eastbourne, East Sussex, will marry after first getting together 27 years ago in 1988 . George, currently 102, proposed on Valentine's Day and will marry for the third time on June 13 - getting hitched to Doreen in front of 60 guests . 'I didn't get down on one knee, because I don't think I would have been able to get back up.' Between them they have had seven children, 15 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. They finally decided to make the union official by giving into pressure from their elderly children. George, currently 102, proposed on Valentine's Day and will marry for the third time on June 13 - getting hitched to Doreen in front of 60 guests. Doreen said: 'I won't be much of a blushing bride, but I'm getting a bit giddy thinking about it.' On their wedding day, the pair will have a combined age of 194 years and 281 days - smashing the previous world record of 188 years set by a couple in 2013.

The pair, started courting in the 1988, when they met through an organisation to find friends for mature people. George, then 76, had just got divorced while Doreen, who lived in Staplehurst, Kent, had sadly become a widow three years earlier following 36 years of marriage. She said: 'He used to come to my house. We got on straight away. He liked the roses in my front garden.' George Kirby and his fiance Doreen Luckie pictured in the 1980's when they met through an organisation to find friends for mature people . The couple quickly became an item and set up home together in 1990, but George only proposed to her on this February 14. George said: 'We were having dinner and I asked Doreen if she wanted to be married to me for a short time. I was so happy that she said yes.' The pair will get married at the Langham Hotel, owned by George's son Neil, where they have lived since 2013. Neil, 63, who will be best man, said: 'We've adopted Doreen as our mum and we're delighted that she's going to become a Kirby. 'We're thrilled that they are going to get married in front of all their proud friends and family. 'Also, it's about time my dad has finally made an honest woman out of her.' George was born in London in June 1912 and joined the RAF as a physical education instructor in 1933, where he stayed for 25 years. He was a passionate and talented boxer, winning every single one of the 60 fights he entered during his life. He finally gave up work, and lifting dumbbells, at the age of 94, although continued to tend Doreen's garden in Kent. Doreen was born in Brixton in September 1923 and spent much of her career as a shorthand typist for the Director of Public Prosecutions at Temple, where she worked on transcripts for the cases of the Kray twins and Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. Sprightly Doreen keeps herself in shape by doing yoga classes on the seafront every week. Instead of wedding presents, the pair would like to raise as much money as they can for their chosen charities - the Royal Air Forces Association and the Women's Royal Naval Service .

Lucian Faggiano bought the building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy and had planned to turn it into a trattoria - but renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked. And while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a Messapian tomb built 2,000 years ago, a Roman granary, a Franciscan chapel, and even etchings thought to be made by the Knights Templar. Scroll down for 3D tour . Lucian Faggiano's dream of opening a restaurant was scuppered when a dig to find a blocked sewage point yielded some 2,000 years of hidden history, including vast rooms and pottery (shown in this image that features Mr Faggiano left and his son) In a bid to stop the sewage backing up, Mr Faggiano, 60, and his two sons dug a trench and instead of isolating the offending pipe found underground corridors and rooms beneath the property on 56 Via Ascanio Grandi,The New York Times reported. The search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium. Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and an important trading post for the Romans. But the first layers of the city date to the time of Homer, according to local historian Mario De Marco. Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the building has been turned into Museum Faggiano (pictured) and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers discovered by the family . He imagined it would take a week to dig down and fix the plumbing beneath the building, but instead, the DIY mission led to the discovery of a Messapian tomb, a Roman granary (pictured left), a Franciscan chapel - and even etchings from the Knights Templar. An ancient room beneath the modern building is shown right . The search for the pipe (shown in this image of Mr Faggiano and his son) began at the turn of the millennium when no-one could have predicted the treasures hidden beneath the floorboards, which revealed a subterranean world dating back to before the birth of Jesus . It is not unusual for religious relics to turn up in fields or in the middle of the city itself, which has a mixture of old architecture . For example, a century ago, a Roman amphitheatre was recently found beneath a marble column bearing the statue of Lecce\u2019s patron saint, Orontius in the main square and recently a Roman temple was found under a car park. \u2018Whenever you dig a hole, centuries of history come out,\u2019 said Severo Martini, a member of the City Council. Years of excavations have seen the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Here, Mr Faggiano carries a piece of Roman pottery from an underground room . The building yielded plenty of nooks and crannies including mysterious shafts (pictured left and right) which lead to older parts of the building deeper and deeper underground . Lucian Faggiano bought the seemingly standard building in Lecce, Puglia in the south of Italy, (marked on this map) but his dream of turning it into a trattoria was put on hold thanks to a broken toilet.\u00a0Lecce, at the heel of Italy\u2019s \u2018boot\u2019 was once a crossroads in the Mediterranean and a trading post for the Romans . The origins of Lecce in southern Italy are thought to be more than 2,000 years old. It was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, explaining the city's Greek culture. According to legend, a city called Sybar existed at the time of the Trojan War and was founded by the Messapii. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, who gave it the name Lupiae, which later became Lecce. Under the emperor Hadrian, in the second century AD, the city moved two miles (3km) northeast, got a theatre and an amphitheatre and was connected to the Hadrian Port. Oronotius of Lecce, who is known as Sant'Oronzo is thought to have served as the city's first Christian bishop and is now Lecce's patron saint. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was sacked by king Totila in the Gothic Wars. After that it was conquered once again by the Byzantines in 549 and remained part of the Eastern Empire despite some small conquests. After the Normans arrived in the 11th century, Lecce grew in commercial importance again, having been an important trading post in Roman times. It grew rich and became one of the most important cities in southern Italy, evidenced by its many impressive Baroque monuments. Plague broke out in the 17th century and the city was briefly home to Allied fighters fighting the Nazis in the Second World War. Mr Faggiano asked his sons to help fix the problem with the plumbing so he could accelerate the opening of his restaurant, in a building that looked like it was modernised. But when they dug down they hit a floor of medieval stone, beneath which was a Messapian tomb, built by people who lived in the area before the birth of Jesus. Legend has it the city was founded by the Messapii, who are said to have been Cretans in Greek records, but then the settlement was called Sybar. Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain, and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife, in part perhaps because he was lowering his youngest son, Davide, 12 though small gaps in the floor to aid his work. But his wife, Anna Maria San\u00f2 suspected the work was more complex than it appeared thanks to the amount of dirty clothes she was washing, and because of dirt and debris being taken away. Investigators shut down the site, warning Mr Faggiano he was conducting an unofficial archaeological dig. After a year, work continued but had to be overseen by heritage officials who witnessed the emergence of Roman devotional bottles, ancient vases and a ring with Christian symbols as well as hidden frescoes and medieval pieces. Retired cultural heritage official, Giovanni Giangreco, who was involved with the excavation, said: \u2018The Faggiano house has layers that are representative of almost all of the city\u2019s history, from the Messapians to the Romans, from the medieval to the Byzantine time.\u2019 Afraid of costs and the delay in opening the restaurant, Mr Faggiano initially kept his amateur archaeology a secret from his wife. Here, he sorts though pieces of glass and pottery found in one of the rooms. There are even pieces embedded in the wall . Upon further investigation, the family team also discovered a Roman room that was used to store grain and a basement of a Franciscan convent where nuns were thought to have once prepared the bodies of the dead. The cavernous property has been turned into a museum so visitors can easily see the remains (pictured) Mr Faggiano (pictured here with his son in an ancient underground room) admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant . Despite bearing the financial load of the dig, the family became fascinated about the history beneath their building and made ends meet by renting rooms in it. Mr Faggiano admits to becoming obsessed with the project, but still wanted to open his restaurant. He said: \u2018At one point, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore I bought cinder blocks and was going to cover it up and pretend it had never happened.\u2019 Eight years after it was meant to open as a restaurant, the incredible building has been turned into Museum Faggiano and a number of staircases allow visitors to travel down through time to visit the ancient underground chambers. However, Mr Faggiano hasn\u2019t given up on his culinary dream and is planning on opening a restaurant at a less complex location \u2013 even though he finally found the troublesome sewage pipe.

Wisconsin moved through to the final with a tense victory over Kentucky at the Lucas Oil Stadium . And Kentucky has a long ride home, finishing the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome.

Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled. He made only one free throw, and from there, Wisconsin clinched it from the foul-line. Earlier Saturday, Justise Winslow scored 19 points and Jahlil Okafor added 18 to lead top-seeded Duke to an 81-61 victory over Michigan State on Saturday and a shot at its fifth national championship.

Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead.

Doerr's novel had received rave reviews upon its release last spring. \"I must blame Anthony Doerr for lost sleep, because once I started reading his new novel, 'All the Light We Cannot See,' there was no putting it down,\" wrote William T. Vollmann in The New York Times Book Review. Doerr's work was also a finalist for the National Book Award. It's his second novel and fourth work of fiction, including two short story collections. 2015 Pulitzer Prize winners in journalism named . \"Between Riverside and Crazy,\" a play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, won the Pulitzer for drama. An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf***** with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off -- except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think. She has a good grip on her subject and uses a light touch when it is most needed.\" Other winners in arts and letters categories include \"Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People\" by Elizabeth A. Fenn (history); \"The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe\" by David I. Kertzer (biography/autobiography); \"Anthracite Fields\" by Julia Wolfe (music); and \"Digest\" by Gregory Pardlo (poetry). The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University and are considered some of the most prestigious honors in journalism and literature.",

The result brought Lazio's run of six consecutive victories to an end and the Biancocelesti could be dragged back into third place should their city rivals Roma beat Atalanta in the capital on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, ambitious Sampdoria were held to an unlikely goalless draw by Cesena but used the point to take a share of fourth place. The Genoa club dominated their relegation-threatened opponents from start to finish but found goalkeeper Federico Agliardi an immovable object when their radar was not malfunctioning.

A dog walker used nail clippers to free a kidnapped woman who police say was held prisoner and sexually assaulted by a Canadian man for five days. The 27-year-old sex trade worker emerged from a home in Toronto, Canada, bound by handcuffs, badly bruised and naked from the waist down begging for help. Peter Hamilton heard her cries as he was passing by and desperately tried to free her from her restraints. She told him that her kidnapper was still inside, but had fallen asleep. Mr Hamilton wanted to call the police, but had left his cell phone at home, forcing him to take out the only item he had on him - the nail clippers. Police claim Rejean Hermel Perron held the alleged victim at gunpoint on March 31 when she refused to go inside. He is then said to have held the woman for five days,\u00a0subjecting her to sexual assaults including 'ritualistic actions' that officers said they were 'unfamiliar with'. Detectives believe there could be more victims who have yet to come forward. The 43-year-old is alleged to have met the woman, in the Sherbourne and Shuter Street area of the city before the pair returned to his home. The National Post\u00a0reports that she became 'uncomfortable' and made it clear she wanted to leave. But he then allegedly produced the weapon and restrained her with duct tape and handcuffs. Police say she was subjected to multiple sexual assaults. Perron was arrested on Monday and later charged with sexual assault with a weapon, kidnapping, forcible confinement and assault. Describing the dramatic escape, Mr Hamilton told the CBC\u00a0how he was walking his dog in the Dundas Street East and Jones Street area when he heard desperate pleas for help. Hero: Dog walker Peter Hamilton heard the woman's cries for help before he saw her come out of the house bound by restraints and naked from the waist down . Quick thinking: He wanted to call the police but left his cell phone at home, so had to use the only implement he had on him to free the woman - his nail clippers . He said a woman appeared on a veranda of a home but could not move further because of the restraints on her hands and feet. She warned him her kidnapper was still armed and inside the home. Mr Hamilton told CBC: 'My first thought was 'how do I get her out of here?' 'I knew this was a dangerous situation. I couldn't leave her, but I could not go back to my house to get my phone.' When a man emerged from the home, Mr Hamilton stood up ready for a confrontation. But the man then turned and fled, it is reported. Mr Hamilton added:\u00a0'This is where it could have taken a turn for the worse,' said Hamilton. 'He came out and he ran. He saw us and he just ran and that was a very good thing.' 'She was very emotionally distressed and she said, \"I'm sorry I have to put you through this.\" There was nothing to apologize for. 'It's just the right thing to do. We live in a society where sometimes people turn a blind eye to what's going on around them.' In part, he has thankful for having his dog, as he wouldn't have been walking through the neighborhood for any reason. He told the Toronto Star: Without having that dog, I wouldn't have taken a walk through the neighbourhood, and if he hadn't taken a walk, he wouldn't have encountered a shocking crime in progress, and wouldn't have had the opportunity to intervene and possibly save a woman's life. 'Whatever fate or destiny comes into it, the dog has as much of a part. 'The horror of what happened to her, of what she had gone through, hadn't really sunk into me yet. 'What sinks into you is the horror you're seeing right now, which is that there's a naked woman on the floor in handcuffs who needs help.' After he contacted police, Mr Hamilton said he spent the day with his wife and went for a hike out of town. 'That was good. It calmed everybody down,' he said. The woman was rushed to hospital after passers-by called emergency services and is said to be recovering. Crime scene: After Mr Hamilton helped free the woman, a man emerged from the house, so they ran. The alleged victim is now being treated in hospital .",

Since Audrey is unable to produce enough red blood cells, her parents told the\u00a0Mirror,\u00a0she has faced a host of health issues in her short life. But the condition doesn't stop Audrey from dancing, which she does incredibly well to Bruno Mars\u2019 chart-topping hit Uptown Funk in a widely-watched video that her family posted on her\u00a0Facebook page.

Audrey learned the cute choreographed routine to the Kidz Bop version of the song at her Zumba class in Louisville, Kentucky. Dad Scott Nethery and mom Julie Haise were quick to upload a clip of the six-year-old dancing to Facebook, and the internet was just as quick to watch it. The recording of her complete performance has already reached 2.8 million views since it was posted in March.

Because of her condition, Audrey has already endured 20 blood\u00a0transfusions, and will likely undergo more in the future. Half of people with DBA need a transfusion once every three to five weeks. She was also born with a hole in her heart and a cleft palate, and she isn't growing as fast as her peers, partly because of the steroids she needs to take for her illness. But despite her hurdles, her father Scott told Daily Mail Online, she has plenty of energy and a positive outlook: 'Audrey is a happy, loving, smart, little girl who loves to dance, listen to music, and collect dolls and stuffed animals. She is incredibly strong and leaves an impression on everyone she meets!'

The musically-inclined six-year-old, whose favorite musicians include Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, and the Beatles, has also left an impression on strangers on the internet. Posting cute videos and smiling photos of Audrey have helped the Nethery family to raise thousands of dollars, as well as promote blood drives which they host to give back to the community. 'Once people realize she has a life-threatening illness, it really touches their hearts,' her father told the Mirror.",

The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, \"After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. \"The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system,\" the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. \"Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft,\" it said. \"Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.\" Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. \"The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station,\" a statement said. \"Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight.\" That next flight, which will be the seventh SpaceX commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had \"confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it.\" According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U.S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, \"all of which are replaceable,\" NASA said. U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, from Maryland, is the current space station commander. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Presto and Amanda Barnett contributed to this report.",

After twice being written off in the past, initially following his life-threatening accident in 2009 and again when he left Ferrari at the end of 2013, Massa appears to be a driver at the top of his game. Felipe Massa is preparing for the Bahrain Grand Prix this weekend as he looks ahead to practice .

'The only thing you cannot say (on this occasion) is we are fighting for the championship. 'We had maybe the top car in 2008, and now we are the third team in the championship.

'It's fantastic because the driver cannot do anything alone. You need the whole group working for the best of the driver, and that's really counting a lot for me. 'Maybe also, when many of you wrote after my accident that it changed completely my driving, maybe that's not correct.' Suggested to Massa he had been too easily written off, he said: 'It's much easier to write than drive.'

And incredulous that it took so long. Hinton, 58, looked up, took in the sunshine and thanked God and his lawyers Friday morning outside the county jail in Birmingham, minutes after taking his first steps as a free man since 1985. He spoke of unjustly losing three decades of his life, under fear of execution, for something he didn't do. \"All they had to do was to test the gun, but when you think you're high and mighty and you're above the law, you don't have to answer to nobody,\" Hinton told reporters. \"But I've got news for you -- everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God.\" Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro had ordered Hinton released after granting the state's motion to dismiss charges against him. Hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two Birmingham-area, fast-food restaurant managers, John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason. But a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver Hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case, and the two killings couldn't be linked to each other. \"Death Row Stories\": Hard questions about the U.S. capital punishment system . The state then declined to re-prosecute the case. Hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence, said the Equal Justice Initiative, a group that helped win his release. \"Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice,\" Bryan Stevenson, the group's executive director and Hinton's lead attorney, said of his African-American client. \"I can't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton.\" Stevenson said the \"refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling.\" Amnesty report: Executions down but death sentences on the rise . Dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt, Hinton praised God for his release, saying he was sent \"not just a lawyer, but the best lawyers.\" He said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims. Both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice, he said. \"For all of us that say that we believe in justice, this is the case to start showing, because I shouldn't have (sat) on death row for 30 years,\" he said. Woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . Hinton was accompanied Friday by two of his sisters, one of whom still lives in the Birmingham area. Other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon, Stevenson said. His mother, with whom he lived at the time of his arrest, is no longer living, according to the lawyer. Hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend. He will meet with his attorneys Monday to start planning for his immediate needs, such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup, Stevenson said. The plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and \"sort out what he wants to do,\" Stevenson said.",

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

Caught: Mr Turnbull, 69, was found in a 'compromised position' with Ms Khanim by a governor at the school . The school was said to be packed with pupils and parents when Mr Turnbull and 39-year-old Ms Khanim - who describes herself as a model - were walked in on. The teacher has worked at the school for nine years, hiring out a room to offer private tuition to pupils looking to pass the 11+, The Mirror reported. Mr Turnbull has not commented on the tryst, but the school confirmed senior staff had told him to 'never return'. A school spokeswoman said:\u00a0'Once Mr Turnbull's behaviour was discovered by the school's facilities manager, he promptly informed the assistant headteacher. 'Mr Turnbull was challenged; he fully admitted improper behaviour and was then instructed by the assistant headteacher to leave the school site immediately and to not return.' She added that the teacher was not directly employed by the school but he did hire out the classroom for tuition. 'As far as the school is concerned, while behaviour of the sort alleged is wholly unacceptable in any circumstances, we understand from the advice taken from social services that Mr Turnbull had not engaged in any illegal activity.

Elite: The independent Catholic school charges up to \u00a313,000 a year in fees for students to attend . 'There was no pupil involved, the incident was between Mr Turnbull and an adult female,' she added. School regulator Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and the Department for Education were all informed of the incident. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Independent schools must adhere to the Independent School Standards. Any suggestion that schools are not doing so will be investigated.' Sources close to the school, however, said Mr Turnbull had been allowed to 'leave by the back door' and were angered that he would be able to continue teaching. Ms Khanim declined to comment but told the Birmingham Mail: 'That's not how it all happened.' The Priory School is attended by around 400 pupils, from 'Nursery and Poppets' classes up until sixth form. It charges fees of up to \u00a312,870 a year for its most senior students. On the school's website, its headmaster Jonathan Cramb says 'knowing what is right and wrong' allows teachers to get on with providing an education for pupils. More than 80 per cent of students got five GCSEs graded A* to C last year, well above the national average.",

The results far surpassed most analysts' expectations for the first three months of the year, when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit - and up 40% from a year ago . Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US.

More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29% to $5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion . 'We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. 'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion \u2014 continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow. Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 14, 2014. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again \u2014 not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to \"rebrand\" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a \"relentlessly, insultingly vapid\" effort of \"demographic box-checking.\" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a \"State Farm commercial gone viral\" and also \"boring as s---.\" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed \"I\" to empathetic \"we.\" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.  In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the \"everyday Americans\" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.  In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a \"T\" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?  Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.  Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming \"Morning in America\"? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.  She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging \"schizophrenia,\" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.",

And now that status update about jetting off on holiday is set to be even easier after Virgin Atlantic announced it would allow each passenger one Facebook login for free so they can post an update from 35,000ft. The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",

Randy Linn, now in a California federal prison where he's two years into his 20-year sentence, said that he can't believe that he tried to destroy a place of worship. Federal prosecutors said Linn drove about two hours from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to suburban Toledo on September 30, 2012, and broke into the mosque where he poured gasoline on a prayer rug and lit it on fire. Randy Linn was sentenced two years ago for starting a fire that caused over $1million in damages to a suburban Toledo, Ohio, mosque . Federal prosecutors said Linn drove from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo (pictured) in September 20112, broke into the mosque, poured gasoline on a prayer rug and set it on fire . 'Well again, I\u2019m very sorry for what I did. Hopefully someday you all can forgive me. And yes I don\u2019t like it here, you can tell everyone, that I\u2019m sure will put a smile on everyone face,' he said in his letter, according to The Blade. Cherrefe Kadri, president of the center, said she thought Linn's letter was sincere . Linn had several firearms in his car and carried a gun into the mosque, which was empty at the time. Linn later said while pleading guilty to hate crime charges that he'd become enraged after seeing images of wounded soldiers in the news and decided to burn the mosque. He also blamed what happened on a day of heavy drinking. Being forgiven, he wrote last December, would 'probably give me a little bit of peace of mind.' Cherrefe Kadri, president of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo, told The Blade said she waited nearly six weeks to respond to Linn's letter. Most of the members have moved on, she said. 'I think his letter was truly sincere, and I told him that,' she said. Her response, written on stationery with an image of the mosque at the top, said that she hopes he can make peace with God. 'Neither our community nor I harbor any hatred, ill-will or malice toward you,' she wrote.

It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack. The operation has been ongoing,\" the military source said Monday. It is customary for Kenyan military sources not to give their names to media. Two of the airstrikes hit Al-Shabaab training camps, according to a resident of the southwest Somalian town of Bardera, almost 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Kenyan border, and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. The Kenyan military began its bombing raids Sunday afternoon, targeting the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Godon Dhawe, Somali resident Ibrahim Mohammed said. Godon Dhawe is between Bardera and the Somalia-Kenya border. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the university attack. Also Monday, a police source said Kenyan authorities had intelligence beforehand that a university in Garissa could be attacked, yet the country's rapid response team was stuck in Nairobi for hours after the massacre began, arranging for transport. It's not clear exactly why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital, roughly 370 kilometers (230 miles) west of the attack, but the police source in Garissa told CNN that Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did. Journalists on the ground corroborated that report. Once the team entered the university complex, the situation was quickly defused, journalists and the police source said. Manoah Esipisu, a spokesman for Kenya's president and deputy president, defended the response time, telling CNN there is always criticism regarding whether \"you reacted as fast as you have or shouldn't have.\" \"With the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better,\" he said, adding that Kenyan authorities saved a lot of students and \"got the job done.\" Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed those remarks in a Monday interview with CNN, saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation. \"We have a military garrison in Garissa, and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists. So the response was adequate,\" she said. She repeated Esipisu's assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight. \"Obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning, it's always easy to fall back on things like that, but I can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported,\" Mohamed said. \"Obviously hindsight is always 20/20. We did everything that we could do.\" The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud is the mastermind of Thursday's terrorist attack on Garissa University College. The country's Interior Ministry singled out Mohamud, a senior leader of Al-Shabaab, on Twitter. He is also known by the aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, it said. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a Kenyan ministry document given to CNN. The ministry posted a \"most wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His position as one of Al-Shabaab's top field commanders in southern Somalia has brought him into direct conflict with Kenyan troops deployed as part of African Union forces in the country. \"This is a man who has a lot of grudges against the Kenyans,\" said Stig Jarle Hansen, an associate professor at Oslo's Norwegian University of Life Sciences and author of \"Al-Shabaab in Somalia: The History and Ideology of a Militant Islamist Group.\" Mohamud's network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's in Kenya's North Eastern Province near Somalia. Garissa, the town where the university attack took place, is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from the Somali border. It's within \"striking distance\" of Mohamud's stronghold in Somalia's Middle Juba province, Hansen told CNN. But he noted that Mohamud is better known \"for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks.\" Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter . Over the weekend, Al-Shabaab promised to bring about \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. Though the terrorist group is based in Somalia, it hasn't confined its violence to the lawless nation. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's attack on a quarry in a Kenyan village near the Somali border, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. He's from a clan, the Ogaden, that has a heavy presence in Kenya and Somalia, Hansen said. \"The borders historically have been meaningless to them,\" he said. CNN exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . On Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\" Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact since his son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a church as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Three days of national mourning for victims of the attack, declared by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, began Sunday. CNN's Christian Purefoy and Lilian Leposo reported from Garissa; Eliott C. McLaughlin and Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta; and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mick Krever, David McKenzie, Dominique van Heerden, Nick Migwi, Ashley Fantz, Florence Obondo, Jessica King and journalist Omar Nor contributed to this report.",

An Army spokeswoman said they will go into effect in the 'very near future.' The changes came as a result of feedback from soldiers. But it wasn't so long ago that the Army made a much different announcement concerning its tattoo policy. Highly unpopular regulations that went into effect in March 2014 banned tattoos below the knee or elbow. Soldiers who already had the ink were grandfathered in. Under those regulations, any soldier with tattoos was barred from seeking a\u00a0promotion to warrant officer or commissioning as an officer. Tattoos have long been a part of military culture, but as they have become more popular, and more prominently displayed on the body, the various branches have been regulating them in to try to maintain a professional look.

Artist Dave Poulin has \"had plenty of opportunity to step forward, and our last conversation he wanted $8,000 to $10,000,\" Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost said. \"And then he stated that if we didn't have the funds and we didn't like the statue, we should take it down and put it in storage.\" After the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend, Poulin publicly apologized Monday for his \"most unsettling sculpture\" in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter. \"I take full responsibility for 'Scary Lucy,' though by no means was that my intent or did I wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic Lucy image,\" Poulin wrote in the letter (PDF). \"From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy's beauty or my ability as a sculptor.\" Poulin said he has been talking to Celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture. It seems that cost has been the chief barrier. \"It puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community, they accept it, and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense.\" Poulin wrote in the letter. But the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind. \"I am willing to put my time and money into redoing the Lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years I can do a much better job,\" Poulin wrote. No thanks, Schrecengost said. He said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue. \"It would be reworked from the shoulders up -- the entire head, neck and shoulders, not just the face,\" Schrecengost said in a news release Tuesday. The town has set up a post office box for donations, which can also be made through Kickstarter. But the controversy may not be over. It seems that nearby Jamestown, New York, also has ties to Lucille Ball's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend. Schrecengost's Tuesday statement referred to an anonymous Facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising Jamestown's Lucille Ball profile at the expense of the Celoron statue. \"The best place for a life size statue of Lucy is right where it is now -- in Lucille Ball Memorial Park in her hometown, in the Village of Celoron, NY,\" he said.

The annual Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing. Riot of colour: The Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year . Superstition: People travel from nearby towns to join the Net Boat Fair. Other Water Temple Fairs are held around Chinese New Year. Fishermen from the area take their boats out for show, hoping for good fortune and blessing . Extravagance: An aerial view of the 2015 China Jiangnan Net Boat Fair which commemorates an ancient hero . Starting on different dates in the western calendar, the fair happens annually according to the Chinese Lunar calendar. This year, it began yesterday and the celebrations are expected to last three to seven days, with festivities sometimes being extended to a month long. One of the highlights of the carnival is the Net Boat Fair which showcases the unique culture of Jiangnan water people. One of the most anticipated performances is the 'tie the perfume to your skin' which sees performers attach metal hooks to their forearms. On the other side of the hook hangs a censer containing incense\u00a0or sometimes even heavy anchors with flowers in them to mask the natural smell of the fishing town. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing . The traditional local folklore carnival pays homage to Liu Chengzhong, a figure who led people in annihilating locusts in the Yuan Dynasty . Tradition: Fishermen and their families dress up in traditional clothes. About 50 different folklore groups and nearly two thousand people will be joining the celebrations. It will be the biggest Net Boat Fair in 60 years . The Fair commemorates General Lui Chengzhong, a hero in the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), who successfully eliminated pests during a massive drought. When the Yuan Dynasty came to an end, General Lui killed himself by jumping in the river as an act of loyalty to the Yuan emperor. The locals built the Lui King temple for him and celebrated his heroic acts. Mr Li, one of the participants, told Jia Xing Ping Dao: 'I am the sixth generation to come to this temple fair. 'My great-grandfather once said the celebrations were even more extravagant than what we have now. 'We want to pray for safety and for the Gods to give us proper weather next year.' Music and beats: Little drums are used to scare away angry spirits. This event was listed as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in China in 2011, along with Chinese abacus, an ancient calculator . Cultural heritage: Fishermen prepare shrine offerings, including food, wine, pork, fruit and snacks. An elaborate ritual will be performed on the boats to give thanks to the Gods and the ancestors . The Net Boat Fair has already been included in the list of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage. One of the most important agenda this year is giving out the 'folklore religion activity' certificate to the Liu King temple. Jiangnan Mayor Liang Bokai sauid: 'This marks the first certificate of its kind. It is a massive step for the preservation, promotion and legacy of this folklore religion in the Liu King temple. 'We will further promote our local customs and culture and combine it with tourism in order to put out a new image.' Jiangnan folklore: 'Stepping on whites boats' is a custom for fishermen. Their boats are known to be very unstable because of the exceptionally long frame. Fishermen remodel the boats with a wooden see-saw in the middle. Two people stands on the edge of both sides and jump to make the boat go forward . Tourism: It is a very popular tourist attraction as well. Vendors and shopkeepers appeal their products to passers-by, participants gather for pictures and others pray for blessings .",

A\u00a014-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day . Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday . Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.' Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain  are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead . Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday . London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

The study uncovered a link between belief in God and other societal characteristics, such as a strong social hierarchy. Scientists suggest that religious beliefs help people cope in inhospitable habitats. A study suggests that societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in all-powerful, deities. Here, people carry bags of popcorn through a Christian cemetery, to sell in a shanty town in Lima, Peru . \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland and a founding director of the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences in Jena, Germany. \u2018Prosocial behaviour [actions that help others] maybe helps people do well in harsh or unpredictable environments.\u2019 Together with other experts, he found that communities that believe in a high, controlling God or gods who enforce a moral code, tend to live in politically complex groups with a social hierarchy beyond the local community - and often tend to animals. While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre (Nescent) in Durham, North Carolina, implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. \u2018When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,\u2019 said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland. Here, devotees prepare ritual rice dishes to offer to the Hindu sun god as they attend Pongal celebrations, at a slum in Mumbai . The UK is one of the least religious places in the world, according to a new survey. In a global ranking of 65 countries, the UK came sixth from last, with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious. This compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are \u2018convinced atheists\u2019, with the remaining Britons saying they \u2018did not know\u2019. In contrast, 94 per cent of people in Thailand deem themselves religious, with Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia and Morocco completing the top five, with 93 per cent each. At the bottom of the list was China, where 61 per cent of people are atheists, with only six per cent regarding themselves as religious. It was followed by Japan where just 13 per cent are religious, Sweden with 19 per cent and the Czech Republic on 23 per cent. Globally two-thirds of people consider themselves religious. Those under the age of 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups, the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found. People without a formal education were also more likely to practice a faith. \u2018When researchers discuss the forces that shaped human history, there is considerable disagreement as to whether our behaviour is primarily determined by culture or by the environment,\" said primary author Carlos Botero, of North Carolina State University. \u2018We wanted to throw away all preconceived notions regarding these processes and look at all the potential drivers together to see how different aspects of the human experience may have contributed to the behavioural patterns we see today.\u2019 The study, published in PNAS, took into account variables associated with the environment, history, and culture and involved experts in biology, ecology, linguistics, anthropology, and theology. It began when evolutionary ecologist Dr Botero plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising, high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds. He took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion, and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation. Professor Gray said: \u2018Although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive, the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically, we get some insight.\u2019 While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study  implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. Here, Muslims on the outskirts of New Delhi participate in Friday prayers at a slum area during the holy month of Ramadan . The team used historical, social, and ecological data, such as plant growth, rain and temperature, for 583 societies to illustrate the multifaceted relationship between belief in moralising, high gods and external variables. They used the Ethograhic Atlas, which was collated during the last century, to pinpoint communities around the world and access data about religious beliefs, agriculture, and animal husbandry. \u2018The goal became not just to look at the ecological variables, but to look at the whole thing. 'Once we accounted for as many other factors as we could, we wanted to see if we could still detect an environmental effect,\u2019 Dr Botero said. \u2018The overall picture is that these beliefs are ultimately shaped by a combination of historical, ecological, and social factors.\u2019 Dr Botero believes that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in examining human behaviour from a cross-disciplinary standpoint. The team plans to further their study by exploring the processes that have influenced the evolution of other human behaviours including taboos, circumcision, and the modification of natural habitats. Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous - a phenomenon known as The Scrooge Effect, after the Dickens character (shown) Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous, according to a new study. It also boosts the feeling of pleasure we get from doing a good deed. \u2018Acting pro-socially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety, and in turn produces psychological satisfaction,\u2019 researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. The study builds on the terror management theory, which says that humans deal with our fear of death by believing in an afterlife or devoting our lives to a cause that will live on, Pacific Standard reported. Previous work found that Americans reminded of their own mortaility gave more money to a charity that said it would help people in the country, than one that had an international focus. It suggested that thoughts of death made people strengthen their beliefs - such as allegiance to a religion or country \u2013 and is known as The Scrooge Effect. The new study included an experiment, where people were asked to split $8 between themselves and a stranger, while reporting their own satisfaction. Before this, Polish student participants were asked to fill out a survey about death, or dealing with a trip to the dentists, then complete a crossword. The researchers found that volunteers who had previously thought about death gave more money to the stranger and said they felt happier doing it. The experiment seems to bolster The Scrooge Effect and suggests that reinforcing a person\u2019s self-image of being generous, or supporting a cause, are effective ways of managing fear of dying.",

Nobody else would get close. This has been his best season in a Chelsea shirt. Two seasons ago Rafa Benitez said he couldn\u2019t cope with two games a week. That will have frightened the life out of John. So credit Jose Mourinho for trusting him and building that defence around him. Terry has never had pace but that is not a problem as he reads the game so well. He didn\u2019t break sweat against Arsenal and Chelsea were too streetwise for Arsene Wenger\u2019s team. John Terry celebrates after the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium . Chelsea are undefeated against the top four this season where Arsenal have lost twice \u2014 that is the gap Wenger\u2019s side need to bridge and Terry has been a huge part of that. I remember playing against him early in his career and after I tackled Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, he clattered right into me \u2014 he wasn\u2019t going to let me put one on his team-mate. That\u2019s when I knew he could grow up to be a special player. Terry  celebrates with his team-mates after the Premier League draw against Arsenal in north London . One Hull of a result . Beating Crystal Palace was a massive result for Steve Bruce. Their run-in is horrendous and had they lost at Selhurst Park, surely it was all over. It shows how football fortunes can change in an instant. Hull are not the best away from home but as the stats below show, they thoroughly deserved their win. Dame N\u2019Doye was the star and could have had a hatful but I love the way he took his second. That little delay of his foot was just enough to put the defender off balance and give him a sight of goal before firing it in. Bruce had to move quickly to sign him on deadline day in February but N\u2019Doye has done well since joining from Lokomotiv Moscow. If he carries on like this and Hull stay up they might have to build a statue outside the ground! Dame N'Doye  celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Premier League win against Crystal Palace . Can Manuel still be the man? After recent results, people say Manuel Pellegrini is a dead man walking. Beating Aston Villa was important but can he keep his job under so much pressure? Deciding Pellegrini\u2019s fate will be one of the toughest choices Man City\u2019s owners have faced. I spoke to Frank Lampard and he says they are fantastic people \u2014 there is no desire to chop and change. City are so close. They have world class training facilities, an expanding stadium and absolute fortunes to spend. But this season has been a blip. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during the Premier League match against Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium . Pellegrini won two trophies last year, so they could keep him and let him rebuild. Recruitment has been poor and they need to get it right in the summer. But it\u2019s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year. If he is sacked, who gets the job? Pep Guardiola is the dream but it would take a major fallout for him to leave Bayern. Patrick Vieira has the tools but no experience, Jurgen Klopp would be appointed on past success and Diego Simeone is an underdog manager. City want style. There is no shame losing to Barcelona, it\u2019s the defeats to the likes of Burnley and Stoke that have hurt Pellegrini. City could still get rid of him, but I\u2019m sure it would be with a heavy heart. Manchester City are dreaming of Pep Guardiola but it's unlikely the Bayern boss will make the move to City . Flying Foxes . Talk about timing your run. Leicester are in amazing form. Four straight wins is good for any side, let alone one facing a relegation battle. It\u2019s been a tough season for Nigel Pearson with all the drama of him being \u2018sacked\u2019 and reinstated, but he has got his team flying at exactly the right time. Home disadvantage? There were only two home wins this weekend with three away and five draws. At this stage in the season sometimes it\u2019s far easier to play with freedom on the road than under huge pressure at home. Toon's poor show . The way Newcastle are going I would not be surprised if they don\u2019t get a single point between now and the end of the season. They have been an embarrassment. It\u2019s as if they are in the clubhouse with 35 points. They don\u2019t look like adding to that any time soon and anybody with Newcastle in their run-in has got a chance of a result. A deflated Jack Colback and Siem de Jong trudge off the pitch following yet another Newcastle defeat . The Newcastle players react as they suffer yet another defeat, this time to Premier League rivals Swansea . Chaos at Watford, but it works . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates scoring for Watford against Brighton at the Amex Stadium . Watford have spent 20 days at the top of the Championship table. Bournemouth, who are on the verge of promotion, have led for 111 days. Congratulations to Watford after their promotion, but if ever you want an example of how not to run a club, they have been it this season! With unpredictable owners, four different managers and a host of key players on loan, it has been chaos. They have been outsiders throughout but have come through when it counts. I\u2019ve loved watching Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo bang in the goals and you can\u2019t argue with the results. It just shows you there\u2019s no right or wrong in football. The Watford players celebrate victory against Brighton as they all but secure their promotion to the big time . United slip up . Two weeks ago Man United had all the answers but two defeats later it\u2019s back to the drawing board. It\u2019s not that they have been found out, but maybe they are not as good as people thought. They were just in good form. They have had the luxury of playing with no European football this season so still have work to do in the summer. It\u2019s the same feeling with Everton. They started the season dreadfully but have won five out of six. I\u2019m a Roberto Martinez fan and they have good players so we should not be surprised that things have changed. Louis van Gaal watches on as his Manchester United side are comprehensively beaten by Everton . Paying the penalty . Why oh why did Danny Ings not take that penalty for Burnley? Yes, he is out of form and without a goal since February but what better way to get back on the scoresheet? He took one against Aston Villa in November and scored and he and Burnley needed that goal. Then to make things worse Leicester go up the other end and score 27 seconds later. Burnley midfielder Matthew Taylor holds his head after missing the chance to score from the spot . It was a similar story at QPR. Charlie Austin\u2019s goals have kept his side going this season but he has missed two big penalties now \u2014 against Hull and West Ham. When every goal is so vital you can\u2019t afford to pass up these chances. PS If QPR go down, Austin won\u2019t be the only player with plenty of suitors. Matt Phillips has been scoring and setting up good goals in the run-in. He is a useful Premier League player. Charlie Austin looks on angrily following his penalty miss against West Ham United at Loftus Road .",

The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns . Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures . This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate. The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why. For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury. Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes. 'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.' Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis. Researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine in Chandigarh, India, believe injections of both substances will help regenerate worn-out cartilage, the tissues that cushions the joint. Stem cells have the ability to turn into different cell types. About 40 patients will be given injections of either stem cells and platelet-rich plasma or just platelet-rich plasma and the results compared.",

Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days after her initial report to police saying she was groped by Weinstein during a 'business meeting' at his office in Manhattan. It has been claimed the delay was because the Italian model and her manager were working behind the scenes to try and land her a film role. But once the 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to pursue the criminal case, sources told the New York Post. See below for video . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan last Friday night . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . After filing her police report on Friday, March 27, Battilana was eventually interviewed by Manhattan DA prosecutors on Wednesday, April 1, at the NYPD Special Victims Squad's office in East Harlem. Sources told the New York Post her former lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, withdrew from the case as he was concerned Battilana did not appear to be a 'serious victim'. The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and even tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat. But her new lawyer, David Godosky, refuted the claims, saying: 'She immediately went to the police, immediately cooperating with the Special Victims Squad.' Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse yesterday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Weinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall. The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night. She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported. Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'",

Residents from Fairdale,\u00a0an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could. But buildings in the settlement were virtually flattened when the vortex slammed into the area at around 7pm on Thursday night.

This aerial photo shows a path of destruction, after a tornado swept through the small town of Fairdale, Illinois . Residents from Fairdale, an unincorporated town 80 miles northwest of Chicago, were told they could return to their homes on Saturday to salvage what they could . The DeKalb County Sheriff's Office bused residents back to the scene of the devastation so they could begin to take stock of what was left of their property. Seeing the wreckage up close for the first time since Thursday's storms left some amazed that they survived. 'I thought my parents were dead,' said 32-year-old Adam Davis, who hopped into his truck Thursday and raced along with the tornado in the hopes of getting to his parents' house and rescuing them before the twister struck. He found them standing in their doorway frozen in disbelief and grabbed them just in time. On Saturday, he was helping collect what could be salvaged from his childhood home, now full of debris, its roof ripped off and its windows broken. 'It's not necessarily the mementos yet; it's the essentials for now. One step at a time,' he said. Eight tornadoes roared across northern and central Illinois during Thursday's storms, the National Weather Service confirmed Saturday. The strongest hit Fairdale, where two people were killed. That tornado also injured 22 people. Debris surrounds a plot where a house once stood in the farming community. Officials reported that 17 of the 50 buildings in the town are completely destroyed, while the other 33 have all been damaged in some way . The weather service gave it a preliminary EF4 rating \u2014 its second strongest \u2014 with winds of between 180 and 200 mph. It was a half-mile wide and remained on the ground for at least 28.7 miles, a record long path for that part of Illinois. Al Zammuto, a 60-year-old machinist, was preparing to inspect what was left of the roof on a former schoolhouse that he had been transforming into his home over the past year. He will have to start over. 'I don't know how much of the roof came off,' he said. 'I'm going to climb a ladder later today and see.' In all, some 70 buildings were destroyed or damaged in Fairdale, authorities said. Another 50 buildings were hit in nearby Rochelle. All buildings have been searched, but not all residents have been accounted for, so cadaver dogs are being used in parts of DeKalb County, the Illinois State Police said late Friday. The tornado blew numerous vehicles from nearby interstates, and troopers helped rescue a trapped driver in an overturned semi-trailer. As the cleanup began, tales of survival continued to emerge. The vortex created a path through the fields and wiped out a house as it made its way to the town. A building is left standing in a property above . Kelly Newman, 46, lost her Rochelle home. For her, the storm began with a moment of playful wonder at the size of the hail. She ran outside to collect some of the pieces to put it in the freezer to show her children. 'Then I noticed to the southwest there was a huge black funnel thing, but it didn't look like a tornado because it was just way too wide,' she said. But the telltale train-like roar sent them and their 19-year-old daughter running for the basement. The house cracked and collapsed around them, raining down debris and a dusting of what she described as 'muddy soot.' The family survived, and several police officers helped free her husband, who had been trapped nearly upside down between two collapsed walls. 'We're alive, we were spared. Our lives were saved,' she said. A destroyed house is seen in Fairdale is pictured on Friday, hours after a tornado ripped through the community .

Lyvette Crespo, 43, entered the plea to a grand jury indictment. She was ordered held on $150,000 bail and could face up to 21 years in state prison if convicted. Crespo shot Bell Gardens Mayor Daniel Crespo three times in the chest on September 30. The killing came after the late mayor's years of domestic abuse, the widow claims. However, the late Crespo's brother says those claims are all a lie and that he has evidence proving Mrs. Crespo is a cold-blooded killer. Indicted: Lyvette Crespo (right) allegedly shot her husband,\u00a0Bell Gardens, California Mayor Daniel Crespo (left), in September during a heated argument about his infidelity. She's now been indicted on charges of voluntary manslaughter . History of abuse? The Crespos were high school sweethearts. Mrs. Crespo claims her husband had become increasingly abusive in the months leading to his death. She says she shot him after he punched their son, who'd tried intervening during an argument . In text messages that brother, William Crespo, provided to the LA Times, Mrs. Crespo appears to have threatened to shoot her husband at least once before doing the deed. 'I'll find out who ... u got flowers for. Has to be a bell gardens wh***,' reads a message from Lyvette to her husband. Mr. Crespo replied: 'It better last time U threaten to shoot me in head!!!' In a civil suit filed against Lyvette on behalf of his mother, William Crespo has asked for more than $53 million in damages for the death of his brother, who he says was killed 'with malice and in cold blood,' by Mrs. Crespo. Crespo has told authorities it was self-defense after he punched their 19-year-old son in the face after he intervened in the couple's argument.

The mayor's position rotated among council members. He and his wife were high school sweethearts and married as teenagers in 1986. However, the autopsy report contained allegations by a daughter, Crystal Crespo, that her father had been verbally and physically abusive toward her mother over two decades. She said the abuse had become more physical in recent years because of arguments over Daniel Crespo's infidelity, but it was never reported and never left serious injuries. Daniel Crespo's brother, William Crespo, has denied the abuse allegations. The mayor's mother filed a $53 million lawsuit last fall in which she calls Crespo a 'cold-blooded killer' who picked a fight with her husband knowing their son would intervene. What happened?

Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment: \u00a0This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady\u2019s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead\u2019s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration:\u00a0Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nTehran, Iran (CNN)Traveling to Iran these days, the mood among many people and the government can probably best be described using two words: confident and optimistic. After a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between Iran and world powers, many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon. Businesses are already gearing up for a time after the restrictions are lifted, and many people anticipate a huge boost to the economy. \"Naturally we are all very happy,\" one woman in central Tehran told us. \"We expect better days economically and culturally. We want better relations with the rest of the world.\" Another man added, \"I have a good feeling about it, because my country will be free of the fear of war.\" But this weekend, just a few miles down the road, Iran's leaders were celebrating their war machine as the military held its annual National Army Day parade. As the U.S., Saudi Arabia and other countries criticize Iran for its alleged involvement in funding and supplying the Houthi rebels who have seized power in much of Yemen, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has praised the military as peacemakers for the Middle East. \"Today, our army is the source of our national stability,\" Rouhani said in his speech at the parade. \"And even more than that -- it is also a source of security and stability in the entire region.\" The country's top military brass seemed surprisingly relaxed and unusually willing to speak with Western media outlets. Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, the Chief of Staff of Iran's armed forces and a man who is close to Rouhani, told CNN he hopes the U.S. and Iran can work closer together to fight ISIS in Iraq. \"The unity of humanity based on the right of all human beings to live, and their right to freedom, dictates that all human society is threatened by ISIS, and all humans should unite against ISIS and work against them,\" Firouzabadi said. Firouzabadi also repeated Iran's longstanding claim that the U.S. is partly responsible for creating ISIS, which now controls large parts of Iraq and Syria. \"If the Americans really didn't create ISIS, and if they want to destroy ISIS, it is possible for them to achieve that,\" he said. \"But we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the U.S. and Britain. We hope that one day, because of their national interests and the will of their nations, the U.S. and the UK will decide to really fight ISIS.\" Iran has often dismissed the coalition air campaign as ineffective, while praising its own strategy of training, advising, outfitting and directing Iraqi Shia militias, Kurdish forces and the Iraqi military. But in another apparent softening of rhetoric, a top military official said he hopes that the animosity between Iran and America will fade. \"At the moment, we consider the United States to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us,\" General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, the commander of Iran's ground forces, told CNN. \"We would like the U.S. to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in the U.S. military leadership,\" Pourdastan continued. \"We trust the American people, but the tone of U.S. government and military officials is such that we still consider the U.S. a threat.\" At the same time, Iran's leadership is showing no sign of toning down its own fiery rhetoric -- and the usual \"Death to Israel, death to the U.S.A.\" chants echoed around the crowds at the military parade. The U.S. welcomes some of Iran's support for Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS, but says at this point that there simply is no basis for deeper cooperation on the battlefield. And for Iran's part, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also rejected direct coordination between the two long-time adversaries. And even though many Iranians have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal, the leadership in Washington and Tehran is far more skeptical. In a recent televised speech, Khamenei said it was possible that there would be no deal by the June 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all. And Iran's army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites. Meanwhile, the White House has been confronted by a Congress that is largely hostile to the negotiations, and has been making the case that a deal cannot be about trust, but about monitoring and verification. \"Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't abide by its agreement, that we don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said last Friday. \"That's our main concern. And I think that goal, of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation, that goal can be met.\" So far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week. But despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air, there is also fear that things could fall apart if Tehran and Washington aren't willing to make tough concessions.",

Patients at Wolfson Children's Hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them. Scroll down for video . The toys include a long 'tail' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. The Idaho firm behind the system\u00a0has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the US, letting anyone play with cats via the system - and plans to sell a version for pet owners via Kickstarter next month. 'Play through programs like the Play with Cats project has a powerful normalizing effect on a child's hospital stay,' said Wolfson Children's Hospital President Michael Aubin. Patients who are in isolation with a specific treatment or a chronic medical condition like cystic fibrosis or bone marrow transplant will be among the first to benefit. Made possible with a $15,000 grant from the Mattel Children's Foundation, the Play with Cats program connects to 151 hospital rooms throughout Wolfson Children's Hospital via GetWellNetwork. The Wolfson Children's Hospital Auxiliary first started a Pet Therapy Program in 1995. Two years ago, the hospital opened a pet visitation program, allowing children with long-term stays or in end-of-life situations to receive a visit from their own dog. 'This is the latest program to be implemented at Wolfson Children's Hospital to give more of our patients a chance to interact with a kitten or cat, which provides a welcome distraction.' said Pat Kirkland, Family Support Services Manager at Wolfson Children's Hospital. 'About 20 percent of our patients are on isolation at some time during their stay, so we are excited to bring the healing power of an animal friend to the bedside.' 'Our partnership with Wolfson Children's Hospital began with JHS veterinarians providing required vet checks and vaccines that allow patients in the hospital to visit with their own dogs. 'We are proud to expand the partnership using iPet so that all patients may benefit from the healing power of animals,' said Denise Deisler, executive director of the Jacksonville Humane Society. The system was developed by Idaho firm ReachIn. 'The idea came from the ability to move anything over the web,' Scott Harris of the firm told MailOnline. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. 'We started working on the technical side of remote control, and then an engineer went home to work on arm overnight. The next day he came in, took me to one side and said he'd been moving the arm, and his cat had started playing with it. He admitted he then hadn't got any work done and spent the evening watching the cat play - so I thought we might be on to something.' The firm contacted a local animals shelter and worked with them to build three toys. In May 2012, the first catcam went online, and was a huge success. Users join a virtual queue, and can then control three toys and a webcam in the enclosure. The iCompanion site that visitors play with cats in rescue homes around the US virtually . Now the firm plans to expand the idea after huge interest from shelters. Users from 90 countries played within 2 weeks playing, and adoption rates went up 57% at shelters, said Harris. The firm is now trying to work out how to fund the systems after over 300 charities got in touch wanting it. The firm is launching a kickstarter campaign to allow people to buy their own version of the system on May 1st. Users can control a variety of toys in the enclosures . 'it costs us to build these things and maintain them, and 317 shelters have requested it, so we are working with as many as we can.' The firm hopes to develop a low cost version costing around $200 for shelters, but admits the R&D costs are currently too high. The user is shown a live video feed to they can see their cat reacting to the toys . Kitten cam! Cats at a shelter in the Us play wiht the internet controlled toys .",

Marcelo and Mario Suarez were both booked during the 0-0 draw at the Vicente Calderon and due to accumulation of yellow cards will not be present during the return at the Santiago Bernabeu. Neither player were happy with referee Milorad Mazic, both feeling that their challenges weren't strong enough to be punished with a card.

Suarez has blasted the performance of referee Milorad Mazic after being booked on Tuesday night . Suarez expressed his frustration after the game, saying on Spanish TV: 'The referee is very bad. They can't use a Serbian referee for these type of games, with all my respect. 'I hope that in the return leg they pick a better referee.' His comment could result in matches being added to his one-game suspension. The midfielder published a statement on Twitter after the game, reading: 'I'd like to apologise if anyone has been offended by my words after the game, it was not my intention. 'I meant to say that games of this magnitude should be given to a referee from one of the big leagues. Nothing more, we all make mistakes. Lets keep working. #AupaAtleti.'

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)In 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called \"comfort women\" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the \"comfort women\" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the \"comfort women\" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the \"comfort women.\" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national \"coming to terms with the past\" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving \"comfort women\" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.",

Monk's men have enjoyed an excellent campaign by being in the top 10 all season and are currently in eighth place with the club's best Barclays Premier League points total in sight. Swansea have eight more games to collect the five points needed to beat the 47-point mark posted in their inaugural Premier League campaign in 2011-12. Garry Monk is out to claim a season-first against Hull by picking up a point after an international break . The Swansea boss gestures towards his striker Bafetimbi Gomis during a training session this week . It is a campaign which has exceeded so many expectations but Swansea have yet to pick up a point after an international break this term, although in mitigation those have been away games at Chelsea, Stoke and Manchester City.

'You see how well they did in those games, make sure there's nothing from that and then select your side. 'But I don't read too much into those games we've had after the international break because we've been unlucky in some of them.' Wayne Routledge (right) marked by Kyle Naughton during the session as Swansea prepare for Hull . Swansea captain Ashley Williams (centre) in training as they look to end their post-international break duck . Swansea are seeking a double over relegation-troubled Hull after winning 1-0 at the KC Stadium just before Christmas. But Monk says games between the two clubs have always been tight affairs and he is not expecting anything different this time. 'I watched their last game against Chelsea and thought they performed extremely well and were unlucky to lose,' Monk said. 'We've always had close games with Hull. It's a tough physical game with them but they have got quality to hurt us if we're not on our game. 'This is it, the business end of the season and everyone's fighting for their own reasons. 'Hull are trying to stay away from danger at the bottom of the table, they will be very determined and we have to be prepared for that. 'But we're in good form at the moment and we're trying to push on and focus on our own agenda.'",

Diwalinen Vankar, 58, had gone with her 19-year-old daughter Kanta, to the bank of the Vishwamitri River, 40 kilometres from Vadodara, in west India, to wash their clothes. As they were wringing out their laundry, a mugger crocodile grabbed Kanta's right leg and dragged her into the murky river. Diwalinen Vankar, 58, (pictured left) fought off a 13ft crocodile with a washing paddle after it attacked her 19-year-old daughter Kanta (right) A crocodile grabbed\u00a0Diwalinen Vankar's daughter's legs on the banks of the\u00a0Vishwamitri River in west India and dragged her into the river - her mother rescued her by hitting it with a washing paddle (stock image) The sudden attack rattled Vankar, who hastily grabbed her daughter's hand to try and pull her free from the clutches of the crocodile. But the mugger crocodile clasped its powerful jaws round her daughter with its razor-sharp teeth. Vankar said: 'I was using all my force to pull her back, but the crocodile was so powerful I could not move her an inch. 'For a moment I felt the crocodile would drown my daughter as it tried to roll into the water.' But the quick-thinking mother then decided to attack the crocodile - that can grow up to 15 feet long - with her washing paddle. 'For several minutes I tried to pull her with my hands, but then I got hold of the wooden bat and started hitting its head forcefully', she said. 'Her leg was trapped between the piercing teeth as she cried in pain, her hands were scratching the river bank to get a grip but it didn't let her go. 'It took me 10 minutes to finally free her from its jaws.' Kanta suffered a leg injury after the crocodile grabbed her right leg and dragged her into the murky river . This map shows the Vishwamitri River, near Vadodara, where the attack by the crocodile took place . Vankar said she went to wash her clothes in the river as there was a lack of water and electricity in the village . After hearing the commotion, villagers rushed to help and drove Kanta to hospital, where doctors were treated her for a leg injury. She has since been discharged. Speaking from the hospital, her mother said: 'I thank God for saving my daughter. The injuries are not that serious and doctors say she will be fine in sometime.' She said they had been forced to wash their clothes in the river because of a shortage of water and electricity in the village, but vowed never to return. A wildlife officer said the river is home to ferocious crocodiles and villagers have been warned to steer clear of the river. 'She has miraculously survived. These crocodiles are huge and ferocious,' Ashok Pandya, Vadodara wildlife officer told the Times of India. 'We have been warning them not to go near the river.' Last year, six people were killed in crocodile attacks across Vadodara. There are more than 200 crocodiles in the\u00a0Vishwamitri River.

The Labor Department reported on Thursday that the number of jobless Americans in their 20s armed with a four-year or advanced degree rose to 12.4per cent last year from 10.9per cent in 2013. Philip Gardner, director of Michigan State University's Collegiate Employment Research Institute, told the Associated Press that engineering and business majors have the most chance on landing a job in today's competitive market. Hire me! The unemployment rate for college graduates grew by 1.5per cent in 2014, despite President Obama's promise to reverse the trend (stock photo) And Holly Proffitt, employer relations coordinator in the career services office at Arkansas State University, confirmed Gardner's observations. 'We can't graduate enough engineers,' she said. Despite the recent news, in a survey\u00a0of employers last fall by Michigan State University, the employment center found that hiring of graduates  will rise 16per cent this year. Indeed, the consulting and accounting firm EY is aggressively recruiting on college campuses this spring. It plans to hire 9,000 graduates from U.S. universities this year, up from 7,500 in 2014. The overall unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5per cent in March from 6.7per cent at the end of 2013. Apparently employers have more openings to fill because Baby Boomers are retiring and more workers are feeling confident enough about the economy to switch jobs. Overall, the United States generated 3.1 million jobs last year, the most since 1999. In particular, employer demand for so-called STEM graduates - in science, technology, engineering and mathematics - was highest. Offering hope to non-STEM students, Gardner said of the future job market: 'There seems to be a lot of room for everybody. . . \u00a0Even arts and humanities are making a comeback.'",

When the reality TV star once shared a snap mid-way through her makeover revealing her contouring tricks, a new beauty craze was born. And now, the secret behind the 34-year-old reality TV star's glowing skin has been revealed. Scroll down for video . Want to look like Kim Kardashian? Now you can, because the flawless star has revealed the products that give her that envy-inducing glow . The mother-of-one, who shared her beauty essentials on Instagram, protects her skin with a \u00a365 ($96) Creme de la Mer\u00a0SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, which claims to prevent the appearance of discolorations while providing protection from the sun. The cream, which is packed with gemstones, peculiar sounding 'photonic spheres' and smart seaweeds, can also be used as a make-up primer. Kim shared her beauty essentials on her Instagram page and, of course, a hairbrush from her own brand featured . Kim then loves to spritz her face with a \u00a312 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier. The little-known product is made with roses and aloe and aims to to hydrate, soothe, and leave you feeling fresh and awake. The brand say the product is also 'excellent as a make-up refresher and midday pick-me-up'. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a NARS face wash and Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System. The NARS Gentle Cream Cleanser apparently helps to maintain skin's moisture balance while removing makeup and impurities. Meanwhile, the vibrating brush uses a micro-massage motion, which is said to work within skin's natural elasticity to gently remove the impurities traditional methods leave behind-leaving skin softer, smoother and more beautiful. Clearly it's working for Kim. Other beauty essentials in her cosmetics bag include a hairbrush from her own range, Kardashian Beauty, which she established with her sisters, as well as an Essie nail polish. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Kim said: 'As far as products, I love the Kardashian Beauty dry shampoo and conditioner, which we have. I've never seen a dry conditioner out there but it really helps when you're trying to not wash your hair.' Another product the sisters swear by is coconut oil, which they say is 'everything'. 'When I take off my make-up, I use avocado oil or coconut oil and I also sleep in it, it's amazing for dry hair,' explained Khloe. 'You can put it on your body, too. Coconut oil can do everything.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping'. The brow groomer uses the Dipbrow Pomade, which she applies with her \u00a315.50 Brow Wiz, an ultra-fine brow pencil, which claims to fill in sparse brows for a naturally fuller appearance. She then defines and enhances the brows with her \u00a317 Brow Powder Duo, which is enriched with Vitamins C and E to nourish and protect, before sealing the powder make-up into place with her \u00a315 Beauty Genius Clear Waterproof Gel, which she says seals and waterproofs any loose powder. To remove the day's face, Kim uses a Black Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, left,\u00a0loves to spritz her face with a \u00a312 ($18) rose water mist from Glossier, centre, and protect her skin from the sun with\u00a0a \u00a365 ($96) Creme de la Mer SPF 30 UV Protecting Fluid, right . As well as running a successful beauty empire with her sisters, Kim has revealed that she wants to design a range of handbags for toddlers. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star - who has 22-month-old daughter North with husband Kanye West - is set to launch her Kardashian Kids collection next week and has revealed she's already thinking about adding more accessories to the range. Asked about designing shoes or handbags, she told Vogue.com: 'Well, North does love handbags. And anything where there's a little bit of glitz.' When it comes to grooming her brows, Kim calls on Anastasia Soare, who is known in Tinseltown as 'the queen of eyebrow shaping' The 34-year-old beauty admits that while her daughter is a big fan of fancy shoes, she's not so keen on the range of headbands included in her mother's new collection. Kim explained: 'Every day she wakes up and says, \"shoes\". You have to bargain with her - before you change her diaper she needs a pair of shoes on ... She hasn't been the biggest fan of keeping something on her head.' Kardashian Kids launches on Nordstrom.com on April 13 with prices ranging between $25 (\u00a316.80) and $35 (\u00a323.60) and Kim admits that while she did a lot of research online, she also drew inspiration from her own wardrobe which is why the collection features pieces such as peplum tops and faux leather leggings.

Jenny-Lee, 28, was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy, and although doctors at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy, she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion. However her mother Heather has told The Daily Telegraph that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child, named Aroura. 'She knew chemo would kill Aroura \u2014 she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened, she wanted that baby alive,' Heather said. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . 'We were told she would have six weeks to live \u2014 she fought to have the baby. That's the decision she made \u2014 she gave up her life.' Instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter's unnecessary death, claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner, but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy. The Sydney mother's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. Jenny-Lee's elder daughter Chelsie, who was only 10 when her mother died in August 2009, also defended her mother. However the 28-year-old's brother David blamed the religion for how his sister died, calling her a 'fool'. 'It was not my sister who was sad and selfish, it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense,' he said. Jenny-Lee, 28, had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' She was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a\u00a0challenge\u00a0to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. In a recent article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber\u00a0Biscoe wrote:\u00a0'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.

The scathing critics told the six-months pregnant meteorologist Kristi Gordon that her 'front end looks like the Hindenburg\u00a0and your rear end looks like a brick s***house.' Fans jumped to support her when Gordon read out excerpts from the letters and emails on TV, but it seems that abuse of pregnant TV presenters daring to get on with their jobs during their pregnancy is nothing new. Australian presenter and model Nicky Buckley famously soldiered on with her presenting job on The Sale of the Century after falling pregnant in 1997, continuing to wear the glamorous, figure-hugging gowns her job required of her. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the barrage of abuse that was bestowed upon my unborn baby and me by a multitude of critics who were determined to dampen the joyous marvel of pregnancy,' Buckley, now 49, writes in her newly-released memoir. Scroll down for video . Pregnant and proud: Buckley copped heavy criticism for showing bump on TV but stood her ground . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about the book, 'Nicky Buckley: A Memoir', she shared just how bad the criticism became. 'I was told I jammed fax machines at Channel 9 and newspapers - with faxes coming in from people commenting negatively.' 'At the time there wasn't any maternity wear except kaftans which covered you from head to toe, hiding your boobs and bump,' she said. Bitterness over bump: Buckley wore sexy dresses that revealed her bump, \u00a0shocking TV audiences, and hit back in magazine interviews saying she refused to bend to critics . TV Scandal: Nicky Buckley enraged public by staying on air throughout her nine month pregnancy . Family first: Buckley bucked preconceived notions of women in TV and continued to work to support family . As her role was to wear glamorous evening dresses and there wasn't adequate maternity wear available, she  just went up a size from her usual attire and got on with things. 'I wasn't out to raise the flag or cause a stir, I simply wanted to work \u2013 as was my right. Yet in doing so people had other opinions and thought I shouldn't be seen publicly with a bump.' 'I had a mortgage, people tend to forget  and put you in a bubble. But I still had a mortgage and do you think I should just stop and be taken off the air?' Game model: Game show host and model copped flack for her bump and continued to work to pay the bills . Glamorous to gritty: Despite her glamour role, Buckley says the pregnancy showed the ugly side to TV . 'I needed to pay the bills and I was happy with what's going on,' she said. 'Looking back I'm proud of how strong I was. I can't push the point hard enough, I was steadfast and strong, I was going to work and do my job.' 'I couldn't wait to share the news with my girlfriends but after the usual squeals of congratulations  they said \"what are you going to do about work?' she reflects in the book. A friend even made the shocking suggestion to Buckley that they could build her a podium to stand behind once she started to show. Host to husband: Buckley married her co-host Murray Bingham and subsequently had three children with him . While taken aback, she said she believes people saw her role as glamorous one and being pregnant clearly didn't fit with that image. 'Despite my blossoming belly and impending birth, unintentionally I had sparked a very public debate that divided a nation - was pregnancy  something to be ashamed of? Were pregnant women even attractive?  said Buckley. Not to mention the dress she wore on the runway at a Myer Fashion Festival that saw eyebrows raised. 'That caused a real stir. It was a dress with a cut out heart over the belly, people saw it outrageous but the designer and I thought it was beautiful and embraced the bump and fashion all at the same time.' Nearly 50 and fabulous: Buckley now at nearly 50 is celebrating her age with release of her memoir . The book: Buckley's memoir on sale now for $29.99 .",

Husband Yin Yunfeng spent the last week of his annual holiday making all sorts of stir-fried dishes as well as about 1,000 dumplings as a way to show his love to his wife, according to thePeople's Daily Online. Treasure chest: Ms Zhao has enough food to last for a year prepared by her husband . Feast: The husband, Yin Yunfeng, spent a week cooking all sorts of stir-fried dishes . All-you-can-eat: He also made about 1,000 dumplings before returning to his regiment in Tibet . The devoted husband is worried that his wife would be eating instant noodles all the time so he cooked different types of dishes and put them into small foam containers to be frozen.

'Although I mentally prepared myself for this life when I married him, I had no idea it would be so tough,' sais Ms Zhao. 'At the end of every holiday I would be devastated and would cry all day but I will continue to support him in his career and look after this family.' She added: 'The food he prepared is enough for me for one year and every time I think of this my heart is warm.' In addition to meals, Mr Yin has also bought a large amount of snacks and hid them in different corners of the house as daily surprises to his wife.

'Today you have been studying very hard and I have a reward for you. Behind the sofa on the right there is a gap and I have left you a packet of raisins,' reads one of the messages. The snacks include chips, pumpkin seeds, chewing gum, biscuits, beef jerky and instant noodles. Yin said he hoped he would be home by the time his wife finishes the food and snacks.",

Schuyler is such a champ that the four teams of two that competed against her didn't even come close to winning - even though they were allowed to split their dinners. Scroll down for video . Winner, winner, steak dinner: Molly Schuyler won the 72-ounce steak dinner challenge at the Big Texan Steack Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas on Sunday . Fast eater: The 120-pound mother-of-four ate three steak dinners - complete with sides - in just 20 minutes . Worth it: For breaking the record for quickest steak dinner eaten and for finishing her three meals in under an hour, Schuyler took home a grand total of $6,000 . In addition to the three massive 72-ounce steaks, competitors also had to eat three baked potatoes, three shrimp cocktails, three salads and three rolls for a whopping 15 pounds of food. While that might sound daunting to most, Schuyler was confident that she would beat out the other competitors with her experience. 'They would have had to eat their half in like four minutes,' Schuyler told the Amarillo Globe-News. 'If you\u2019re not used to doing this, four minutes is hard.' Filling: The dinner included three 72-ounce steaks, three shrimp cocktails, three baked potatoes, three salads and three rolls . Champion: Though her competitors were allowed to tackle the challenge in teams of two, none came close to winning the competition . She cleaned her plate: Schuyler poses with a fan after the feat, showing off her belly bloated from the competition . However, she was a bit nervous about tackling a three steak dinners since she ate just two when she competed at the restaurant last year. 'I come in thinking I'm going to fail, but you know if I win it's a lovely parting gift and that's cool,' she told KFDA-TV. 'I also get free steak so I don't really lose.' As the competition began, Schuyler covered up with a pair of sunglasses and put up her sweatshirt hood to focus on the task at hand and finished her first steak in just four minutes and 18 seconds - beating the previous record she set last year of four minutes and 48 seconds. Hundreds cheered her on below the competition table set up side the restaurant on a sunny day, as Schuyler ripped her way through the steaks. Competitors had an hour to finish their $72 dinners, in order to get them for free, but Schuyler cleaned her plates in a cool 20. And with enough time to spare, Schuyler tried attacking a fourth steak but had to stop, saying she was tired of the taste. Schuyler was born and raised in Nebraska and currently residents in Sacramento California. Before her competitive food eating life, she worked as a bartender and server at Applebee\u2019s. In August 2012, Schuyler entered her first competitive eating competition, becoming the first woman to finish the Stellanator at Stella Bar in Omaha, Nebraska. The Stellanator includes six hamburger patties, six eggs, six pieces of cheese, six pieces of bacon topped with fried onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, two buns and mayonnaise. Another to add to the trophy cabinet: Schuyler pictured above winning the Z-Burger contest in Washington, DC last July. During the competition she ate 24 hamburgers in ten minutes . Since then, Schuyler has been competing regularly in food eating competitions - including one weekend in 2014 when she competed in FOUR food competitions. On January 31, 2014, Schuyler won Wing Bowl 22 in Philadelphia, by eating 363 wings. The next day, she competed in and won both the IHOP Pancake bowl and the bacon-eating contest at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival in Des Moines. She finished out the weekend by taking on the Adam Emmenecker Challenge at Jethro\u2019s Barbecue. Schuyler first took on the Emmenecker challenge in December 2012, when she became the first woman to complete the meal that includes a spicy pickle, bun, pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken tenders, white cheddar sauce, fried cheese cubes, Texas brisket, applewood smoked bacon, cheeseburger and a pound of waffle fries...in just 15 minutes. Dessert: Schuyler guzzles down\u00a012 pounds of rice pudding in three minutes to set a new world record last year . Hero: Last year Mrs Schuyler smashed another record by demolishing a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda as part of the Mad Greek Deli Challenge in Portland, Oregon . Schuyler started the competition at her normal 120 pounds, but by the time she was crowned winner, she had gained 15 pounds and her stomach noticeably filled out. Her physique was quite a contrast to the larger men who decided to take her on in the eating competition including a team of two professional wrestlers and two members of the Amarillo Venum indoor football team. For setting the record for fastest eaten steak dinner, Schuyler won $1,000 and another $5,000 for completing the challenge in less than an hour. What's more - Schuyler says she plans to come back next year and break her record, upping the ante to four steaks instead of three. Bobby Lee, the co-owner of the Big Texas, says the restaurant was floored by her performance and that they'll be submitting her record to Guinness. 'We've been doing this contest since 1960, and in all that time we've never had anybody come in to actually eat that many steaks at one time- so this is a first for us and after 55 years of it, it's a big deal,' Lee told ABC 7. Schuyler started competing in eating competition in August 2012, and has broken several records during her brief career. In January 2014, she set ate 363 wings in just 20 minutes, earning $22,000 prize for that competition.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nSirloin, topside and fillet are best saved for the roasting pan, chuck flank, rib-eye and skirt on the grill and when stewing go for brisket, shoulder and ribs. If you're roasting a joint this Sunday, remember that thyme and red wine make perfect partners and don't forget to scrape the roasting dish for juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. And when looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts that have a good marbling of fat. Research by Asda has found that rump, fillet and T-Bone are the most popular cuts of meat when eating out but when we cook at home the majority of us (55 per cent) rely on burgers or mince. The supermarket's study also showed a showing lack of beef knowledge in the under 35's, which was highlighted further by the extensive knowledge of their senior counterparts. One in four youngsters think pocket and Y-bone are cuts of beef, whereas only a mere 3 per cent of over 55s fell for the fake cuts. In addition, this age bracket correctly identified shin (78 per cent) and skirt (72 per cent) as cuts of beef widely available across the UK but for the younger folk, those figures more than halved. Over a quarter of under 35's avoid trying unusual cuts of beef because they assume it will be too expensive while 30 per cent admitted they had never been shown how to cook a cut of beef. A fifth of 18-34-year-olds also admitted they find larger cuts of beef daunting to cook. Although half of Brits in their 20s would happily choose rump steak on the menu at a restaurant, they lack the confidence or know-how to cook it at home and therefore rely on the staples of mince and burgers to feed their beefy cravings. Neil Moorcroft buying manager for beef at Asda said: 'It's probably fair to say our grandparent's generation are more likely to have been brought up on a varied diet of beef cuts depending on what was available from the local butcher. 'However busy lifestyles and a shift in family mealtimes has altered this over the years, which is why it's become easy to fall into the same old shopping and cooking routines. 'But it's never too late to experiment and beef up those cooking skills, so if you get stuck just ask for tips at your local butcher's counter'. 'Bigger cuts of meat can be daunting, but they have great versatility, value for money and are definitely worth getting to grips with.' Best for Roasting . Preparing a roast can be daunting, but the cuts below are always a safe bet for any Sunday roast. Sirloin . Topside . Top Rump . Fillet . Get your roast on: . 1. Allow it to reach room temperature before cooking. 2. On a medium to high hob heat, seal the beef joint in a large frying pan with a touch of oil ensuring all sides are sealed by turning the joint every two to three minutes. 3. Transfer to a oven roasting dish and seasoning with salt and pepper, place into a preheated oven (190c/fan 170c) and allow to cook for 20 minutes per 500g for a juicy medium cooked joint. 4. Remove meat from roasting tray and allow to rest on a plate in a warm area for 15-20 minutes before serving use the roasting dish and juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. 5. Thyme and red wine is a perfect partner for roast beef. Best for Grilling . When looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts which have a good marbling of fat and also a tender joint which doesn't need to be beaten or stewed in order to bring out the flavours. Go for: . Flank . Skirt . Sirloin . Ribeye bone-in . Become a grill master: . 1. If you've bought a cheaper cut such as flank or top blade then marinating these meats first (overnight if possible) will really help to tenderize them . 2. Use a red hot grill pan which sizzles when you add the steak and try not to push it around or turn it too quickly if you want to create those famous griddle marks . 3. Similarly to a roast, let the steaks rest for five minutes before eating to allow meat to relax and become more tender. Best for Stewing . These cuts of beef are often the most cost effective because they require that extra bit of love and care in the kitchen, but don't let the time put you off. The flavours are well worth the wait for a tasty bubbling stew. Brisket . Shoulder . Beef ribs . Shank . Stew your way to success: . 1. Low and slow is the key phrase here, so get yourself a heavy bottomed casserole pot or slow cooker, and plenty of stock to allow for a long slow cook . 2. Preparation is easy, any veg can simply been thrown in at the start and left to bubble away . 3. Four hours should result in tender chunks of beef ready to accompany sides such as mash, dumplings or Yorkshire puds .",

And the Camerons seemed to have taken it rather too literally, with both David and Samantha getting stuck in with blue paint while on the campaign trail. While Mr Cameron was messing about with Boris Johnson in Surbiton, his wife was 200 miles away in West Yorkshire giving a lick of paint to a charity project. Scroll down for video . Samantha Cameron picked up a paintbrush to help at The Growing Zone allotment project, a community project for children and adults with special needs . The Prime Minister's wife was campaigning with Conservative candidate\u00a0Alec Shelbrooke (centre) in the seat of Elmet and Rothwell . Mrs Cameron has made several solo appearances during the election campaign in key seats, today supporting Tory candidate\u00a0Alec Shelbrooke in\u00a0Elmet and Rothwell. She visited the Growing Zone, an allotment garden project for adults and children with special needs in Kippax, West Yorkshire. She was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon. Mrs Cameron was even persuaded to help paint a wooden plant stand, which is being reconditioned and brought back into use by the volunteers and children. Mrs Cameron was introduced to various activities by June Perkin, who founded the scheme seven years ago after getting disillusioned by aimless families and youngsters she watched in a Leeds shopping centre one afternoon . Mrs Cameron said the best thing about campaigning was 'getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June' 'It's great to be in Yorkshire,' Mrs Cameron said. 'The best thing about a campaign is getting out and about - meeting amazing people like June. 'The Growing Zone is an inspiration. It's been lovely meeting everybody here today and seeing what an amazing job they do changing the lives of so many people with disabilities.' Mrs Cameron made her first appearance of the campaign in Rochester and Strood, which was won in a by-election by Ukip's Mark Reckless after he defected from the Tories last year. She joined her husband on a whistlestop tour of the UK, visiting Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland in a single day, and at the weekend the couple visited a Sikh temple in Gravesend. Mrs Perkin said of Mrs Cameron's visit: 'It was absolutely brill. Using the words the kids here use, it was cool. She had a good look round and she was very, very interested. 'She understood everything we're doing and what we're about. And the kids loved it. Do you see their faces?' After taking nine minutes to complete a puzzle, Boris Johnson and David Cameron were relieved to try their hand at hand painting, which they found much easier . The pair were at the nursery in Surbiton to promote a Tory pledge to double free childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week . Describing her inspiration for the project, Mrs Perkin said she had been sitting on her allotment one night, sipping a gin and tonic and thinking how great the environment was compared with the shopping centre where she had got so angry earlier in the day. She said: 'I just thought that these people here, on the allotment, have got things right. 'There's no point moping, I may as well get on with it. So I just grabbed a spade and here we are now.' She said many of the volunteer helpers are retired people who can do as much or as little as they like on the colourful site. There were 3,000 separate visits by children from a wide area last year, Mrs Perkin said. Meanwhile, at a nursery in Surbiton, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson were\u00a0left scratching their heads today as they struggled with a children's jigsaw teaching toddlers about the seasons. As the London Mayor tried to hammer ill-fitting pieces together with his hands, the Prime Minister tried out what could be a new election slogan, telling him: 'If in doubt, wedge it in.' After being put right by a four-year-old who spotted their errors, the pair had more fun finger painting with Tory blue paint.",

The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for \u00a3130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out \u00a3130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget \u00a319.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of \u00a319.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, \u00a3130:\u00a0Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene\u00a0and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the\u00a0Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At \u00a3130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of \u00a3130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, \u00a319.99:\u00a0The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for \u00a314.99 in 2013. Aldi's \u00a319.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty.\u00a0But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas:\u00a0The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the\u00a0Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At \u00a319.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the \u00a3130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.",

The 39-year-old was on the ninth hole when he found himself 470 yards away from the pin with the ball nestled in pine straws. However when he followed through, the four-time champion at Augusta slammed the club into a root, causing him to wince and grab his hand in agony. It forced the joint out of place, but Woods shunned medical attention and simply pushed it back in himself. Tiger Woods looks in agony after his club came into contact with a tree root on the ninth hole at Augusta. He later revealed his wrist bone had 'popped out' of place . The 39-year-old is clearly in agony as he is forced to drop his club on the follow through . He then grabs his wrist and winces. After finishing his round he revealed that his wrist bone had popped out - so he was forced to put it back in . His reaction prompted concerns he may have suffered another injury setback. However he managed to shake off the scare and finish his round. Woods, playing in his 20th Masters tournament, ended up at 5-under-par on 283, tied for 17th. 'It hurts; it definitely hurts,' Woods said. 'I didn't know there was a tree root there. I drilled the club straight into it. It didn't move, but my body kept moving. 'There's a little joint that popped out, and I was able to somehow put it back in, which didn't feel very good. 'At least I got it back in; I could move my hand again. It's sore. I'm not going to be lifting any weights for a while.' He also admitted that he may not return to the course for a while. Despite finishing\u00a013 strokes behind 21-year-old winner Jordan Spieth, this was Woods' best finish in a tournament in over a year. Spieth became the youngest winner since Woods when he was given the coveted green jacket on Sunday. After his final putt he went an embraced his tearful childhood sweetheart Annie Verret. The Texan native, whose life-long dream has been to win the Masters, was undoubtedly being watched on television at home by his youngest sibling, Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Ellie has helped to keep Spieth grounded, according to their mother. Speaking after his win, Spieth said: 'It was very nerve-wracking today. I didn't sleep all last night. Just got out here and got in a little rhythm. With two major champions right behind, I couldn't let up. It was the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It was remarkable. He added: 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green there, and knew it was going to be a done deal. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit.' Spieth's victory comes a year after he lost a bid to become the youngest player to win the Masters. This year, he did not let anyone get closer to him than three shots following his record start. He closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set another record. The four-time Masters champion managed to shake off the injury to finish the competition at 5-under-par . 21-year-old Jordan Spieth (centre) celebrates his first Masters victory with his girlfriend Annie Verret on Sunday .

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called \"Bali Nine.\" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, \"don't judge me too harshly.\"  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  \"A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life.\" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, \"The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options.\" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the \"extensive rehabilitation\" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to \"use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.\"",

Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when\u00a0he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably\u00a0not his either. Instead, it records the\u00a0date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny'\u00a0Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return\u00a0the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence was under fire after vital details of the RAF's main base on the Falklands Islands were published on their website. The secret document, which has the exact GPS co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the MoD's website. The details could be used as 'an invasion guide' by Argentina, with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any Argentine bombers sent to attack the islands. The Falklands Islands are defended by a squadron of RAF Typhoon aircraft operating from Mount Pleasant aerodrome on West Falkland, supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area . The aerodrome also operates as a Search and Rescue location with Sea King helicopters, pictured . The airstrip, pictured, is home to four Europfighter Typhoon aircraft tasked with defending the islands . The Aerodrome Manual was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the MoD's website and could have been downloaded by Argentine intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands. A senior military source told The Express: 'This is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get. 'It's practically an invasion handbook.\u00a0Taking out the runway could cripple Britain's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute.' The MoD admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled. They denied the information was particularly sensitive. The blunder occurred as Argentina was described as a 'very live threat' by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. This comes as Argentina is preparing to lease 12 Sukhoi SU-24 long-range bombers from Russia. The Falklands Islands are defended by modern Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, supported by Rapier surface-to-air missiles and 1,200 troops. The Royal Navy also patrols the area and nuclear-powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region. And the MoD recently announced the \u00a3228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences. The jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from Argentina in the event of a new conflict . Argentina is considering leasing 12 Suhkoi SU-24 bombers, pictured, from Russia. The Cold War-era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb Mount Pleasant without the need to refuel . The MoD published the Aerodrome Manual on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone . The Cold War-era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the Falklands Islands and return to Argentina without the need to refuel. It also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air-to-air missiles. The jets, despite being designed in the 1960s, are also capable of supersonic travel. This comes as tensions between Britain and Argentina have increased over plans by UK firms to drill for oil in the South Atlantic. Argentina's minister for the Malivinas - the name it uses for the Falklands Islands - Daniel Filmus threatened to prosecute any British firms exploring for oil near the islands. He said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the Falklands Islands' continental shelf, which we reject, and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities. 'We are satisfied that the Islands have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies, and will continue to support them as they move forward. Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands.'",

A single father of four was crowned MasterChef champion last night, fulfilling a dream to become a chef that he has nurtured since he was eight. Simon Wood, 38, battled it out against Emma Spitzer and Tony Rodd as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours. The final followed seven weeks of tough challenges, including the 'chef's table', which involved cooking one of three courses on a menu set up by Italian chef Massimo Bottura. It brings to an end the eleventh series of the popular BBC weekly amateur cooking contest. Mr Wood, a data manager from Oldham in Greater Manchester, served a starter of octopus with chorizo and cannellini beans followed by a main of squab pigeon served two ways with blackberry sauce, watercress puree and carrots. He finished with a dessert of lemon posset topped with seven garnishes \u2013 citrus tutti-frutti, charred grapefruit and orange, a lime tuile, limoncello pistachio crumb, edible flowers, tarragon leaves and a lime air. After he presented the dishes to the judges, Torode said: 'Do you know why I love you? Because you take something quite ordinary and make it special.' Wallace said: 'Simon is brilliant, he's an incredible talent.' After being crowned the winner, Mr Wood said: 'I'm shaking inside, it's so surreal, I can't begin to describe how happy I am. It's life changing.' Finalist Mr Rodd, 33, is an architectural recruitment consultant from London, while Miss Spitzer is the managing director of a luxury travel business and mother to four daughters under nine. Finalists: Simon Wood, 38, right, battled it out against Emma Spitzer, left, and Tony Rodd, centre, as they were challenged to cook judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace a three-course meal in three hours . Mr Wood said: 'I have been cooking since I could reach the top of the oven, and I always cooked at weekends with my grandma. 'When I was eight I won a competition where the prize was to have your dream job for the day and mine was to be a chef. Thirty years later who would have thought I would have the MasterChef trophy in my hands.' Momentous: Kim Woodward is the first woman to be appointed head chef at the Savoy Grill . A former MasterChef semi-finalist has become the first woman to run the prestigious Savoy Grill kitchen in its 126-year history. Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at the famous venue, which has hosted lunches for the likes of prime ministers, musicians and captains of industry for decades. The 34-year-old follows in the footsteps of a string of ma\u00eetre chefs who have headed the kitchen since its opening in the Strand, London in 1889. Ms Woodward, who lives in Camden, said: \u2018It is an absolute honour for me to be the head chef here in one of London\u2019s most iconic restaurants. Obviously there is so much history here, and the people who come through the door come here for the classic dishes that the Grill is famous for.\u2019 At the five-star, art deco Grill, which is now part of the Gordon Ramsay stable, Woodward will head a team of about 35 chefs, of whom some 40 per cent are women. It marks her return to the venue \u2014 she was a sous chef between 2010 and 2012, before becoming head chef at the York & Albany gastropub in Camden. She reached the semi-final of the 2011 series of MasterChef: The Professionals.",

Council inspectors found a shocking state of hygiene at The Steer Inn in Wilberfoss, East Yorkshire - and owner David Crossfield later admitted 17 charges of breaching food safety regulations. Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date. Shocking:\u00a0Officers carried out inspections where they found food in the kitchen was mouldy (above) and unfit for human consumption - and food was being served to the public that had exceeded its use by date . In addition, raw meat was being prepared in direct contact with ready to eat salad items posing a serious risk of cross contamination, Beverley Magistrates\u2019 Court was told. Inspectors - who first visited in January 2014 - also found kitchen equipment was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair, and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning. Meanwhile food safety systems, monitoring checks and procedures were not in place - and food handlers were found to consistently demonstrate a lack of understanding of food safety issues. Crossfield, 52, of Elvington, North Yorkshire - whom magistrates branded \u2018foolish\u2019 - also admitted failing to comply with a hygiene improvement notice requiring food hygiene training for his staff. Mouldy food and dirty floor: Inspectors found kitchen equipment at The Steer Inn was in an unhygienic condition due to disrepair and there was a failure to carry out regular disinfection and cleaning . Crossfield said he was the sole director of The Steer Inn (Pocklington) Ltd and had admitted he had taken over the running of the premises with no knowledge of running a kitchen or a restaurant. He said he had been worked in pubs and bars \u2018with no problems before\u2019 and he had been \u2018naive\u2019 and had been led to believe the chef had the right qualifications relating to food hygiene. Crossfield told the court that The Steer Inn had ceased trading on New Year\u2019s Eve 2014 and that he was in the process of liquidating the company, which had no assets. Chair of the bench Graham McDonald told him: \u2018These were appalling offences.\u00a0People could have become seriously ill or even died as a result of salmonella. East Yorkshire restaurant:\u00a0The company was fined \u00a38,500, plus costs of \u00a31,392 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120. Its owner was individually fined \u00a32,750, as well as costs of \u00a31,392 and a \u00a3120 victim surcharge . \u2018Your naivety was dangerous and the fact you relied on your chef was extremely foolish.\u2019 The company was fined \u00a38,500, plus costs of \u00a31,392 and a victim surcharge of \u00a3120. Crossfield was individually fined \u00a32,750, as well as costs of \u00a31,392 and a \u00a3120 victim surcharge. Paul Abbott, manager for public protection at East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said: \u2018The council\u2019s food safety team had offered considerable advice to the food business operator of the premises in an attempt to produce safe food but despite being rated a zero under the food hygiene rating scheme, he had failed to make meaningful improvements.

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner.

Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim ... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week. Further details will be announced in due course,\" the palace said in a statement. Roberts' attorneys were not immediately available for comment. The federal court filing alleged that \"Doe 3\" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed earlier this year in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media, and Buckingham Palace included it in a statement. Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed a non-prosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should face stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in January, including the one described as Jane Doe 3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a \"sex slave\" and made \"her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people.\" Those big names allegedly included Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. According to the filing, \"Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\" The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case \"is all about money\" and \"completely made up.\" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said \"lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably.\" \"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,\" he said. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\" CNN's Greg Botelho, Steve Almasy, Javier de Diego, Josh Levs contributed to this report.",

As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a \u00a31million house in Islington, London . In reality she has been one of the country\u2019s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an \u2018urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur\u2019, bought a large terrace house in Islington for \u00a3440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than \u00a31million in value. Promise: David Cameron and the Conservatives plan to extend \u2018right to buy\u2019 from council houses to housing association properties if they win . Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend \u2018right to buy\u2019 legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to \u2018some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents\u2019. She added: \u2018We are independent organisations and charities \u2013 you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they\u2019re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. ' So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.\u2019 Miss Davison\u2019s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: \u2018The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many \u2013 I couldn\u2019t afford to buy my home now. \u2018We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.\u2019",

HIV specialists and network security experts at University College London (UCL) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads . They worked together to build a model for this 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off AIDS. Scroll down for video . Researchers creates a model 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say the spread was similar to a computer virus . HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. The teams noticed that the spread of HIV through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. Lead author Changwang Zhang, of UCL, said: 'HIV and Conficker have a lot in common. 'They both use hybrid spreading mechanisms, persist for a very long time and are incredibly difficult to eradicate. 'Our model enables us to explain these important properties and to predict the infection process.' Changwang's supervisor co-author Dr Shi Zhou said: 'Although the cybersecurity community organised an unprecedented collaboration to tackle Conficker, they still failed to eliminate Conficker from the Internet. 'HIV researchers face a similar problem. We hope that our new understanding of hybrid epidemics will help us to fight against Conficker and HIV.' Detailed sample data from 17 HIV patients from London were used to verify the model, showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for HIV progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment. HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. Co-senior author Professor Benny Chain, of UCL, said: 'The number of HIV cells in the bloodstream is always relatively low, and our model shows that HIV spread through the bloodstream alone would not be enough to cause AIDS. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. 'It is likely that when HIV gains a foothold somewhere with a high T-cell population, such as the gut, it uses a cell-to-cell transfer mechanism to efficiently spread directly between them. As such, if HIV has already spread to an area rich in T-cells by the time treatment begins, preventing its spread through the bloodstream will not stop AIDS. 'Our model suggests that completely blocking cell-to-cell transfer would prevent progression to AIDS, highlighting the need to develop new treatments.' Laboratory research, led by co-senior author Dr Clare Jolly, has previously shown that some drugs are better than others at stopping HIV from spreading directly between cells. However, it's not possible to directly measure cell-to-cell spread in patients because it takes place inside internal organs. Dr Jolly said: 'With this new model, we should be able to assess the effectiveness of drugs against different modes of HIV spread in real patients. 'This could prove invaluable when interpreting the results of drug trials to understand what works and why. Using computer models to understand processes that we cannot directly observe is common in the physical sciences and supports many fundamental theories. 'Our model provides strong evidence that cell-to-cell spread is an important part of HIV spread, and we hope to show this directly in future animal studies.'.",

The video has been the subject of heated online debates over the species of the animal, with some users claiming it is a mythical 'water monster' and others that it's a diseased Malaysian Bear . A similar video surfaced in January of an ailing sun bear in Borneo island in Malaysia, which had been beaten by local plantation workers and driven into the bush. It was reported this month that the animal was discovered at another nearby plantation, where it is being nursed back to health. David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia the caged animal 'looks like a bear cub which is suffering from some medical condition which has caused it to loose all of its fur.' While he was unable to confirm if it was the same bear from the Borneo clip, he said he suspects it is and that the footage originates from Borneo not China. A heavily-polluted field in\u00a0Shenzhen Reservoir, where the mystery beats was apparently captured, has fuelled accusations the animal may have been contaminated . Internet users have also claimed the animal in the clip is a Malaysian sun bear (pictured) which is suffering from\u00a0alopecia, a disease which causes baldness .",

Brisbane locals were left scratching their heads after the mysterious message 'I'm sorry' followed by a love heart and two crosses for kisses was splashed across the city's clear blue sky on Monday afternoon. The aerial apology hovered above the CBD at about 1pm, prompting several people to jump onto social media to question and voice their theories about who had done what. One desperate man has forked out nearly $4000 for a written message in the sky in a bid to seek forgiveness .

An ABC reporter also took to Twitter, considering the apology was trying to make up for something bad . But the man who requested it didn't appear to be frantically lovelorn, he said. 'No, he was calm, cool and collected,' Mr Vance told AAP. While you can't put a price on love, Mr Vance said the service usually charged $3990 for up to 10 letters or characters. Interestingly, it's not the first time Mr Vance has made a profit from someone screwing up. 'It's usually along the same lines - someone saying sorry and that's basically it,' he said.

They were then taken to hospital, where Malachi met his dad, Nom, and two older siblings, who were grateful for the officers' actions. 'I do want to thank them for stepping in and stealing my shine,' Nom joked with KABC. 'No. Thank you. I'm glad he's here. He's healthy. We're happy. Everything's good.'

MailSport looks at the reasons why Atletico Madrid\u2019s meeting with Real Madrid can also lay claim to be the greatest city derby in world football. Opposites attract . The clash of styles is always fascinating. Carlo Ancelotti must accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema and that leaves him little choice but to play a 4-3-3. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema must all be accommodated, leaving little choice but 4-3-3 . Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are meeting for the fifth and sixth time in European competition that brings them level with Inter and AC Milan in number of city duels. Chelsea and Arsenal have met twice, as have Barcelona and Espanyol and Rapid and Steaua Bucharest. It\u2019s a system that leaves Real Madrid short in midfield especially when you consider none of the first choice midfield trio are defensive players. This plays perfectly into Atletico\u2019s hands. Diego Simeone will flood the midfield on Tuesday night as he has done in recent meetings between the two sides and see if his 4-4-2 with Arda Turan, Mario Suarez, Gabi and Koke can\u2019t over-run Rodriguez, Luka Modric in midfield. Atletico\u2019s two banks of four are also very good at closing the space down for Bale, Ronaldo and Benzema. No wonder Ancelotti said on Monday that playing Simeone\u2019s team is always a problem. Midfielder Koke will be deployed to try and smother the Real Madrid midfield during their last eight tie . The coaches . Simeone never tires of his \u2018one game at a time mantra\u2019 Ancelotti was on Monday talking about the challenge being not to beat Atletico but to win the 11th European Cup \u2013 the complete opposite of one game at a time. This meeting has added spice because it's the chance for last season's beaten finalists to avenge their victors. Borusia Monchengladbach had the same opportunity against Liverpool in 1978 as did Juventus against Ajax in 1997 and Inter Milan against Bayern Munich in 2011. Simeone\u2019s burns more calories on the touchline than some of his players while Ancelotti\u2019s activity tends to get no more anaerobic than opening another packet of chewing gum. The Italian has won the lot in club football, Simeone is on his way to equaling that feat \u2013 he has already won the league and cup in Spain, and the European and Spanish Super Cups along with the Europa League. He almost got the European Cup last year but Ancelotti denied him. For as long as the pair stay in Spain their futures will be linked. Diego Simeone raises his players one game at a time and the games against Real Madrid are no difference . Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti and Atletico boss Simeone often have their careers compared . The Real stars against the team with no stars . When Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by Atletico Madrid in the league in February it wasn\u2019t the Atletico players who went out partying. Real\u2019s players are the footballing glitterati and Ronaldo\u2019s high-profile birthday bash was part of that. Atletico\u2019s players take great joy in beating their pin-up rivals. Mario Mandzukic, Diego Godin and Raul Garcia are happy to play it ugly if it gets results. Diego Godin and Mario Mandzukic are happy to play ugly to achieve winning results for their side . Goals and golazos . Koke\u2019s thunderbolt shots, the inspiration of Turan, a moment\u2019s magic from Antoine Griezmann \u2013 Atletico Madrid are about more than just graft. And with Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema, James Rodriguez and Isco all capable of moments of brilliance the derbies have thrown up their fair share of great goals. Ronaldo and Gareth Bale's moments of brilliance have thrown up their fair share of goals in the game . Atletico Madrid's Turkish midfielder Arda Turan has scored his fair share of wondergoals in his career . Well-matched . They used to hold a sarcastic banner up behind the goal at the Santiago Bernabeu for the Madrid derby. It was written like a classified ad and read: \u2018wanted \u2013 decent rival for city derby\u2019. Those days are long gone. Atletico Madrid ended a 14-year run of not beating Real when they won the Copa del Rey against them two years ago. Sergio Ramos celebrates a goal against his rivals in the Champions League final in Portugal . The game is a chance for Simeone to get his own back on Ancelotti for the defeat in what is to date their only meeting in European competition. Although some would say with four wins and two draws in the six games in other competitions between the two since then, he has already done that. And they haven\u2019t looked back since. At the start of the season they beat them in the Spanish Super Cup and knocked them out of the Copa del Rey both times over two legs. The one blip in the recent run came when it mattered most in last year\u2019s Champions League final and they will hope to put that right on Tuesday night. Most City derbies have one side up and the other down \u2013 right now Atletico as Spanish Champions and Real as European Champions are a match for each other in every sense. Bale celebrates when it counts most as he scores in the Champions League final in Portugal in 2014 .",

Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'",

Nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on May 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s. Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservatives, narrowly topped the polls assessing who 'won' the two-hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for Britain. Crucially, 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed Cameron as 'the most impressive' on the subject of the economy, which lies at the heart of each party's campaign. But pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be Cameron or the Labour Party's Ed Miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast. Scroll down for video . The build-up: Prime Minister David Cameron went head-to-head with six other party leaders in a TV debate on Thursday night in an unusual format for Britain. It comes six weeks ahead of the general election on May 7 . Neck-and-neck: Cameron was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out Miliband (right) Nicola Sturgeon, of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate, which also featured the environment-focused Green Party, led by Natalie Bennett, and Wales' Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party completed the line-up. Analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a 'killer line' that would set them apart from the other participants. 'There was clearly no knock-out blow,' said Peter Kellner of pollster YouGov. Jonny Tudor, 17, who asked one of the questions on the night, said afterwards: 'Some performed well in answer to certain questions, other performed well on different subjects, but there was no definitive winner.' A rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted Cameron to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets. Too close to call? Pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the Labour Party's Ed Miliband (left) or David Cameron (right) in the top job after votes are cast.

Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . Rare moment of drama: A woman stood up during the debate to heckle Cameron about homelessness . But in a result that will calm Conservative nerves, a Comres/ITV poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged Cameron was the most capable of leading Britain, compared to 28 per cent who named Miliband. The event was the first and only full TV debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters, many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy. It is the only time Cameron and Miliband will go head-to-head on issues of policy before votes are cast. In one of Cameron's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance, he pointed to his rivals, one-by-one, and said: 'What I'm hearing is more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes, some more debt and more taxes, and definitely more debt and more taxes.'

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nArsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if \u00a330million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer . Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November . Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal \u00a330m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 . Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career . But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over \u00a330m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year . He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September . The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season . Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season . Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters .",

But this is actually a mocked-up image of Britain\u2019s ideal dog, comprising different parts of several breeds to create the perfect furry friend. The coat of an English bulldog, the ears of a King Charles spaniel and the tail of an Irish setter help make up a set of ideal characteristics voted for by 2,000 pet owners. The perfect dog also has the body size of a border collie, the snout of a labrador and the eyes of a beagle. Scroll down for video . The dog has all the best bits from the UK's favourite breeds, the hair of an English Bulldog and a Labrador nose . The research found more than a third of owners wanted their dog to have a short, low-maintenance coat, while a similar proportion favoured soft, floppy ears. Almost half said their ideal dog would be \u2018standard-sized\u2019 like a collie, compared with 36 per cent who preferred smaller lap dogs such as chihuahuas. The \u2018soft and round\u2019 snout of a labrador was the most favourable nose, with 50 per cent of the vote, beating the elongated snout of a collie which was chosen by 24 per cent. When it came to naming their pets, 29 per cent of owners said they opted for \u2018human\u2019 choices such as Dave or Lucy.

But slightly more \u2013 33 per cent \u2013 preferred traditional dogs\u2019 names including Rover and Bailey. The survey, by flea treatment brand Frontline Spot On, also found that people favoured different types of dog depending on where they lived. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 41 per cent of Londoners preferred small dogs who don\u2019t take up much room. Meanwhile almost a fifth of owners in East Anglia, with its swathes of countryside, picked the large great dane as their favourite breed. Our 'perfect dog' has the body of a Border Collie (right) but the Great Dane was most popular in East Anglia . Voters in different areas preferred their dogs larger or smaller, depending on the region where they lived . Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) rather than a retriever-sized pooch (34 per cent). Meanwhile, those in East Anglia prefer Great Danes (19 per cent) over tiny dogs like Chihuahuas (4 per cent). A quarter of owners valued their pet\u2019s companionship so much they said the perfect dog would live for as long as they did \u2013 instead of the normal lifespan of around ten to 13 years. The survey also asked about the ideal dog\u2019s sound, with 30 per cent opting for the \u2018mid-range\u2019 bark of a labrador as opposed to a high-pitched yap. Brock Abreu, Frontline Spot On brand manager, said: \u2018When it comes to our ideal canine companion, looks really do matter. \u2018It is also great to see that we are being patriotic and championing those traditional and beautiful British dog breeds.\u2019 Those living in London are more likely to opt for a small and lap-sized dog (41 per cent) than a larger retreiver .",

The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either \u2018incredibly naive or totally incompetent\u2019 by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank\u2019s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for \u2018a further one-year period\u2019 before leaving the bank\u2019s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that \u2018no decision has been taken at this time\u2019. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: \u2018You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.\u2019 Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC\u2019s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax.

Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than \u00a3500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC\u2019s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC\u2019s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that \u2018frontline\u2019 staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank\u2019s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: \u2018We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.\u2019 But Mrs Hodge responded that to \u2018simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose\u2019. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role\u00a0over her HSBC role . Her likely departure from HSBC comes as the bank is planning for a wider clearout of non-executives who have been on the board for a long period of time.",

Ms McGregor recalled that very moment - during her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday - when the prime minister told her 'it was okay'. 'I actually said to him \"your party won't be thrilled about this\",' she said, the ABC reports.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) publicly backed McGregor (right) by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman . Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says. 'There is a kind of a firefighter buried inside the politician still and he tends to barge into burning buildings if his friends are in there.' Mr Abbott publicly backed his friend by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman. Ms McGregor, now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm. In 2012, after years of drowning agonising pain with alcohol and drugs, McGregor stopped 'functioning' as a man and chose to live as a woman.

But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.' The ABC did however report that she said: 'He's not a supporter of gay marriage, I'm sad about that.'",

Judge John Koeltl said in a decision made public Tuesday that the incendiary ad is speech protected under the First Amendment. He said he was sensitive to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's claim that the poster could incite violence and appreciates the efforts necessary to prevent violent attacks targeting Jewish people. AFDI 1, MTA 0: A federal judge has ordered the\u00a0Metropolitan Transportation Authority to run on its buses anti-Islam ads featuring the phrase 'Killing Jews is Worship' created by the pro-Israel lobby\u00a0American Freedom Defense Initiative . But he noted that substantially the same advertisement ran in San Francisco and Chicago in 2013 without incident. He added that examples of violent attacks cited by the MTA show that individuals may commit heinous acts without warning. Koeltl also noted that the MTA and Chairman Thomas Prendergast 'underestimate the tolerant quality of New Yorkers and overestimate the potential impact of these fleeting advertisements.' 'Under the First Amendment, the fear of such spontaneous attacks, without more, cannot override individuals' rights to freedom of expression,' Koeltl said in a ruling dated Monday. He delayed enforcing his order to run the ads by a month so it can be appealed. MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg said the agency is disappointed in the ruling and is preparing a response. It came in a lawsuit filed last year by the American Freedom Defense Initiative, an organization headed by firebrand blogger Pamela Geller that's behind the advertisement. David Yerushalmi, a lawyer for the organization, said the decision 'sends a strong message both to government bureaucrats who would restrict our freedom of speech based upon what they perceive to be a global jihadist threat, and it also sends a telling message to our enemies abroad and at home: Their threats of violence will not prevent the courts from upholding the First Amendment.' The lawsuit said Geller's group buys the advertisements to express its message on current events and public issues 'including issues such as Islam's hatred of Jews.' An ad from the pro-Israel American Freedom Defense Initiative is seen on an articulated Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) bus featuring a 1941 photograph of Hitler and supporter Hajj Amin al-Husseini, a Palestinian Arab nationalist, Wednesday, April 1, 2015, in Philadelphia . The lawsuit was filed after the MTA notified the group in August that it would display three of four proposed posters but not an ad with the quote 'Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah' because it could incite violence. In the ad, a man's menacing face wrapped with a checkered scarf is shown next to the quote, which is attributed to \"Hamas MTV.\" It is followed by the words: 'That's his Jihad. What's yours?' It also includes a disclaimer that the ad's display does not imply the MTA's endorsement of its views. The MTA, whose buses and subways have been forums for policy debates, has accepted other ads from the American Freedom Defense Initiative. In September 2012, subway stations in New York featured AFDI posters that read: 'In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.' Two years later, Pamela Geller's group agreed to pull an ad from the subway system showing captive journalist James Foley with the masked militant who decapitated him in the moment before the beheading. In a September statement, the MTA said it recognized that the 'Killing Jews' ad was a parody of 'MyJihad' ads sponsored by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which said it was promoting the concept that jihad is an individual and personal struggle rather than a violent conflict or terrorism. Koeltl said he recognized that the MTA believes it would be far more difficult to counter the advertisement because it has parodic aspects. Past ads:\u00a0A man stands next to ad in the New York Subway saying: 'In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad' in New York on September 24, 2012 . But he said he believes the agency underestimates 'the power of counter-advertisements to explain that the MTA does not endorse the ad and that the ad is not to be taken seriously.' Monica Klein, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, noted in a statement that the mayor has said 'these anti-Islamic ads are outrageous, inflammatory and wrong, and have no place in New York City, or anywhere.' 'These hateful messages serve only to divide and stigmatize when we should be coming together as one city,' she added. 'While those behind these ads only display their irresponsible intolerance, the rest of us who may be forced to view them can take comfort in the knowledge that we share a better, loftier and nobler view of humanity.' Firebrand: Right-wing blogger Pamela Geller is one of the founders of the controversial group behind the anti-Islam ads .",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that intercepted phone calls prove the US helped Chechen Islamic insurgents wage war against Russia. In a documentary aired today  on state-owned Rossiya-1 TV channel, he said phone records from the early 2000s show direct contact between North Caucasus separatists and US secret services. 'At one point our secret services simply detected direct contacts between militants from the North Caucasus and representatives of the United States secret services in Azerbaijan,' Putin said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question. But he claimed a few days later the heads of Russia's FSB received a letter from their American counterparts, which said they had the right to support opposition forces in Russia. 'Someone over there, especially the West's intelligence services, obviously thought that if they act to destabilize their main geopolitical rival, which, as we now understand, in their eyes has always been Russia, it would be good for them. It turned out, it wasn't,' Putin said. He said he had warned the West about the possible dangers of supporting terrorists. Following a disastrous war in the 1990s, Russia fought Islamic insurgents in Chechnya and neighboring regions in the volatile North Caucasus. 'They were actually helping them, even with transportation,' Putin said. The documentary 'The President' showed Putin being interviewed at the Kremlin in the dimly-lit St. Alexander's Hall. He even defended the annexation of Crimea as a response to the will of the people, saying it righted a historical injustice. The annexation of the Black Sea peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 provoked the worst crisis between the West and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Putin said he had no regrets. 'It's not because Crimea has a strategic importance in the Black Sea region. It's because this has elements of historical justice. I believe we did the right thing and I don't regret anything,' he said. Putin said he raised the issue with then-US President George W. Bush, who promised to 'kick the ass' of the intelligence officers in question . Putin also said sanctions imposed by the West after the annexation were aimed at halting Russia's progress as a global power. Putin condemned punitive sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union. 'We have witnessed such attempts during Russia's entire history, dating back to tsarist times. This attempt to deter Russia, this policy, has been known for a long time, for centuries. There is nothing new,' he was reported as saying. Putin also expressed his fears that the West wishes Russia harm as he recalled how some world leaders told him they would not mind Russia's possible disintegration. 'My counterparts, a lot of presidents and prime ministers told me later on that they had decided for themselves by then that Russia would cease to exist in its current form,' he said. 'The only question was when it happens and what consequences would be.'",

But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.",

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby,\u00a0when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video . Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level, \u00a0measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight . 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered. The mass, which has risen some 50ft above sea level, measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide .

New view: Local residents from Rausu, Hokkaido, take a look at the newly emerged coastline . Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline, but they do not expect it to expand further, said an official at the central government's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau. 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives.

Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.",

Two people quickly cross the track in front of the train as it begins picking up speed and passes alongside a ledge that looks down on chalets below. The video then shows the train beginning its descent of the mountain, passing very close to a number of skiers who make their own way to the bottom of the slope. The video opens inside a tunnel build into the Swiss mountain as the train makes its way along the 9km long electrified track . Turning right the train enters another tunnel and plunges back into darkness before re-emerging next to even more skiers.

But now, a young African-American man has released a video disputing claims that all white police officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color', insisting that 'there are good cops out there'. In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Will Stack, a 22-year-old U.S. Army National Guardsman, recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in the state's Lexington County. He explains how he was pulling out of Lexington County Courthouse on Wednesday, to make a left turn, when he decided to use the empty median lane to access the left turn lane, which was full. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're bad': Will Stack, 22, a U.S. Army National Guardsman, has released a video (pictured) disputing claims that all white officers treat suspects 'on the basis of their color' Moments later, he was stopped by the cop for 'improper use of the median'. 'He told me what I did, asked for my license and registration, I gave that to him,' Mr Stack says in the selfie-style video. He continues: 'Now, I will say that why he was here with me, I made sure my hands were on the steering wheel, I made sure to speak very politely as I always do. I did what he told me to do. 'I handed him the information and I sat here and waited and turned my music down.' The officer left Mr Stack's car for a few minutes, before walking back and returning the documents to him. He then explained the proper use of the median to Mr Stack, telling him it 'needs to be open for emergency vehicles'. 'I was in the wrong, I didn't realize it. I did it out of habit,' Mr Stack admits. After acknowledging the officer's words, Mr Stack, a former Psychology student at the University of South Carolina, was given a warning and both him and the cop went their respective ways. In the video,  filmed minutes after the encounter and later posted on Mr Stack's Facebook\u00a0page, where it has been viewed 1.7million times, Mr Stack goes on to explain why he is telling his story. Traffic stop: In the footage, which has gone viral on social media, Mr Stack recounts his own experience with a 'Caucasian officer' in South Carolina. He says he was given a warning after doing everything the cop said . Praise: Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented (above) on Mr Stack's selfie-style video, with many praising him for his honesty amid a national scandal over alleged police brutality . Mixed opinion: Although many of the users' comments were positive, others were negative (as seen bottom) 'The point of this is to say that I am an African-American male, this gentleman was Caucasian. There were no problems. He did his job, I did what I was supposed to do, and that was it,' he says. 'I feel like people need to understand that not all officers are crooked, not all officers are racist, bad people, and not all people who get shot or Tasered or arrested by officers are innocent victims. 'Just because you're black doesn't mean you're a victim, just because you're white doesn't mean you're a racist, just because you're a cop doesn't mean you're a bad person.' He adds: 'This world really needs to stop putting labels on people and things and see them as who they are: people doing things. Ignorance has no color. God doesn't see color. Why should we?' Mr Stack captured the video just days after North Charleston officer Michael Slager was arrested for murder for allegedly shooting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away.

He told WIS that although he had concerns over the use of force  applied by Officer Slager, 33, he was keeping an open mind about the shooting - and did not believe Scott should have tried to flee. Speaking to the station, Mr Stack, who recently completed a deployment with the National Guard and is now job hunting, said: ' It's possible for African Americans and police officers to get along. 'And, not everybody shares the same mindset because nobody's the same, everybody's different.' Over the past few days, thousands of Facebook users have commented on Mr Stack's video, with many praising him for his honesty amid the national scandal over alleged police\u00a0brutality.

Police in Ragusa, a Sicilian port town, arrested three Syrian men who were at the helm of the Turkish-flagged yacht attempting to reach the Italian coast. It is thought the smugglers had charged each person $8,500 (\u00a35,700) to make the crossing, with police saying the total earned by the organisers was somewhere in the region of \u00a3536,000. Scroll down for video . The luxury yacht, which was flying a Turkish flag, was stopped as it approached Europe with a 'cargo' which is thought to have been worth $800,000 - or \u00a3536,000 - to the organisers . This is far more than the usual cost of\u00a0between 1,000 and 1,500 euros - \u00a3720 to \u00a31,080 - to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. However, the boat was far more seaworthy than some of the other vessels used, which can be anything from\u00a0wooden fishing vessels to old cargo ships. Yet even the yacht failed to make the journey in its entirety: the attempt was discovered when two merchant ships were called out to aid a boat in distress. Selfies and other photos snapped by the Syrian and Palestinian passengers helped police identify the smugglers, police said in a statement. Police also revealed there were 23 children on bard the yacht. Harroum Almotassem Billah,\u00a0Haj Slima Moustafa and\u00a0Sabaj Ahmmed were all arrested for allegedly being part of the crew. Harroum Almotassem Billah, one of the three Syrians that were taken in custody by police for allegedly being part of the crew which was at the helm of the yacht . Haj Slima Moustafa was also taken into custody after the yacht - filled with Syrian and Palestinian migrants who paid $8,500 each for the journey - called for help as it approached the coast . Sabaj Ahmmed was the third member of the alleged crew attempting to bring the migrants, including 23 children, to Europe . The boat is the latest vessel to be stopped making the dangerous crossing from north Africa to Europe, packed with migrants desperate to start a new life. But many of the trips end in tragedy: so far this year, 1,776 have died, according to the U.N. refugee agency, which estimates that 219,000 people made the crossing in 2014. On Sunday alone, 900 men, women and children are believed to have died after their boat got into difficulty and overturned off Libyan waters, south of the southern Italian island of Lampedusa. There were only 28 survivors. These infrared images show the rescue operation after migrant ship capsized on Sunday . Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . Doctor Giuseppe Pomilla, of the Order of Malta, described the three hours he searched for the living among hundreds of dead floating corpses. He told the MailOnline: 'It was like a nightmare. It was a cemetery. There were bodies everywhere you looked.'",

Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette\u00a0reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair.

Police exhumed the boy's body from his grave in Norfolk last year after the case came up for periodical review. A DNA sample eventually led them to his mother. The woman, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained how the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends. She explained how she had placed her dead baby in the pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter on June 5, 1988, just a few days before it was found by teenagers on a Sunday afternoon outing. Scroll down for video . Unsolved case: A police officer searches Windmill Pit, the Norfolk pond where the baby boy's body was found back in 1988 . The boy's body was exhumed by officers as part of a case review, with DNA samples leading police to the boy's mother. He has now been reburied at Weasenham St Peter church, Norfolk . Police said they have ruled out any foul play and the woman remains on bail while the CPS decide whether to charge her with failing to register a birth and preventing a lawful burial. During the original investigation, police had been unable to identify the mother and villagers carried out a collection to raise money to pay for the baby's burial at 13th century St Peter's Church in the village. A report in the Eastern Daily Press from 1988 tells how the body was found floating on the pond . But after the body was exhumed in April last year, DNA taken from his leg bone was put through the national police database which found a match for a possible relative of one of the parents. Detectives examined that person's family tree and identified the woman who admitted being the boy's mother. A police spokesman said: 'In this case it was not clear how the baby died despite a post mortem examination and the circumstances surrounding the death remained the focus of the investigation. 'Thanks to advances in DNA we were able to trace the mother of the baby and during interview the woman revealed she had concealed her pregnancy from family and friends and delivered the baby by herself. 'Sadly the baby was delivered stillborn and we are satisfied there was no third party involvement or foul play.' Det Insp Andy Guy, of Norfolk Police who led the investigation said the DNA was compared to five million samples on the national database. He said: 'It came back with a match of a family member and by looking at that family we were able to find a lady of the right age. 'We went to see that individual and she told us she was mum. She was arrested on suspicion of infanticide. 'We were then given an account by the lady concerned who gave details about the birth and details only the mother would know to myself and the officer who interviewed her. 'The pregnancy was concealed from everybody. She didn't tell her family, her close friends, she gave birth in secret. The baby was stillborn.' The woman told officers how she placed her dead baby in the pond, known locally as Windmill Pit, before it was found by a group of teenagers. The boy was originally buried without a name but \u00a0a support group for parents of stillborn children raised the money for a new headstone giving his name as Peter after the name of the church . A second post-mortem carried out on the remains last year found no evidence of foul play. An inquest held in 1988 body also failed to establish a cause of death. The baby boy was re-buried in the churchyard on June 5 last year - the 26th anniversary of his discovery - he was named Peter after the name of the church. Det Insp Guy said police were now satisfied that nobody else had been involved at the time. He added: 'This has been unsolved for 27 years. By using the latest techniques, we've solved something which has been a mystery for a long time.' 'We don't ever give up. All the unsolved cases we have going back to the 60s are still on our books and they're reviewed at regular intervals.' Det Insp Guy said the small team of officers involved in the case had 'mixed feelings' after bringing the investigation to a final close. He said: 'From a police officer's perspective, it's fantastic. From a human perspective you can only have empathy for the woman and imagine how terrible it was for her.' The grave of the baby was originally marked by a simple wooden cross, which read: 'In loving memory of unknown baby boy. Born and died 1988.' A support group called Hana's Gift for families who have suffered a stillbirth has now paid for a new headstone giving his name as Peter. The inscription reads: 'In loving memory of baby Peter, June 1988. A sweet little child, lost but then found, to bloom and grow in Heaven's playground. There is no foot so small that it cannot leave an imprint on the world.' Tranquil: The pond in the village of Weasenham St Peter, Norfolk, as it is today . Karen Murray-Tye who set up Hana's gift charity after her daughter was stillborn in 2006, said: 'It was quite hard to find the right words, but I thought the 'lost but found' fitted the circumstances. 'I hope she sees we've tried to do the best for him as we have for Hana. It would be lovely if it made her think she could have some support if she came forward.' Norfolk coroner's chaplain Chris Copsey said: 'When the coffin was exhumed all that was left was a little plaque that said 'unnamed baby boy'. 'It seemed terrible to bury an unnamed baby boy so I took the name of the church, St Peter's church.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex \u2013 they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk \u2013 a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent \u2013 by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report \u2013 based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people \u2013 found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality \u2013 women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'",

But at the same time he claimed that overall caps on net migration \u2013 as pledged by the Tories \u2013 would be \u2018ludicrous\u2019 because it was impossible to stop people leaving the country. Ukip\u2019s manifesto chief later added to the confusion by saying the 50,000 limit \u2018might change every year\u2019. Confusion over Ukip\u2019s immigration policy grew yesterday after Nigel Farage called for the number of arrivals into Britain to be limited at 50,000 a year . The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration. Ukip first unveiled an immigration cap in February, with spokesman Stephen Woolfe saying the numbers being granted visas limited at 50,000. But at the start of March, Mr Farage overturned this by saying he would not set \u2018arbitrary targets\u2019. At the end of the month, the Ukip leader spoke of a net migration limit of \u2018about 30,000 people a year\u2019. Charlie Elphicke, the Tory candidate in Dover, said: \u2018Ukip\u2019s immigration policy doesn\u2019t just change by the day, it changes by the minute in the space of one interview. It\u2019s complete chaos. \u2018The truth is with Nigel Farage, you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. The only certainty is that a vote for Ukip lets Ed Miliband limp into Downing Street via the backdoor - and then there will be no action on immigration.\u2019 Interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme yesterday, Mr Farage said about his party\u2019s cap: \u2018It\u2019s below 50,000 a year, all right? It\u2019s below 50,000 a year. Simple as that. The Conservatives accused Mr Farage of \u2018making up his policies as he goes along\u2019 \u2013 but Mr Farage has denied his party has made any U-turns on immigration . \u2018But this whole debate we\u2019ve been tied up with caps for five years. It\u2019s devalued the debate. What we\u2019re not actually addressing is the fact that 624,000 people settled in Britain last year and that we have no control over the numbers that settle this year or next year. \u2018Let\u2019s be honest, we cannot have any debate about immigration about numbers while we\u2019re members of the European Union.\u2019 Later in the day, Suzanne Evans, Ukip\u2019s manifesto chief, said the level of the cap might change. She told the BBC News channel: \u2018If we say, we have 21,000 highly skilled people coming from outside of the EU, where there is already a points based system, then we will talk to the businesses, that\u2019s where we get our 50,000 limit from, but that might change every year.\u2019",

In  ISIS's most recent video, a young doctor, identified as Tareq Kamleh, called on foreign medics to travel to the ISIS stronghold in Raqqa to help launch the ISHS (the Islamic State Health Service). The video of Kamleh, who refers to himself as Abu Yusuf, showed him handling babies in a maternity ward while wearing western-style blue surgical scrubs and a stethoscope. Scroll down for video . The blue-eyed Australian doctor who features in the latest IS propaganda video has been identified as\u00a0Tareq Kamleh . Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh introduces the launch of the Islamic State Health Service . Once the propaganda video went viral, people from Kamleh's past started to recognise the previously unidentified doctor. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University. Upon completing his degree he reportedly worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. Kamleh then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, the Age reported. He completed his final stint in the Australian medical system working in Perth until late 2014. It was revealed Kamleh, who is believed to be in his late 20's, completed his medical degree at Adelaide University . 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests' A university student who knew Kamleh, but did not want to be named, said he showed no signs that he would defect to the radical militant group. 'He was a pretty normal guy, he didn't have any IS related interests,' she told\u00a0news.com.au. She said the 'clean cut' doctor was well known in her social circle as a 'womaniser' who didn't shy away from drinking alcohol. Kamleh was also recognised by Dr Stephen Napoli, co-owner of the Mannum Medical Centre in South Australia. He told the Age\u00a0the 'intelligent' doctor had interned with him for 10 weeks back in 2010. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge,' Dr Napoli said. 'As a doctor he worked quite well; he was quite intelligent, he presented to our practice as quite a sound doctor with good medical knowledge' Kamleh was known to practice medicine in Adelaide, Mackay and finally in Perth before he took up working for IS . Dr Napoli agreed that Kamleh had shown no signs of holding extreme Islamic views. 'There was no indication I'd be worried about his other associations when he was with us. 'There was nothing that I saw of his work as a medical practical that would suggest he would have any of these sorts of views.' The video's poster shows a cropped image of a doctor, wearing an western-style blue surgical scrubs which appear to mimic\u00a0Britain's National Health Service . A former college from Adelaide Hospital also came forward reporting that he recognised Kamleh in the footage immediately. 'I was taken aback as much because I certain certainly wouldn't have associated him with an association like IS. His principle seemed to be sound and focused on the care of his patients,' he told the Age. The collegue, who also chose not to be identified, said Kamleh's behaviours were not consistent with the Islamic State's conservative views on drinking or dating. 'I know he dated a few nurses and other doctors over the years\u2026 he was heterosexual and certainly interested in the ladies, with some success.' Yusuf  is shown monitoring and handling babies in a maternity unit as well as teaching another doctor how to care for the infant patients . The video featuring Kamleh, which is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group, shows the doctor interviewed inside the paediatric ward of a Syrian hospital. 'My name is Abu Yusuf. I made hijrah from Australia to the Islamic State to live under the khilafah,' he says. 'I saw this as part of my jihad for Islam, to help the Muslim Ummah (community) in the area that I could which is the medical field.' He claims to be sad he delayed travelling to Syria for so long. 'It is disappointing to think how many fellow Muslims brothers and sisters in the medical field, who are doctors and nurses, physios, who are still living in the West and unfortunately the Muslims living here are suffering, not necessary from a lack of equipment or medicine but a mainly a lack of qualified medical care.' The vision is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Yusuf urges foreign Muslims with medical training to come forward and join the latest caliphate initiative. 'We really need your help. It is not the equipment that we are lacking, it is truly just the staff. Inshallah see you soon.' Australian National University terrorism expert Dr Clarke Jones confirmed the authenticity of the video to Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm familiar with IS propaganda and this is certainly legit,' he said. Abu Yusuf al-Australi calls upon foreigners with medical training to join the Islamic State's new medical initiative . 'The video is interesting because it's trying to communicate a sense of normalcy within the caliphate. The babies, ambulances and modern medical equipment are a far cry from the barbarity of their other videos.' 'In reality, the conditions are not accurate: Syria remains a very hostile environment. But it communicates a major shift in their recruitment.' Dr Jones believes the group are trying to attract more sophisticated demographic than in the past, when they targeted disillusioned youths. 'They are asking for foreigners with medical training and an education, and they aren't trying to lure them for militant purposes. This poses an interesting question: is this still considered radicalisation?' Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas.

'In the Premier League it's very difficult to predict.' Arsene Wenger admits he could not have predicted Arsenal's impressive run of results . Aaron Ramsey's goal against Burnley extended the Gunners' record to 16 wins in their last 18 games .

However, with an FA Cup semi-final this weekend and still the chance to chase down Chelsea in the table, Wenger's position at Arsenal is again looking secure. Arsenal have won 16 of 18 games in all competitions and Wenger believes the change in fortune is down to him finally having a relatively injury-free squad. 'It's down to the quality and the attitude of the team, the quality of the spirit we have in the side,' he said.

They are the heart of the home, the hub of dinner parties and usually the \u2018debrief of the day\u2019 meeting room. So what makes a great kitchen? It\u2019s a balance between a warm and inviting design combined with practical efficiency. After judging the kitchens on The Block last week and taking into account what buyers look for in a kitchen, property buyers expert Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design. Activity based design: . The key to ensuring the practicality of your kitchen is to zone areas of the kitchen based on activities e.g. food preparation, cooking, clean-up etc. with storage for those activities within those zones. These areas need to be easily accessible to each other and flow well (e.g. food preparation near the cooking area etc.). There\u2019s no use in a pretty kitchen when your preparation area is on the opposite end of the kitchen from your stovetop. Bench space: . This is one of the most common bugbears when buyers are looking at kitchens. Enough bench/counter space is crucial not only for food preparation but also for serving when entertaining. Scroll down for video . There was plenty of bench space in Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen on The Block . Storage space: . Plenty of storage space is essential and you need to find a good balance between design aesthetics and practicality. Take into account what\u2019s most important for you in terms of storage, as I recommended a Walk-in pantry vs a Butler\u2019s pantry, consider whether having extra space for preparation and a large area to hide your appliances is paramount to you or whether a larger area for food storage is more vital. Judge Neale Whitaker said\u00a0Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual\u00a0the flare, confidence or pizzazz' Sufficient lighting: . As the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Jury discussed when viewing Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen, it\u2019s not an area of the home that you can get away with the \u2018bare bones\u2019 when it comes to lighting. For the purpose of safety in food preparation and cooking, good lighting is paramount. Specifically in the preparation, cooking and cleaning areas, it\u2019s essential to have good quality lighting. Josh and Charlotte\u2019s kitchen lacked lighting above the benchtop according to\u00a0Frank Valentic . Splash backs: . In the cooking and cleaning zones of the kitchen, splashbacks are important and while design is also important, it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of practicality. Try and find a good medium between something that looks great but is also low maintenance and easy to clean! The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background . Ventilation: . Akin to the bathroom, the kitchen requires great ventilation so ensure you have a good quality range hood and windows that can be opened. Valentic says there was 'great ventilation' in Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchen . Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges . Flow on: . The overall design of your home really needs to come into play when designing a kitchen. The flow between the living areas, specifically dining areas and the kitchen are important. As we mentioned when judging Jess and Ayden\u2019s and Tim and Anastasia\u2019s kitchens, a kitchen with a flow on to an outdoor entertaining area is very much in demand at the moment and a huge plus for buyers. Jess and Ayden\u2019s kitchen had a 'great flow' on from the living and dining areas . Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win and add $10,000 to their kitty . Valentic's example of a kitchen at 12 Kyarra Street in Hampton that would attract buyers' attention . Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design . In the end, Dea and Darren\u2019s kitchen for the Buyer\u2019s Advocate Judges showed the best balance between design and a practical layout. While a kitchen is a very personal area of the home, make sure to take into account re-sale when renovating so that it doesn\u2019t affect the value of your property when you re-sell it. However,\u00a0if The Block: Triple Threat judges were the buyers this week, they would have walked away from each of the team's apartments without placing an offer. Judging trio Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer were all left largely unimpressed by the kitchens delivered by the Blockheads on last Sunday night's episode. The lacklustre performance, in the eye of the judges, meant that Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win of the series and add $10,000 to their kitty. The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background. Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges. Meanwhile, Whitaker said Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual the flare, confidence or pizzazz'. The living area, dining room, and kitchen flow onto the outdoor entertaining space .",

His sleepless nights must be becoming all the more frequent as these haunting weeks go by. Down rained the boos yet again from a disgruntled bunch of supporters who deserve so much more than this; far more than a team lacking identity and direction. Those fans will quite rightly point to the fact their side were out-played for large parts against Rotherham, a club with a far inferior budget and experience at this level. They are losing faith in their manager, even though Fulham should retain their Championship status from here. Ross McCormack (left) pokes home the equaliser but Fulham were unable to push on for the winner . That they came away with a point was down to poor finishing from the Yorkshire visitors, nothing more. Ross McCormack came to the rescue after Matt Derbyshire\u2019s early opener to spare blushes. Fulham just want this wretched campaign over. \u2018First half we were awful,\u2019 Symons said. \u2018Second half was a huge improvement to a bit better than awful. We\u2019re limping closer. \u2018The sooner we get the points needed the sooner I\u2019ll start sleeping in an evening.\u2019 That spoke volumes. Kit Symons (centre) admitted his side were second best and says the club need to rebuild in the summer . \u2018It is slow and it\u2019s painful. We need to rebuild in the summer. It\u2019s an anxious period - people are concerned. The players did show good character to come from behind.\u2019 Steve Evans\u2019 team still await their fate after being charged for fielding an ineligible player, Farrend Rawson, during the win against Brighton earlier this month. Should the Football League follow the precedent set with AFC Wimbledon last year, the Millers will find themselves lumped with a three-point deduction. When that judgement is to be made remains unclear - although it almost certainly will come before the final day on May 2 - meaning the relegation dogfight could go to the wire, with resurgent Millwall enjoying a game in hand. Rotherham knew points must be won here, and set about bossing proceedings from the very first minute. Matt Derbyshire (centre) pokes home the opener after four minutes to put Steve Evans' side in the lead . Fulham XI:\u00a0Bettinelli, Richards, Turner, Burn, Husband, Parker, Guthrie, Tunnicliffe (Hoogland - 54), Ruiz, McCormack, Smith . Subs not used:\u00a0Kiraly, Stafylidis, Hutchinson, Woodrow, Rodallega, Kavanagh . Goals: McCormack 67 . Booked: Guthrie, Burn, Turner . Rotherham XI: Martinez, Hunt, Morgan, Broadfoot, Lafferty; Smallwood, Arnason, Frecklington, Pringle; Ward, Derbyshire . Subs not used:\u00a0Collin, Wilson, Wood, Hammill, Bowery, Milsom, Green . Goals: Derbyshire 4 . Booked: Broadfoot . Referee: Andy Davies . How it came to pass that Matt Derbyshire might\u2019ve put the visitors three goals up inside the first four minutes will mystify Symons. Eventually the former Olympiacos striker settled for one, the simplicity galling for a club who were facing Tottenham this time a year ago. Firstly Derbyshire clipped wide inside the six-yard box before the long legs of Dan Burn prevented him from tapping home seconds later. But Fulham fell asleep from Ben Pringle\u2019s corner to present Derbyshire with a third opportunity and he wasn\u2019t to miss, stabbing in from close range to signal the Craven Cottage dissenters to find their voice. Matt Smith\u2019s header was cleared off the line in an instant reply, but Symons\u2019 side looked shot, as they had been here against Brentford and Wigan previously. And they allowed Derbyshire in again, this time Burn misreading a high ball, but he was thwarted by Marcus Bettinelli. Danny Ward squandered a glorious chance from 12 yards, skewing a shot wide as Fulham continued to be carved open. Bryan Ruiz (10) is denied a goal by the on-rush Arsenal loanee\u00a0Emiliano Martinez of Rotherham . Fulham's remaining  fixtures:\u00a0Blackpool\u00a0(A), Middlesbrough\u00a0(H),Norwich (A) Rotherham's remaining fixtures: Norwich (H), Reading (H), Leeds (A) Kirk Broadfoot was guilty of missing a superb chance from another corner and the central defender later struck a post. Saying they could have scored five before the break isn\u2019t hyperbolic. 'They could've been out of sight,' admitted Symons. Bryan Ruiz spurned a good opportunity for the hosts, McCormack then failing to stretch far enough to covert at the back post. Every stray pass was met with groans, each overhit cross with sighs. Many are resigned to these turgid displays, but more than a small section just will not accept it. Symons was bailed out by McCormack though, who got on the end of Scott Parker\u2019s pass to poke in a 67th-minute equaliser. It was a rare moment of quality, but edges them closer to safety. Matt Smith (centre) was unable to continue his good goalscoring form for the Cottagers . \u2018The goal is a blatant handball by McCormack,\u2019 Rotherham assistant Paul Raynor fumed. \u2018We dominated possession and created a number of opportunities.\u2019 \u2018You hope something\u2019s going to fall for us. One thing that can never be labelled against our team is a lot of character and desire. That\u2019s the minimum we expect. We\u2019re enjoying the challenge and had a difficult week. A good word to use is defiance.\u2019 Symons added: \u2018I\u2019ve seen the goal again and there\u2019s probably an element of doubt, but I\u2019d expect them to have a moan about it.\u2019 The goal gave the whole place a lift, Smith unfortunate not to win a penalty after Craig Morgan\u2019s shove and substitute Tim Hoogland thumped a header over when unmarked at the back post. Oddly, one point may have been three but that would\u2019ve merely masked glaring deficiencies. For all the talk of difficulties, staying in the division is the only thing that matters. Time for Fulham to press reset and start again.",

Garlanded: Wreaths such as those around the calf's neck are traditionally used in India during worship . Baby teeth: One of Nandi's mouths is clearly bigger than the others, which hang around his face . Two years ago, an American farm revealed it had a calf with two heads\u00a0but only one brain. Vets said the little heifer, in Whiting, Vermont, was meant to be a twin but the egg did not separate properly in the womb. Each head mimicked the other, meaning when she was feeding with one of her mouths, her other mouth was sucking too. Two-faced: This 440kg bull, which has faces on top of each other, was sold to an abattoir last month . Double-headed: The female calf born that was born in Whiting, Vermont, two years ago .

During a lesson on tolerance and acceptance, children at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point were read I Am Jazz, a book about\u00a0a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender. Some parents are unhappy with the school after they say their children came home with questions about gender and wondering if they too might be trans. I Am Jazz is a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender . One unnamed mom was so angry she contacted conservative pundit Sean Hannity after she felt that the school ignored her initial complaint. 'I feel like my thoughts, feelings and beliefs were completely ignored\u2026.My right as a parent to allow or not allow this discussion with my child was taken from me. It is very upsetting to me that I didn't have an option at all,' she told\u00a0Hannity.com. 'When I spoke with the principal he was very cold about it. It's amazing how thoughtless the school has been with this whole thing.' The mother claims that lesson prompted her 7-year-old son to start asking a lot of questions and questioning if he might be trans - something that he had never previously spoken about. 'I was taken aback by it\u2026 Being seven, once you put something in their mind they don't forget so easily,' she said. In the wake of Hannity contacting the school asking for clarity, officals have now apologized. Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, said she supported the reading of the book but admitted that parents should have been first notified. Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues . Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, admitted that parents should have been first notified . 'We have a practice of if a topic is considered sensitive, parents should be informed. In this situation, that didn't happen,' she said. 'The whole culture at Mitchell School is about teaching tolerance and respect. The people presenting the lesson thought [I Am Jazz] was one more piece of teaching that lesson. In retrospect, we understand that toleration is tolerating people of all opinions.' But at least one parents has come out in support of the school's initial decision to select the book as appropiate for teaching young students. 'People in this country, parents in this country are outraged by bullying, teen suicide rates and the depression in children. The staff of Mitchell School is doing something about this. By teaching acceptance and love they are shedding a light on [LGBTI] issues,' reports Gay Star News. 'LGBTQ issues should never be classified as a \"sensitive subject\" \u2014 there is nothing sensitive about the way we are born. Blonde hair, brown hair, gay, straight or somewhere in-between, we are all people and we all need acceptance.' The book at the center of the controversy, I Am Jazz, is based off of the life of now 14-year-old Jazz Jennings who, although born a boy, claims to have identified as a girl since he was two-years-old. 'From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing,' reads the book's description on Amazon.com. 'This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers.'",

Owners admit they spend hours watching the box with their animals and even leave it on when they are out to keep them company. And the nation's cats, dogs and pigs show a marked preference for programmes featuring other animals while shunning reality shows such as the Keeping Up With The Kardashians and TOWIE. Paul O'Grady's show 'For the Love of Dogs' is an absolute television favourite of pets . Almost two thirds of goldfish owners, 63 per cent, even confess to putting the tank in sight of the TV so their fish can watch it for more than three and a half hours a day. The survey of 1,000 pet owners even found the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch four hours of shows per day - or 28 hours a week. The new study by Virgin Media reveals how much our household pets love sitting in front of the box and watching their favourite TV programmes. Over a third of us, 34 per cent, say their pets watch three hours a day while left home alone - the equivalent of 42 episodes of EastEnders in a week. A quarter, 24 per cent, say their pets love watching TV so much they spend an incredible nine hours glued to it every day. Two-thirds of goldfish owners owned up to putting the bowl in sight of the TV and even the owner of a micro pig lets their pet watch 28 hours of TV a week . A survey has revealed that on average, pets watch 21 hours of TV of week, whether its with their owners or by themselves . A square-eyed one per cent of dogs are glued to the TV for over 10 hours. Owners heading off to work or spending the day out feel guilty for leaving their pet alone, as 29 per cent admit they turn on the TV as they believe their animal may get lonely without them.

According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege. A 24-year-old supermarket employee, Malian-born Lassana Bathily, was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from Coulibaly in the cold room. The hostage-taking was the culmination of three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The two brothers blamed for that attack, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed on January 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site. The terror attacks claimed the lives of 17 people and put France on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Ariana Williams reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points . King is joined by David Nugent to celebrate his goal, the 50th he has scored for his club . Leicester remain at the foot of the Barclay\u2019s Premier League table, a spot they have occupied since November, and four points from safety. But King, 26, thinks the momentum they are taking into the final eight matches of the season could be enough to propel them above the drop zone. \u2018I\u2019ve scored some pretty crucial goals before, but we might look back at the end of the season and that might turn out to be the most important one yet,\u2019 said King, . \u2018It\u2019s always nice to score for the only club you\u2019ve ever played for. I\u2019ve had a brilliant journey with this club. 'I\u2019ve been on 49 for a long time, and I\u2019ve been in the Premier League for a good few months now - I was hoping it would\u2019ve come earlier but I\u2019ve ticked that milestone off now and I\u2019m delighted about that. Nigel Pearson admits Leicester survival is still a 'big ask' despite win over West Ham . Pearson congratulates goalscorer Cambiasso after the final whistle of his side's win against the Hammers . \u2018But most importantly it was about getting the three points and we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of the season to make sure we\u2019re a Premier League team next season. \u2018We\u2019ve played well enough to prove we can survive and we\u2019ve not turned it into results - this is a results business. That proves to everyone - not just ourselves - that we mean business.\u2019 Leicester manager Nigel Pearson praised King, who he brought off the bench with 12 minutes to play and said his team were finally getting the results they deserved after several games this season where they have drawn or lost despite dominating. \u2018I would love to be a lucky manager who plays crap and wins but we have not been that,\u2019 he said. King says his goal against West Ham may turn out to be his most important for the club if they stay up . \u2018It would be a pretty grumpy man who wouldn't let them enjoy winning but we have to keep our destiny in our own hands.\u2019 His opposite number Sam Allardyce denied West Ham were \u2018drifting\u2019 towards the end of the season having won just twice in the last 14 games. \u2018We\u2019re not drifting but where we\u2019re failing is we\u2019re not as clinical as we used to be. Lads in their first season have found out what physical and mental attributes are needed for a long premier league season.\u2019",

'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment. 'Luckily he wore a thick long sleeve shirt or there would have been blood. He will have a few bruises in the morning. 'The passengers cheered when they heard she wasn't coming back on.' Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman accepts it will be difficult to keep hold of Nathaniel Clyne this summer as Manchester United prepare a bid for England's first-choice right back. An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season. Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton . Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League. Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay. 'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said. 'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong. 'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest. 'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club. Clyne made his full England debut last November . 'We need understanding for that but nothing else. 'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. We know our level, we know our possibilities. 'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.' Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign. 'We don't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something,' he said. 'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on. 'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.' Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull. Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez. It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City. There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week. 'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them. 'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club. Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool . Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence . 'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.' Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future. Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned. But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager. 'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'",

Robert O'Neill, who claims the distinction of personally shooting dead the Al Qaeda leader, will treat specially-invited guests to a weekend shooting retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Potential attendees were contacted by the right-leaning For America non-profit and told to write back by May 10 for a chance to open fire alongside O'Neill. Shoot with The Shooter: Supporters of a conservative nonprofit were offered the change of a luxury stay in Wyoming with Robert O'Neill, pictured while still in the Navy, which would include a 'machine gun fun' contest . Citing 'security reasons', the invitation, acquired by the Washington Post, did not say exactly when the event would be - but was clear about the hefty price tag. For their substantial donation, guests will be put up in the Amangani Resort Hotel, a sprawling luxury complex perched in the Rocky Mountains, on the edge of the Grand Teton National Park. Also included is the Jackson Hole Shooting Experience, which will see clay pigeon shooting, pistol events as well as the 'machine gun fun' session. The shooting will take the form of a competition, in which guests will try to beat O'Neill's score.

He has described his shooting prowess in great detail previously, specifically how he hit terrorist leader Bin Laden three times in the head, ending his life. Describing the top-secret 2011 raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, O'Neill wrote: 'He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].' In the account for Esquire magazine - written while he was still anonymous - O'Neill continued: 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap!' 'The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out.

A spokesman for O\u2019Neill told the Washington Post that he was participating in the big-money event 'as a favor to a friend who has been helping him out'. On its website, ForAmerica\u00a0claims to spearhead a new conservative movement on social media. Its introductory texts says that conservatives are 'outnumbered and being hit on both flanks', which it identifies as 'the radical Left' and moderate Republicans. O'Neill leaped into the public spotlight last autumn, coming forward to identify himself as the solider previously known only as The Shooter on Veterans' Day last winter. He spoke at length to Fox News about his exploits in a two-part documentary, and has made numerous speaking engagements since. However, his public discussions of a top-secret mission have angered many in the SEALs, including top commanders who said he was breaking the organization's code of honor by seeking fame. It later emerged that he was being investigated by The Naval Criminal Investigative Service for allegedly revealing classified information. An NCIS spokesman today confirmed that the investigation is still active.",

A handwritten notebook in which Britain's Enigma machine genius Alan Turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $1million (\u00a3690,000).

Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game, said:\u00a0'Alan Turing was a war hero, who broke the Enigma code helping to bring an end to World War II, the father of modern computing science, and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result. 'His impact on our everyday lives is enormous, and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling.' The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy. Turing (left) wrote the notes at the Bletchley Park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science. The notes are believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript (right) known to exist, the auctioneer said . Pages of notes show the inner workings of Turing's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests . The notes, which are highly personal, show Turing working through different equations and considering different results . Gandy gave the papers to The Archive Centre at King's College in Cambridge in 1977. But he kept the notebook, using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist. Bonham describes Gandy's entries as highly personal; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995. At the beginning of his journal, Gandy writes: 'It seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of Alan's on notation, but possibly a little sinister; a dead father figure, some of whose thoughts I most completely inherited.' In a statement through Bonhams, Turing scholar Andrew Hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how Turing 'remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics.' Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the Oscar-nominated The Imitation Game (left), said: 'The thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling' In some Turing elaborates on his conclusions, writing that one result 'is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition' He added: 'Alan Turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value.' Turing committed suicide in 1954. He was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in Britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952. He agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to 'cure' his homosexuality. It will be sold by Bonhams in New York on Monday. It said the seller wished to remain anonymous.

But unlikely as it may seem, Niamh Geaney, 26, and Karen Branigan, 29, aren't the only pair to have found their real-life doppelg\u00e4ngers, either by mistake or after a social media hunt. Now three similar British cases have been revealed; a London-based journalist who found hers in Birmingham, two male university students, also in London, and two retired men in Essex. Scroll down for video . What are the odds? Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, (right) moved to Braintree in Essex to be confronted with his doppelg\u00e4nger, former head teacher\u00a0John Jemison, 74, (left) Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old TV presenter from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' last week in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Just last month, retired priest Neil Richardson, 69, moved to Braintree and was surprised to greeted with waves and 'hello John' greetings wherever he went. 'John' turned out to be John Jemison, a 74-year-old former head teacher who was well-known to the town, and just so happened to look exactly like Mr Richardson. Upon meeting, the pair, who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised that as well as being doppelg\u00e4ngers, they had an awful lot in common. Both had attended the same college, and both became RE teachers and choir singers. The pair finally came face-to-face in March when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a Friends of Braintree Museum visit to the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library. 'It was quite spooky,' said Mr Jemison, adding that they 'hit it off immediately' and are now friends. 'My only worry is the number of people who probably think I've been ignoring them when they've been saying \"Hello John\" to Neil all this time.' Upon meeting, Mr Richardson (left) and Mr Jemison (right), who are both grandfathers-of-four now living just 150 yards apart, also realised they  had a lot in common in terms of their life stories . Mr Richardson married his wife in 1968 (left) while Mr Jemison also married wife Jenny in the sixties (right) In 2011, Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed became fascinated by the idea that there might be someone out there in the world who looked exactly like her. In fact, she was the inspiration behind Miss Geaney's ultimately successful social media search. In much the same way, Ms Robehmed launched her mission to find her doppelg\u00e4nger by publicising it on Facebook, YouTube, and through blogs around the world. And just like Miss Geaney, it turned out that Ms Robehmed didn't need to look that far. Her closest match turned out to be Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher, who worked in the film industry and shared a mutual friend. Devon-born journalist Sophie Robehmed (right) launched a hunt to find her 'twin stranger' in 2011 and found\u00a0Birmingham native Lauren Hatcher (left) through a mutual friend . After seeing Ms Hatcher's photo, Miss Robehmed set up a meeting in Covent Garden in London, and the rest is history. And in another accidental result, doppelg\u00e4ngers Jonny Sandgrove and Michael Harris, both based in London, got to know each other at university. As cases of mistaken identity around the campus began to mount up, the pair met, again though mutual acquaintances, and ultimately became firm friends. Doppelg\u00e4ngers Jonny Sandgrove (left) and Michael Harris (right), both based in London, got to know each other at University, after friends kept getting them confused . When Mr Harris married his then-girlfriend Naomi a little while later, several members of his family approached Johnny at the wedding to congratulate him. All this comes after Miss Geaney and Miss Branigan's story blew up across the media yesterday, for being the most twin-like case yet. Miss Geaney, a TV presenter, found Miss Branigan after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called Twin Strangers. This is the moment that Miss Geaney (right) met her doppleganger Miss Branigan (left) for the first time . 'I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me' Miss Geaney (right) said about Miss Branigan (left) The aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website TwinStrangers from across the world. Incredibly, Miss Geaney found Miss Branigan in just two weeks - just an hour away. After their first meeting she said: \u2018I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn\u2019t get over her face. \u2018And some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \u201cOh my God that\u2019s my face\u201d. I can\u2019t remember the number of times I said \u201cthis is so freaky\u201d. It was truly amazing. Uncanny: Miss Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Miss Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . \u2018I would say Karen is the shyer of the two of us,\u2019 said Miss Geaney. \u2018But then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me. I\u2019m the weirdo that contacted Karen and asked her to meet me.\u2019 Miss Branigan, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Miss Geaney has two sisters and a brother, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Since meeting, Miss Greaney and Miss Branigan - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'. Miss Branigan (right) turned out to be a fellow Ireland native who lived just an hour down the road from Miss Geaney (left), making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together . She added, 'Some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, \"Oh my God that\u2019s my face\"' While Miss Geaney appears to have beaten her fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry and 22-year-old Terence, hands down, the search isn't over until April 27. 'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry English said. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence Manzanga. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!' Miss Geaney (right) said she and Miss Branigan (left) got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities (pictured) Friends for life? Since meeting, Miss Geaney (right) and Miss Branigan (left) - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly' Feedback: Shocked reactions to \u00a0their story have flooded in from far and wide . Challenge: Miss Geaney's (right) fellow Twin Strangers participants, 21-year-old Harry (left) and 22-year-old Terence (centre), are still looking for their doppelg\u00e4ngers, and the search isn't over until April 27 . Miss Geaney, who is still promoting the project across social media with Harry and Terence as interest spreads, says there will be no prize for the winner, just 'pride'. They are inviting others from around the world to join in too now, by adding users' photos to their Facebook album. 'There is a huge human curiosity element to it,' She said. 'Can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you?'",

The oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a Catholic saint was believed to be the work of a 'follower' of 16th century renaissance master El Greco. But the selling price suggests the untitled, undated and unsigned painting may actually have been done by the artist himself. Auctioneer Richard Bromell (pictured) gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 but it ended up selling for more than \u00a3120,000 . It was acquired by the owner's late father in the 1970s for very little. He bought it because he believed it was a depiction of Saint Peter, who shares his name. And it was inherited by his son, who has not been named, who kept it in his loft for the past eight years before deciding to sell it following a clear-out. Auctioneer Richard Bromell, of Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset, gave the work an estimated value of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400. But after advertising the sale, interest in the work took off. And feverish bidding, final hammer price was \u00a398,000 and came to \u00a3120,932 with all the fees added on. Mr Bromell said: 'I rung the client after the sale and just told him it sold for ninety-eight. He asked 'what pounds?' And I told him it was \u00a398,000. 'He said he needed to sit down. When he came down off the ceiling he was very, very pleased. I think if he had been offered \u00a3500 for it before the auction he would have snapped your hand off.' The oil painting (right) was believed to have been the work of a follower of\u00a016th century renaissance master El Greco (left) but the selling price suggests it may have been done by the artist himself . Mr Bromell explained it was very difficult to judge the painting. He said: 'We described it as by a follower of El Greco because that is what it looked like and I still think that to be the case. 'It was a very interesting picture and very hard to value. 'If you asked three people the question 'how much is it worth?' you would get three different answers. One reputable gallery stopped bidding at \u00a310,000 because that was how much they were prepared to pay for it. 'Obviously as least two people thought it was worth the money because the bidding just went up and up. 'We must have advertised it well because all the right people attended the sale. On the day of the sale I thought it might go for a few thousand pounds so we were obviously delighted with the outcome. 'People play their cards very close to their chest at these things and the person who bought it came in and was only interested in this item and nothing else.'",

Great fast bowler Ambrose never spoke to the media during his playing career but launched his aptly titled autobiography Time to Talk on the eve of the West Indies-England series. Ambrose was one of the West Indies stars, along with Sir Viv Richards and Richie Richardson, who accompanied Stanford when he flew by helicopter to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch his five-year deal with England that ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence, just one $20million T20 game into the contract. The England cricket team's involvement with  Allen Stanford  has been defended by  Sir Curtly Ambrose . Stanford's deal with England England ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence . Ambrose wrote: 'I wasn't surprised the England Cricket Board officials were taken in by him. We all were. His vision to improve West Indies cricket by using England seemed a hard one to argue with. But we felt that having England as the same opponents over that period would turn things stale.' Richardson said: 'He employed a lot of people in several businesses and built a stadium. He did a lot of good. We thought what he was doing was legitimate.' Richards added: 'To a lot of fellers here, he did well.' Ambrose accompanied Stanford when he flew to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch the deal . The new ECB president Giles Clarke\u00a0did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy saying it was a long time ago . However, the new ECB president Giles Clarke, who negotiated the doomed deal and greeted Stanford on his arrival at Lord's with a bear hug, did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy. Before the Wisden launch last week at which he made a fool of himself by haranguing both the guest speaker and Wisden editor Lawrence Booth, Clarke would only say of Stanford: 'That was all a long time ago.' Perhaps it's no surprise, with Stanford's decaying cricket stadium just outside Antigua's airport there for all visitors to see, that Clarke is swerving today's first Test on the island. Michael Vaughan might still be a long way from agreeing terms and working patterns to become England's director of cricket. But he is staying at England's luxury Sugar Ridge Hotel in Antigua, so he's right in the middle of any politics going on over the appointment of a director and ideally placed to judge the mood music of players and management.

Lancaster has a speaking engagement a week today in aid of the Dallaglio Foundation along with Sir Clive Woodward, Lawrence Dallaglio and captain Chris Robshaw at a \u00a3225-a-head function.

The xylella fastidiosa bacteria has ravaged olive trees in the Puglia region and contributed to a 35 percent drop in the region's olive oil production last year. Its spread has so alarmed the EU that France announced a boycott of Puglian fruit and vegetables, while its effect on production will mean shortages in the supply of olive oil and is likely to lead to higher prices for shoppers in Britain and around the world. An Italian forestry official stands guard as workers begin chopping down an infected olive oil tree . Police officers were also on hand to maintain order after protesters attempted to stop the trees' destruction . A forestry official walks past the fenced-off remains of an olive oil tree destroyed in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease . A forestry worker cuts through the stump of a tree infected with the deadly xylella fastidiosa bacteria . Puglian growers have opposed the government's destruction plan, saying it won't stop the bacteria's spread . However, Puglian growers have opposed the government's slash-and-burn plan, saying it won't contain the bacteria's spread. Several dozen protesters tried unsuccessfully yesterday to block the first seven trees from being felled in Oria, near Brindisi, even climbing the branches and shouting 'assassins.' Eventually, the first seven trees were cut down and are to be burned today, with more to follow. Many of Italy's oldest olive groves, some dating back 500 years, have been infected by the bacterium, which causes plants to shrivel, leaving them incapable of bearing fruit. Puglia, a region in the heel of Italy, produces about 11million tons of olives a year, more than a third of the national crop, and they are used to make some of the country's best oils. The initial area to be culled is 20,000 acres \u2013 about 30 sq miles \u2013 between Lecce to Brindisi. It contains around 11million trees, according to Unaprol, the largest consortium of growers. It is feared that unless drastic action is taken to fell the groves, the bacterium will spread to other olive-producing regions of Italy such as Tuscany and Umbria, and even to other Mediterranean countries. Last month Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for Food Safety and Security, said he was 'profoundly concerned by the gravity of the situation'. He added: 'We have to take decisive measures with immediate effect. Naturally it is very painful for the growers but it is necessary to remove all the affected trees, it is the most effective measure.' The bacteria (right) causes plants to dry out, leaving shrivelled stumps that are incapable of bearing fruit. Pictured left are protesters sitting in the branches of an olive oil tree earmarked for destruction . The microbe, first identified in the Americas, has now infected 800,000 trees in Salento, the southern half of Puglia, the heel of Italy . Below is a summary of the Italian virgin olive oil market worldwide, according to Unaprol (organisation of Italian oil producers), showing the main importing countries: . USA:\u00a0Italy holds a market share of 51 per cent, with exports up 2 per cent in 2013. AUSTRIA:\u00a0Italy is the market leader in 2013 with a 48 per cent share.

Romantic Ben Parsons, 34, of Brighton, East Sussex, stunned girlfriend Anna Jefferson, 36, by getting down on one knee after running 24 and a half miles. She was watching her boyfriend run in the Brighton marathon with their children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months. Ben Parson, 34, paused in the middle of the Brighton marathon and proposed to his surprised girlfriend, Anna Jefferson, 36 . Anna feared her boyfriend was struggling when he started to slow down on Hove seafront, because she was unaware of his proposal plan. Ben then got down on one knee and popped the question and Anna said yes, before Ben ran onward towards the finishing line, still managing to get a personal best timing and completing his sixth Brighton Marathon in 3hrs 36min. Ben, a media law lecturer at the University of Brighton, carried the ring in his bum bag and waited to spot Anna in the crowd on Sunday. He said: 'I wanted to do something romantic to surprise Anna and the marathon has such a feelgood, loved-up atmosphere anyway so I knew it would be the perfect time. Ben Parson had already run 24.5 miles of the 26.2-mile Brighton marathon when he stopped to propose to girlfriend and mother of his two children, Anna Parsons . At the time, Anna had been stood in the crowds with children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months . 'Judging by the look on her face, she was certainly surprised. 'Once Anna had said 'yes' and we'd had a big sweaty hug I had to get on the move again so my legs wouldn't seize up. 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com. 'I had an extra spring in my step for the last mile and a half.' 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com': After Anna said yes, Ben carried on with the marathon . He said that the pressure of the proposal spurred him on and brought the finishing line a bit closer. But he joked: 'If I hadn't seen her in the crowd maybe I would have just carried on to the end and taken the ring back to Argos.' Anna, who works for Arts Council England, and has been dating Ben since they met at City College Brighton in 2002, said she never expected the proposal. She said: 'There had been a guy just before him who had got a cramp and had to stop for his friends to massage his leg. Newly-engaged: The happy couple are stood after the surprise proposal with their two children . 'Then Ben started slowing down and I thought 'oh god he's going to collapse or something'. 'I had no idea what he was planning. 'In hindsight he had suggested before that I wear something nice so we could go out for something to eat afterwards.

The Spaniard has come in for criticism for persisting with trying to get his side to play out from the back despite results suffering recently.

But while he may persist in wanting to play the same way he said that does not mean his tactics are rigid. 'The people who say that I am tactically not flexible are people who do not follow my work,' Martinez told the Liverpool Echo. 'I have been innovative at every football club I have been at with my tactics, my shape and my approach. 'I am not someone who needs to defend myself but if you follow my work then I am probably one of the most flexible managers tactically that you could work with.' Martinez tinkered with the shape of his side in Saturday's victory over Southampton, their third successive league win, as he switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation with Gareth Barry the solitary holding midfielder with his regular central partner James McCarthy pushed further forward. He explained he made the change to compensate for the absence of leading scorer Romelu Lukaku, who is still recovering from a hamstring injury. 'It was because we didn't have Romelu,' he added. 'In certain games we played with two strikers. On Saturday we had Aaron Lennon really high up the pitch and James McCarthy had freedom. 'Every game is different. Southampton have a very strong back six that needs to be broken in different ways. 'We don't play the same way twice, but it is not for me to go openly and publicly and tell everyone what we have done.' Martinez insists that his tactics are 'innovative' and points to his changes made against Southampton .

Carver is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer \u2013 or deflect \u2013 questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis, distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul. But as reported by Sportsmail last month, senior sources within St James\u2019 Park have indicated that Derby boss Steve McClaren will take over in the summer, regardless of whether or not the Rams are promoted from the Championship.

Some of it is deserved and some of it is not. \u2018Sometimes you\u2019re dealt the hand and you\u2019ve got to get on with it and this is the hand I\u2019ve been dealt. \u2018When I took it on, if I hadn\u2019t accepted then I would have been kicking myself. \u2018And I\u2019ve said this before, I genuinely believe that if I\u2019ve got the right tools I can do the job. \u2018But it is bitter sweet at the moment. This job is definitely a rollercoaster.\u2019 Website AshleyOut.com are co-ordinating Sunday's planned boycott. They will protest outside of the Gallowgate End before kick-off and after the game. During the match they will go to Leazes Park behind the stadium. Carver, though, has urged fans to get behind the team. Fans are unhappy at how Newcastle are being run under Mike Ashley and have planned a boycott . \u2018I would go to the match because I support the team,\u2019 said Carver when asked if he would stay away as a supporter. \u2018I think they (boycotters) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues. I respect those issues. \u2018I never thought I'd see this to be perfectly honest, especially in the North East of England because we love football. \u2018So obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come, and I respect that.\u2019 Carver has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against Tottenham Hotspur .",

A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. He said: 'Combined with the suggestion that boxes may have been on top of the smouldering cigarette, compressing and containing the heat, this made it more likely items would ignite. The salon was totally gutted when an inferno started by a discarded cigarette ripped through it. The 16-year-old girl who started the fire was today told she will not face trial for arson as she had only been 'careless' The family of Stephen Hunt visit the scene where he died. The girl who started the fire is said to have dropped a cigarette while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight . Firefighters enter the remains of music venue NQ Live in Manchester which was also destroyed by the fire (left). Dozens of floral tributes to fireman Stephen Hunt were left at the scene (right) 'It was a hot day and there was a gap beneath the door and as a result experts were unable to exclude a chimney effect as air was drawn under the gap underneath the door and the fire began. 'The conclusion is the Crown's case, which had previously been based on scientific evidence which excluded accidental ignition, can no longer be sustained, so I offer no evidence.' The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Throwing the case out, Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I spent some time reading the papers and reports and it is perfectly obvious this terrible and tragic case demonstrates the danger and potential danger from discarded cigarettes. A fireman patrols the scene in Manchester's Northern Quarter where his colleague was killed. More than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral . More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as passers-by watched on . 'This was discarded without any thought and as a result a fire started in circumstances which were particular to the site in question, resulting in extensive damage and costing the life of a man who, as part of his employment, was there to protect life and property. 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.' In September 2013 more than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral. In a tribute to him at his funeral, his son Sam said: 'To me, he wasn't just my dad but my hero, my role model and my best friend.' Following the hearing today, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We have made no comment on any aspect of the incident and are unlikely to do so until the coroner's inquest into Stephen's death has concluded. 'Safe to say we continue to work with everyone involved in various investigations to find the truth of what happened, not least for Stephen's family but for everyone involved and especially our firefighters.'",

In spite of the defeat which prompted her predecessor's resignation, the SNP leader has racked up support across Scotland since, with some fans even hopeful of a victory on May 7. But weeks after having to deny allegations of back-room plotting against Ed Miliband, Mrs Sturgeon has been rocked by more smearing claims yet. For with just two weeks to go until she canvasses polling station queues, the 44-year-old has been accused of savage violence. The SNP leader (pictured right, aged 14) has denied her sister's claims she used to shave the heads off her sister's Barbie dolls . According to her sister, Gillian Owens, the politician was prone to hacking the hair of from dolls as a child. 'She once cut the hair off my Sindy doll, just for fun,' Gillian Owens, a part-time actress, said. Rebutting the claims, the politician told the BBC: 'I deny the allegations levelled at me by my sister. 'I'm sure I didn't cut the hair off her Barbie doll. 'But if I did it - and it's an \"if\" - then there would have been provocation involved, I'm sure of it.' Later posting on Twitter, she added: 'For the record I think my sister is misremembering. I'm sure it was a Sindy doll. #dollgate.' Poking fun at the tale, she told one follower: 'I'm not proud of it... but I've changed. My niece's have never come to any harm.' The accusations sparked a Twitter trend with internet users sharing mocking photographs of beheaded Barbie dolls on Saturday afternoon. The politician poked fun at her sister's claims which sparked a Twitter trend on Saturday afternoon . Twitter users were quick to join in on the joke, sharing photographs of beheaded dolls on the social network . One user shared this photograph of the SNP leader as a murderous doll herself, holding a pair of scissors . A joke Twitter account was set up in the name Barbie Sturgeon in the wake of the claims this weekend . In an interview with The Sun, Mrs Sturgeon's sister told of how they were 'like chalk and cheese' growing up. 'I was into dolls and everything girly. Nicola was into sitting reading. She was a very strong-minded wee girl.' Polls suggest the SNP is on the brink of a landslide on a scale unprecedented in modern British politics, winning as many as 50 of Scotland\u2019s 59 Commons seats. That would be all but certain to leave it holding the balance of power at Westminster for the first time. Mrs Sturgeon did not attend a ceremony at the Cenotaph this morning with other party leaders to commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli Landings. Laying a wreath a Scottish memorial site instead she later attended an SNP women's rally in Glasgow City Centre. The SNP leader skipped the Cenotaph ceremony to join female voters in central Glasgow at a women's rally .",

Called High There!, the app is officially described as the world\u2019s first global social network for cannabis enthusiasts. The network is designed to let users meet one another online to make friends and form relationships without being judged for their habit or views. The High There! app is  described as the world\u2019s first global social network of cannabis enthusiasts. Users share their interests (left) and energy levels when using cannabis (right) as part of their profile . When High There! first launched two months ago, it could only be downloaded by users in the US who live in states that have legalised cannabis. But now it\u2019s available globally via Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play, after getting approval to widen its reach. The app quickly became popular in New York, California and Colorado, with 41,000 downloads in the first six weeks and it\u2019s expected to a hit in the Netherlands, Spain, England and Australia, Forbes reported. Users swipe to choose to connect to people - like in the popular dating app Tinder. When High There! first launched two months ago, it could only be downloaded by users in the US who live in states that have legalised cannabis (a joint is pictured) but a global version was rolled out yesterday . The medicinal properties of hemp are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs. Hemp is legal and unlike cannabis, contains little tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high. There are a rising number of firms in the US that sell biscuits containing cannabidiol extracted from hemp, believed to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help animals lose weight. Research has also suggested that CBD can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs. 'Due in part to their small body size, dogs and cats can take advantage of small amounts of CBD, THC and other cannabinoids found in hemp and can therefore reap the benefits of this great plant,' the firm said. 'We are not interested in, nor are we advocating the administration of, the well-known psychotropic compound THC, in concentrations sufficient to produce the 'high' or psychotropic effects which are normally associated with marijuana. 'We are not advocating the administration of marijuana, by any route, to animals in order to produce medical benefit or to produce any psychotropic effect.' The firm writes on the App Store: 'Chat with your connections and invite your friends who also want to engage in shared experiences within a non-judgmental environment. 'You can use High There! to date, go out with new friends, or simply connect with people who are like you. As we say, \u201cYou've got more friends than you think.\u201d' Denver-based Founder and CEO of High There! Todd Mitchem, said that the app doesn\u2019t encourage the sale of marijuana but is simply a social network for people who consider it part of their lifestyle. It deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana in their picture section. Despite the measures, Mr Mitchem said he was surprised that the app was allowed to go global. Writing on the High There!\u00a0blog, he said: \u2018This news was a surprise, but the allowance was made because we are a responsible social network and because we focus on building connections rather than just showing off your weed.\u2019 He\u2019s a former Chief Revenue Officer of hash oil maker, O.penVAPE and says that 12 million people use some form of the drug, meaning that there is a real opportunity to connect users on a social network. His motivation for rolling out the app widely is personal too, because his mother used the drug to battle cancer, which Mr Mitchem claims saved her life. \u2018To you, that mother just like mine, fighting cancer in a state where the stigma still exists around weed, High There! is here for you. His motivation for rolling out the app globally (illustrated with this image) is personal for Mr Mitchem, because his mother used to drug to battle cancer, which he claims saved her life . The app deletes the accounts of people who post photos of the drug in their profile picture and takes down images of marijuana (a stock image is shown) in their picture section . \u2018To all of you in states where cannabis is now legal, High There! is definitely here for you too! \u2018And to the countless women and men who simply want to meet other like-minded, amazing people in a non-judgmental way, High There! is here for you also.\u2019 The app has been likened to Tinder, which also lets users swipe through prospective friends and partners. At its regional launch,\u00a0Mashable reported that Mr Mitchem created the app after women didn\u2019t find him appealing on conventional dating sites, because he smokes cannabis. \u2018We wanted to build a cool piece of technology that solved the problem of where do million and millions of cannabis consumers go to meet people, connect with people and build relationships,\u2019 he said. \u2018A lot of people say we\u2019re the Tinder of weed, but that\u2019s only one facet of the whole thing. It\u2019s so much bigger. He says the network is actually primarily designed for platonic connections. \u2018As we open the platform to the entire planet, I am certain meeting new like-minded people will take on some exciting new paths,\u2019 he added.",

McCallum (left) was sentenced to 20 - 45 years' in jail for the killing of Francesca Weatherhead, who had only months before married her college sweetheart Matthew (pictured together right) Her death caused outrage when it was revealed McCallum had been paroled not five months prior - despite being sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison on his latest break-in and drug possession arrest. He had first been eligible for parole in September 2013 but was held longer because authorities thought he needed to complete a violence prevention program. Yet he was released just months later, after the Michigan Department of Corrections decided he successfully passed the program. During sentencing on Tuesday, McCallum told Mrs Weatherhead's husband he thought of what happened every day from inside his jail cell. He said: 'If I could have avoided the death of her, I would have. I would like to say I'm sorry,' the Detroit Free Press reported. Despite his contrition,\u00a0Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway sentenced him to 20-45 years in prison after he struck a plea deal with prosecutors in which charges of home invasion and reckless driving causing death were dropped. Mrs Weatherhead was driving to her job as a sales manager when McCallum ran a red light in his Ford Escape and struck her car. Francesca and Matthew Weatherhead pose for an engagement photo. The couple married in June but she was killed only months later . The two met at Michigan State University, where Matthew Weatherhead was going to medical school . She had married Matthew Weatherhead in June, and was putting her husband through medical school at MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. Mrs Weatherhead graduated from Trenton High School, where she played softball and was named homecoming queen. She went on to attend Michigan State University and graduated in 2010 with a degree in business administration and marketing. Her family previously expressed their dismay at losing such a beloved family member, The News Herald reported. Her younger sister Nina Vitale said: 'Words cannot express what an overwhelming feeling it is to lose someone so close to you. 'She was more than a daughter, sister, wife or friend. She was our strength and we are lost without her.' Mr Weatherhead told the court his partner was a wonderful wife and would have been a great mother .",

The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for\u00a0Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game,\u00a0USA Today\u00a0reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. Fighter: The NCAA moved the school's first game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball.\u00a0She scored the first and last baskets . Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released but\u00a0Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.",

Dr Adam Cobb\u00a0was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr. If convicted he faces 20 years' jail in the US. Dr Adam Cobb was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography\u00a0after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr . The 45-year-old was in the US working as a research professor and director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island. Cobb took up the position at the US Naval War College in June last year after holding senior military and government roles in Australia and the US, including a recent strategic policy and planning position at US Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. 'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr. The internet connection at Cobb's Portsmouth home was identified as the origin of the images. Cobb was in the US working as a  director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island\u00a0after holding senior military and government roles in Australia, including the RAAF . Laptops and mobile phones were seized from his home, while photos and videos of two females were also discovered on a storage device and a computer allegedly belonging to Cobb. Educated at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and University of Cambridge, Cobb built a reputation as a leading military thinker. According to his biography on the US Naval War College website, Cobb worked on the 1999-2000 East Timor crisis with Major General Cosgrove, who at the time was commander of the international peacekeeping mission. 'Overall, my commanders and I found Dr Cobb's work a valuable contribution to our understanding of important issues before us,' Maj Gen Cosgrove wrote in a review of Cobb's work as lead analyst for the Australian Parliament Defence Office. In Australia he was special-director, strategic policy with the RAAF; senior defence adviser for the Australian parliament; an Australian parliamentary fellow; and research fellow at Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre. Cobb has also worked at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC and was on the staff of former speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Dr Adam Cobb had worked for the federal government, the Royal Australian Air Force and Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove (pictured) in East Timor .",

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that the Washington Supreme Court did not act unreasonably when it rejected Clark Elmore\u2019s claim his constitutional rights were violated at trial. Elmore, who was convicted of killing Kristy Ohnstad in Bellingham\u00a0after he said she threatened to reveal he had molested her as a child, received the federal court's ruling on Wednesday. Clark Elmore\u2019s conviction for killing and raping his 14-year-old stepdaughter in Washington in 1995 was upheld . The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the Washington Supreme Court's (above) decision was correct . Ohnstad, a middle school student, was the daughter of Elmore\u2019s live-in girlfriend, the Seattle Times reported. After she went missing, Elmore pretended he was grieving and helped organize a search party to find her. Elmore is the second-longest serving inmate on the state's death row after being sent there in 1996 . He eventually admitted killing her in a graphic taped confession. Elmore claimed his rights were violated during the trial because his attorney gave him bad advice and the jury saw him in shackles. The three-member panel's ruling against the 63-year-old convict was unanimous. The panel wrote: 'We hold that the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of Elmore\u2019s constitutional claims was not unreasonable. 'The district court did not err in denying Clark Elmore\u2019s challenges to his conviction and death sentence, and we therefore affirm the district court's decision. 'Clark Elmore committed a truly monstrous crime. 'A state that has chosen to impose the death penalty can surely reserve it for such an offense.' The ruling does not mean Elmore will now be executed as Governor Jay Inslee has declared a moratorium on the death penalty. Elmore is the second-longest serving inmate on the state\u2019s death row - he arrived there in 1996 - although he is now effectively serving a life sentence due to the moratorium on executions. He may still ask the US Supreme Court to review the 9th Circuit court\u2019s opinion .",

Like Paul, the Kentucky senator who made a name for himself by\u00a0championing issues not typically associated with the GOP such as criminal justice reform and privacy protections, much of the 'Rand' 2016 SWAG is unconventional. Rand fans will still find the usual array of yard signs and bumper stickers. But they'll also have the opportunity to sport their support  through Macbook skins and woven blankets that feature Paul's face, 'Stand with Rand' flip-flops and car mats and a host of other unique items like the 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker.' Scroll down for video . Libertarian icon Rand Paul has expanded his campaign store to include an array of unconventional SWAG, including the 'Rand on a Stick' item feature above, as he kicks off his presidential campaign . An ophthalmologist by trade, the store contains eye charts bearing Paul's name and his campaign slogan because 'we need a president who can see clearly,' as the site states . For $75 Paul fans can own a throw rug featuring the Kentucky senator. It also comes in a Constitution theme for the same price . 'Sure it might be fun to have Rand in your living room at night engaging in deep discussions about objectivism, libertarianism, conservatism and a few other isms,' the description for the item reads. 'In the absence of that, curl up on your couch with the Rand blanket. It's the next best thing to him being there.' The freshman senator's expansion of his campaign store to include 'Paul for president' items preceded an announcement this morning on the website that said: 'I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government.' An unofficial candidate for the last year, the statement made formal the tea partier's entry into the 2016 contest a few hours before he was scheduled to hold a campaign kick-off in his home state. He'll spend the rest of the week rallying supporters in early presidential primary states New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada, in that order, before making his back to Washington for his day job. The Senate is currently in the midst of a two-week break in honor of the Easter and Passover holidays. Loyalists of the 52-year-old freshman senator and his father Ron, a former Texas representative who sought the presidency in 2008 and 2012, are known for the fervency of their support and organizational skills. Tonight they'll celebrate the younger Paul's entry into 2016 competition with 'Stand with Rand' #LibertyKaraoke parties across the country. Running on the slogan 'Defeat the Washington Machine, Unleash the American Dream' and promoting himself as 'A Different Kind of Republican,' Paul's campaign store reflects the 52-year-old lawmaker's efforts to appeal to a new generation of conservatives- fiercely independent young adults who are just as likely to vote for GOP politicians as they are Libertarian candidates or nobody at all. Playing off the Stand with Rand theme, the description accompanying a pair of $20 sandals in the store says, 'no, really stand with Rand in official campaign flip flops.' Beer steins and t-shirts rock an 'unleashed' dog wearing patriotic sunglasses and holding an American flag in his mouth. The item bound to draw the most attention, however, is the campaign's 'NSA Spy Cam Blocker' that allegedly protects users from the preying eyes of the government. 'That little front facing camera on your laptop or tablet can be a window for the world to see you - whether you know it or not!' the item's page warns . For $100 Paul's supporters can purchase branded versions of cornhall, the bean bag toss game that's especially popular with the southerners from Paul's native region . And for $1,000 they can become the owner of an autographed Rand Paul pocket Constitution.

The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside\u00a0Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate\u00a0as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.",

Farage, the leader of  the UK Independence Party (UKIP), complains that Britain's membership of the European Union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants, many from impoverished Eastern Europe, into his \"small island\" nation. In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain. \"The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr. Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40,\" Zylinksi said. Holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a  World War II war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet. \"Enough is enough, Mr. Farage. So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"I would like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would traditionally do. \"Are you up for it Mr. Farage?\" Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince. \"It is an impressive sword. I don't have one but I'm sure we could find one if we had to. But I'm not intending to accept the offer,\" a spokesman quoted him as saying. \"I would have thought that a Polish prince with a long Polish lineage would rather agree with me that it's a complete tragedy for Poland that it's lost so many of its brightest and best young people.\" UKIP wants Britain to leave the European Union. It says it would not seek to remain a party to the region's free trade or economic treaties \"while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor, which prevents the UK managing its own borders.\" It has also pledged to cut the country's \u00a39 billion ($12.4B) annual foreign aid budget. Another UKIP politician appeared to back his party leader's chances in a duel, tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two, with the comment: \"This is what Nigel would do to him.\" But there was no word on whether Farage would even accept the prince's less life-threatening back-up challenge. \"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections,\" Zylinski suggested. \"I'm up for it, it would be really nice, hopefully you will agree.\" Zylinski posted a separate video on YouTube entitled \"7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,\" in which he pointed to a Times newspaper headline from March reading: \"We need more migrants ... they are the best workers in Britain.\" The headline, he said, applied \"principally\" to the Poles. \"What I cannot accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the Poles. Enough is enough, I say, this has got to stop.\" Zylinski pointed to Polish contributions to Britain including  those made by Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, what he said was a \"wonderful work ethic\" and easy integration into the community. \"We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know,\" he said. \"We are very grateful to be here. We would like you to be grateful too. Please stop knocking the Poles. We love this country we would like British to love us too.\"",

The makeshift tattoo session took place in Mr Moffatt's living room with a \u00a370 ink gun bought online. The NHS worker was drunk at the time and said he now considers the inkwork a 'nightmare'. He said: 'I'd never picked up a tattoo gun in my life and I got told by my brother not to do, but I just didn't listen. 'Now, my family are always saying \"you're an idiot, Tom\" and there are plenty of jokes at my expense from my mates. I can't repeat what they say about it. 'I have to hide my arm when I go for interviews. Even Riley has started to notice and points at those tattoos and says \"daddy, I don't like those ones\". It's a nightmare.' Among his homegrown tattoos, Mr Moffatt also has a wonky cross on his forearm, which he drew just a few months after Riley's birth in 2012. He has just endured his second hour-long laser removal session in a bid to get rid of the botched needlework.

He said: 'I've got a long journey ahead of me to get them all off and I pressed it so deep in one that it's going to be very difficult to get it off.' Mr Moffatt, who also has a two-year-old daughter Kya with partner Rachael Higgins, 23, now wants to use his experience to highlight why people should not attempt to draw their own tattoos. He said: 'Once I've got them off, my job isn't done. We want to try and get a campaign going so people like me can't just go out and buy a gun with no questions asked. 'You shouldn't be able to go on the internet as a 15-year-old Joe Bloggs and buy one. I want to get the message out there that tattoos should only be done by professionals.' The owner of the Maria Patricia Tattoo Removals, where he is being treated, says Mr Moffatt's situation is a stark warning against the dangers of unregulated ink work. Maria said: 'There needs to be more regulation. People don't realise the dangers of the buying off tattoo guns and ink off the internet. 'Tom did just that and had to Google the instructions of how to use it. It might seem like a laugh with mates when you're drunk but it's not easy to fix the damage and people can be left with scarring if they're not careful. 'We're all for tattoos but people need to be aware they can wreck lives and make it difficult to get jobs.'

CCTV footage from one of the raids in Tipton, West Midlands, shows the gang using umbrellas to conceal their entrance as they burst into a supermarket, where they stole cash from the offices. Scroll down for video . Umbrella thieves: A gang of armed robbers used pink brollies to confuse staff as they raided 13 shops in a two-month crime spree in the West Midlands . The gang  also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives and screwdrivers, before punching one employee in the face. In a separate raid, the men stole the store manager's Mercedes E200 which they used as their getaway car. The group have now been jailed for more than 27 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob. Police caught the thieves following a raid on an Asda supermarket in Coseley, West Midlands, where they were armed with hammers and what was reported to be a gun in a plastic bag. Detectives then used forensic evidence found on the weapon to link the various burglaries, before executing search warrants on the homes of the four suspects. During the searches, police found fluorescent jackets, identical to those used in the raids, along with banks statements showing large transfers of cash. Armed:\u00a0The gang also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives, golf clubs and screwdrivers . They also discovered numerous cash bags from a shop known as Farmfords, one of those targeted by the group, as well as \u00a32,500 in cash. Mobile phones found at the addresses also showed several calls made between the group, while number plate analysis linked the defendants to the areas where the crimes had been committed. Liam Bell, 19, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, and 22-year-old Trea Richardson, from Hansworth, were arrested in June last year, at the time of the warrants being executed. Marcus Morgan, 21, from Tividale, West Midlands, went on the run for five months before being detained in November. Guilty: Ashleigh Evans, 26 (left) from West Bromwich and Marcus Morgan, 21 (right) from Tividale, West Midlands, were jailed for ten years and seven years respectively for their parts in the 13 robberies . Jailed: Liam Bell, 19 (left), from Rowley Regis was jailed for six years and six months while Trea Richardson, 22 (right) from Hansowrth, was sentened to a four-year jail term . Ashleigh Evans, 26, from West Bromwich, was arrested on a flight back from Amsterdam. Officers even found the umbrella captured on CCTV in his luggage. On Friday, Evans was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Bell was jailed for six years and six months. Richardson received a four-year jail term while Morgan was sentenced to seven years. Sentencing Morgan, Recorder William Mousley QC said to Morgan: 'No doubt you would have seen the fear in the eyes of the people you were robbing yet you carried on thereafter. 'It was not a one-off, it was a course of conduct you decided to engage in quite freely for a few weeks. 'This was professional, commercial robbery for significant financial gain where people were disguised and premises targeted that were vulnerable where people worked hard for not much money. 'They were not the type of premises where workers would expect people like you to come in and rob the store. The only mitigation I can find other than your guilty plea is your youth.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Rich Whitehouse, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The money and value of goods stolen, while significant, is nothing compared to the impact these offences have had on the staff members of the targeted premises. 'These offences were carefully planned and the group went to great lengths to conceal their involvement, often using umbrellas as cover when walking from the street to the shops, so as not to draw attention to their face coverings. 'However, the more offences they committed the more arrogant they became. There was also a clear escalation in the type of weapons used in the robberies and I am in no doubt they would have gone on to seriously hurt someone had they not been stopped.'",

A voyeur who used a hidden camera to film up women's skirts as they bent over freezers in Lidl has been spared jail. James Webster targeted\u00a0female shoppers at the Lidl store in Maidenhead, Berkshire, as they hunted for bargains in the large chest freezers. The 35-year-old was caught after attracting the attention of a fellow shopper, who spotted him moving the bag he was carrying closer to his unsuspecting victim. Security guards discovered Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could carry out his covert filming. He admitted outraging public decency at a previous hearing and was warned that he could face prison. But Webster walked free from court after magistrates sitting in Slough, Berkshire, ordered him to complete a sexual offences treatment programme, as part of a three year community order. Opening the case, Helen Gambrill said: 'On January 12 the defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead and outraged the public decency, namely filming up the skirts of women in that store. 'That offence came to light when a member of the public saw the defendant and thought he was acting in a strange way.' The court heard the shopper spotted Webster positioning his satchel, with a lens protruding out, under the skirt of a woman. Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing. However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper he turned himself in to police. Webster  immediately showed remorse, telling a police officer, 'I threw the camera away in frustration on the day I did this.' He accepted that his actions had a sexual purpose but admitted he had no idea why he had carried out the crime. Francis Domingo, defending, said Webster had been struggling to deal with a break-up at the time and was incredibly ashamed at his actions. 'From the moment I've seen him, I can tell you this - Mr Webster has expressed nothing but sincere remorse over what took place,' he said. Webster, now of Fengate, Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean, the court was told. Webster had targeted women as the shopped at Lidl in Maidenhead, Berkshire (pictured) Sentencing him, Presiding magistrate Mark Lovett said: 'We note the early guilty plea and the fact that you were very upfront about it from the very beginning. 'You were remorseful for your actions. 'On the other hand, you did show obvious intention - you went equipped. This was hardly accidental.' He added: 'The other point I have to make is that you're not 18, you're 35, for goodness sake. 'That kind of action from someone of your mature years is quite extraordinary.' Webster was handed a three year community order  and was ordered to take part in a sexual offences treatment programme. He was also told to pay \u00a385 in costs and a \u00a360 fine.",

The High Court ruled today that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of \u00a314.6 million  for birth injuries, after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour. The hospital's negligence led to her son James Robshaw, now 12, being born with cerebral palsy. The decision, believed to be one of the most significant in a case of medical negligence and the largest ever such court-ordered award for birth injury, reflects the lifetime care that James needs. Suzanne Adams' son James Robshaw was born with cerebral palsy after she hospital staff failed to carry out a Caesarean section or properly monitor her during labour . James cannot speak, dress or feed himself (without assistance of a machine) and must use a wheelchair. His intellect has remained fairly well intact and he communicates through sophisticated eye-gaze equipment. He will however be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life. While the exact sum has yet to be confirmed, MailOnline understands the minimum payout  will be \u00a314.6m. To date, the biggest medical negligence payout has been around \u00a315 million - and Ms Adam's lawyers hope to exceed this amount. Ms Adams was in  labour when she was admitted to Lincoln County hospital in 2002. Although her baby's heart was monitored after her arrival, midwives either ignored or could not interpret the CTG trace - which detects foetal heart rate - correctly. James had an abnormal heart rate and was evidently in some distress and Mrs Adams was exhausted by a prolonged labour. Today, the High Court ruled that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay Ms Adams in excess of \u00a314.6 million for birth injuries - the largest ever court-ordered award for birth injury . James, now 12, cannot speak, dress or feed himself and must use a wheelchair. He will be dependent on others to enable him to carry out the most routine daily tasks for the rest of his life . The confusion about CTG interpretation and the additional failure to carry out a timely Caesarean section meant there was a delay in delivering James. Resuscitation procedures were then carried out in the delivery room before he was transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit. The sum ordered by the High Court includes money to pay for all James\u2019 needs including: . * 24 hour care provided by a team of live-in carers. * Significant modifications to his home to allow James to use his powered wheelchair and access bathroom, kitchen etc. * Hoisting and tracking equipment to lift James in and out of wheelchairs/bed. * Disability equipment. * Therapists including physiotherapist, speech & language therapist, occupational therapist, AAC therapist, orthotist, orthoptist, psychologist. * Adapted vehicle to enable James to travel in his wheelchair. * Sophisticated eye-gaze equipment to enable James to speak and communicate with people and carry out his school work. * Funding for James\u2019 additional educational needs. Ms Adams' lawyer, Denise Stephens, a partner with law firm Access Legal, argued that had the Caesarean section had been carried out - or hospital staff had monitored the baby\u2019s heart rate properly - the midwife could have identified that James was in distress. In either event, he would have been delivered much sooner and so would not have suffered any injury. Ms Stephens said: \u2018This is a tragic case of an avoidable accident at birth which caused devastating injuries. 'James is a bright 12 year old lad with a wicked sense of humour and perhaps the most distressing aspect of this case is the loss of the life James could have had if he had not been injured.\u2019 The United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust finally admitted liability for James\u2019s injuries in 2009 - seven years after his birth. However it took a further six years to fight for damages for James. Speaking today, Ms Adams said: \u2018The family has been through a very difficult time. '[The situation] has taken its toll on family relationships and my mental health and I am still on medication for depression and anxiety. 'It was difficult to cope on my own at first and the interim payments my solicitor obtained transformed our lives. 'The award will help James realise his potential. 'But no amount of money can ever make up for the mistakes that have condemned my amazing son to a lifetime of dependency on others.' Pauleen Pratt, acting chief nurse at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'The Trust and the NHS Litigation Authority are deeply sorry for what happened and for the impact this has had upon James and his family. 'The Trust accepted, in 2009, liability for the injuries which James sustained during his birth some 12 years ago. 'Although we cannot turn back the clock, we hope that the compensation, once agreed, will provide the reassurance that James\u2019 future care needs will be met.'",

The Finn stated this week he has never been happier working with a team in his entire F1 career, although his form to date has not matched that of team-mate Sebastian Vettel. Kimi Raikkonen has been urged to improve his performances if he wants to stay at Ferrari . Sparks fly as the Finn overtakes\u00a0Pastor Maldonado during practice ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix . In particular, Raikkonen has let himself down in qualifying, although has recovered well in the last two races in Malaysia and China to finish fourth. The 35-year-old has certainly shown he has the speed and, given his state of mind, appears keen on staying. According to Arrivabene, however, results have to improve.

A 26-year-old man wanted for the\u00a0murder of his mother and sister has been arrested\u00a0after being spotted by a member of the public. Peter Fox, from Liverpool, was arrested at Euston Station in London\u00a0this morning on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette, 57, and Sarah Fox, 27, following a nationwide manhunt. Detectives released CCTV images of the 26-year-old  leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm on Wednesday and arriving at Euston railway station in the capital at 10.57pm. The body of his sister  was found by police on Thursday night, just hours before her 57-year-old mother Bernadette was found dead at sheltered accommodation just half a mile away in Bootle, Merseyside. Merseyside Police said Mrs Fox died of asphyxiation, while her daughter was repeatedly stabbed. Bernadette and Sarah's family today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Rooney from Merseyside Police said: 'I can confirm that a 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette and Sarah Fox this morning and is being brought back to Merseyside. 'A significant amount of work has been carried out over the weekend with the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police and I would like to thank them for their assistance. 'I would also like to thank the media and the public for their support during the weekend, which has helped us enormously.' In a statement issued through police, a spokesman for the Fox family said: 'We are absolutely devastated following the loss of Bernadette and Sarah and are still trying to come to terms with what has happened to them both. The family of Bernadette (left) and Sarah (right) have said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss . 'Bernadette, who was a mother of three and grandmother of three, was a very outgoing and lovely person who wouldn't harm anyone. In fact she only ever had nice things to say about people. She was so caring and would help anyone. 'And Sarah was loved by her family and well-liked by her friends and neighbours. She was a fantastic aunty and was a cheeky, bubbly and outgoing person who loved her dog. They will both be greatly missed. 'We would ask that people appreciate that this is a sad and tragic time for the family and that we are left alone to grieve in peace, whilst we try to understand what has happened.' The family urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police to help them 'find justice for Bernadette and Sarah'. Sarah Fox's body was found around 9pm on Thursday night after police received a phone call about her welfare. A neighbour had reportedly raised the alarm after seeing a dog loose on the streets. Detectives released CCTV images of Peter Fox arriving at Euston Station (right) in the capital at around 10.57pm on Wednesday night after leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm (left) Another neighbour living close to the flat, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw one of my neighbours in the street who said he was worried after he noticed the dog from the flat roaming the streets, he had seen it a few times so he knocked on the door but got no answer. 'He called to the house last night and noticed there was a downstairs window open and the back door was ajar.' It was then that the police were called and officers found Sarah Fox's body, who they said had suffered 'multiple injuries'. 'It's so shocking. I've spoken to the girl from those flats before two or three times, she seemed a nice girl,' the neighbour added. Bernadette Fox was found when police arrived at her address through other enquiries. One neighbour near the sheltered housing property, who did wish to be named, said: 'The girl's name was Sarah - people called her Foxy - and her mum was Bernie. Police launched a double murder inquiry after the bodies of two women were found at separate addresses in Bootle, Merseyside. Pictured, officers outside a property in Worcester Road . Sarah Fox, 27, was found dead with multiple injuries at around 9pm on Thursday evening, after police were called to Worcester Road (pictured) over concerns for her welfare . 'Bernie was harmless and Sarah I think had worked at a solicitors nearby, Bernie had a son as well. 'The place where Bernie lived was sheltered accommodation and it had cameras all over the place. 'There's a camera over the intercom so anyone letting someone in would see them. It's a hard place to get into.' Martin Stevenson, Director of Older People's Services at Your Housing Group, said yesterday: 'Tragically a body was discovered at one of our Roger Arden Court sheltered scheme apartments in Bootle this morning. 'Merseyside Police attended the incident and we are continuing to support them with their investigations. 'Our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the deceased at this difficult time.' Patricia Doragh, who lives in a property near the flat, said: 'It is quite a rough area around here especially up the side streets. 'The police are always up and down the main road it's not a rare thing, it's a street quite well known for alcohol. 'When I took my grandsons out earlier about 12 o'clock there was nothing here and now all the cordons are up.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation. 'I want to reinforce the message that you should be abiding by directions, if the train station is closed, you don't climb over onto railway tracks, It is a shame that people have taken it upon themselves to do so on this occasion.'",

In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It's very, very dangerous. It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.",

Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: \"I think it's time.\" 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I\u2019m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'",

The new policy allows for an American traveler who has been denied boarding a commercial airliner to petition the U.S. Transportation Security Administration once to find out whether he or she is on the no-fly list and a second time for an unclassified explanation of why he or she is on the list. In some cases, the government will not be able to provide an explanation because of national security concerns. The changes partially lift a veil of secrecy enshrouding a policy that has been a centerpiece of the government's counterterrorism efforts since the September 2001 terror attacks. Grounded or not grounded? Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the U.S. Above the security line at New York John F Kennedy International Airport in October . But the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit, said the changes don't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to, including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it. The explanations provided to six travelers so far, which were mandated by a federal judge, have been inadequate, the ACLU said. For instance, in a letter to New Jersey resident Amir Meshal, the government's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the FBI obtained from Meshal when he was detained in Africa in 2007, ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said. The ACLU considers Meshal's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse. 'From the face of the letter, a neutral decision-maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred,' said Shamsi. The Justice Department declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said, 'We are committed to a process that protects Americans from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties.' Last fall, there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, according to the government. Typically, less than 5 per cent of those on the list are Americans. The list fluctuates in size. Previously, the government's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list, citing national security concerns. In most instances, travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they can't board their flights. Travelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007. Only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list, the government has said. The TSA gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year, and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no-fly list, said Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron. In 2014, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list of their status on the list, and seven were told they were not on the list. The government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no-fly list, including Meshal. One of the explanations included just a 'single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country,' according a court document filed earlier this year. The letters to the six plaintiffs on the no-fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs' reputations, Shamsi said. 'The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again,' Shamsi said. The TSA will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy. The changes are not yet in effect, and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the Portland lawsuit, but the Homeland Security Department said it expects them be in place soon. Catron said individual requests should take months to process, not years. 'These enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within, or bound for, the United States,' Catron said.",

The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to \u00a330,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as\u00a0The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down. It was replaced by The Bristol Brewery Georges, which has since closed and been converted into flats. As it is today (right) Many uses: There was a builder, undertaker and joiner stationed at\u00a0Broad Quay Bristol when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855 . How Broad Quay Bristol looks now. It has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat . Little difference: The view through St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works . High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 . St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now . Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was\u00a0destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940.\u00a0Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed . Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol.\u00a0The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s . Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again . Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone . Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol.

Shaun Ingram booked his Ford Focus ST in for a major service and MOT at Halfords Autocentre in Plymouth last month, costing \u00a3255. But when he went to collect his car, he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken by a dashcam fitted by Shaun Ingram to his Ford Focus ST, which showed a mechanic taking a customer's car for a joyride at 57mph in a 30mph zone . Shaun Ingram, from Saltash in Cornwall, who discovered the footage, says it shows it was a pre-planned thing, not spur of the moment . Mr Ingram, 50, of Saltash in Cornwall, said that his camera recorded almost seven hours of footage, which included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car. He explained: 'When I saw the footage I was left open-mouthed. The mechanic was abusing my car and my trust. 'As a nationwide company I thought I had nothing to worry about. But I feel very let down. 'From now on I will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced.' Mr Ingram, who is a married father-of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for Dairy Crest, said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor. He said: 'I was not trying to catch anybody out. I bought the camera- ironically - from a Halfords store in Plymouth last year. The dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after Mr Ingram left his car at the Plymouth branch of Halfords . Footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam. It also showed\u00a0included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test-driving the car . 'I have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive. 'I did not look at the footage on the Friday afternoon when I picked the car up. 'I saw it the next day and I almost choked on my pasty. The biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit. 'I then decided to look at all the footage. There was one clip of him reversing the car off the MOT bay and leaning over to tell a colleague \u2018you wait til I road test this later.\u2019 'That shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car. Mr Ingram says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor . 'There is another clip of him constantly swearing when he can\u2019t find the key sensor. 'I have not been given his name and I don\u2019t need to know unless I get a speeding ticket. 'There is no point getting really angry about it. But it is fair to say I was open-mouthed when I saw the footage. 'I took the laptop in on the Monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when I showed him the footage. 'Had he apologised then I would have left it. But I have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology. At least they have started to take it more seriously though. 'I look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly \u00a310,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this. 'I would never have known about it if I did not have the camera. I did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money.' Halfords have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in Plymouth, who has since been removed from this role. The company described his behaviour as \u201cappalling\u201d and offered to refund the cost for the MOT and service. The regional manager for Halfords Autocentres, Darren Stone, also told Mr Stone in an email that the mechanic\u2019s behaviour was unacceptable. He said: 'He drove your car in what I can only describe as an appalling manner. 'I do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the Halfords Autocentre Group.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Halfords head office said: 'We were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down. 'We are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at Halfords. 'Please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 Halfords Autocentres always adhere to all road test procedures.'",

Cardboard cutouts or waxworks of more than 60 celebrities including Bob Dylan and Marlon Brando were on the cover picture, which was the brainchild of artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth and photographer Michael Cooper.

Following the shoot on March 30, 1967, Mr Cooper's photography assistant was given the 20-inch tall cardboard gnome as a souvenir by the band, who each signed it. The model has emerged for sale almost 50 years later after being listed for auction by a private collector. Auctioneers in the US have valued the gnome, which has some water damage, at about \u00a317,000. Dean Harmeyer, of Heritage Auctions, said: 'This is a true rarity and a cornerstone piece of any Beatles collection.' The album cover ended up being so extravagant that the final cost of producing the artwork was \u00a33,000 - a whopping \u00a350,000 in today's money. The front and back of the gnome were then mounted alongside an unopened copy of the Sgt Pepper's vinyl LP. 'Designer Peter Blake worked with the Beatles to stage the cover of Sgt. Pepper's, which was filled with life-size cardboard likenesses of famous figures - Mae West, Bob Dylan, Marlon Brando - behind the Beatles,' Mr. Harmeyer explained. The Gnome has been valued at \u00a31,700 and was singed by all four members of the band after the shoot . On the shoot: Assistants organise the set for the artwork which cost \u00a33,000 - the equivalent of \u00a350,000 today . 'At the end of the cover session on March 30, 1967, the gnome was chosen as a memento by an assistant to cover photographer Michael Cooper, and it was signed by the Beatles immediately following the shoot. 'The gnome is in two parts - both front and back were created by Blake for the shoot, and presumably joined together, which may explain the small holes at the top and bottom of each. 'The Beatles have all signed the back in the lower, lighter portion in green marker. 'There appears to have been a liquid spill to on the back after the signing, which has affected the Ringo and John signatures. 'Both the front and back elements measure approximately 20 inches high by 5 inches wide. Both gnome elements are framed with a vintage, unopened stereo copy of the LP.

Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green. History was assured. He wasn\u2019t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters. He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn\u2019t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130 . Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history . Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn\u2019t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn\u2019t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods\u2019s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole. If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall. Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth\u2019s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before \u2014 but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too. \u2018I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,\u2019 Spieth confirmed. \u2018I was going to have to work around Henrik\u2019s line \u2014 and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss. \u2018I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it\u2019s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to set a record is awesome.\u2019 Spieth broke Raymond Floyd's 36-hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes . At the age of 21 and playing in his second Masters, Spieth looks in complete control . Billy Horschel, Spieth\u2019s playing partner, had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day. Horschel deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message \u2018Nice hole, Jordan\u2019 as they stood on every tee. Nothing changed overnight. Many had Augusta pegged as the venue where Rory McIlroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015; instead, this Masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young Texan gunslinger, now in the vanguard of an American revival. Up ahead of Spieth, Ernie Els laboured valiantly to stay in touch. It was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career. At the age of 25, as McIlroy is now, Els won his first major, the 1994 US Open. He was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade, and he won it again in 1997. By that time, however, a 21-year-old called Tiger Woods had announced his arrival at the 1997 Masters. The era of Els never materialised. McIlroy may have achieved more and younger than Els, and Spieth may not be the ice-cold winning machine Woods was at his age \u2014 but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days. Already in the record books, Spieth has many more landmarks in sight these next two days. The record for birdies here stands at 25 from Phil Mickelson; Spieth already has 15. His course management was outstanding. Spieth took Augusta on, yet remained entirely in control. It helps that he is exceptional, yet strangely unspectacular. As Graeme McDowell pointed out recently there are better drivers, better chippers, better putters \u2014 and the statistics bear this out \u2014 but none who do all three as well as Spieth. He might not have the best game; but he has the most complete. There were tiny aberrations \u2014 he found the pine straw twice on the back nine \u2014 but they were rare. Most of the time, he was consistency personified, picking out the best line, the best lie, the most advantageous position on the green. When he dallied with a bunker on the par-five eighth, his third shot was so perfect that he sunk a two-foot putt for birdie. Spieth made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the Augusta fairways and greens . The young Texan pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round . \u2018That was special, even for you,\u2019 said Horschel\u2019s caddie Micah Fugitt. It was a masterful display, the work of a wise head not a callow college boy. It isn\u2019t just that Spieth doesn\u2019t think like a 21-year-old. At the 15th, a par five and a good birdie opportunity, he sensibly laid up, and then made four. Even when he missed, he missed cute. He has absorbed a lot from his mentor Ben Crenshaw, a fellow Texan and Augusta expert. Asked about \u2018Ben\u2019s advice\u2019 on Thursday, Spieth sweetly replied: \u2018Do you mean Mr Crenshaw?\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a hint of irony in his response. Had he stayed in school, he would be studying for his finals right now. Instead he is fast approaching \u00a310m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major. The next Tiger? That is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders. The idea that McIlroy is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked. When Spieth shot 63 to win the Australian Open at Royal Sydney, the conditions were windy and inhospitable. McIlroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made Spieth\u2019s score. Geoff Ogilvy claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in Australia. Where do Spieth\u2019s first 36 holes stand in the annals at Augusta? Ray Floyd played the previous best 36 holes \u2014 13 under par \u2014 in 1976. Spieth now has that record, as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18-hole lead. Like McIlroy\u2019s US Open victory at Congressional in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books. He has barely put a foot wrong. Nice hole, Jordan? Seriously, dude, name one that wasn\u2019t. Spieth recovers from among the trees at 13, and his caddie Michael Greller has to hand it to him (below)",

Another hurdle on their way to the Premier League has been negotiated as they secured a hard-fought win over Reading. This was tense, though. Manager Eddie Howe would testify to that. But winning a place in the top-flight has never been easy; Bournemouth are finding exactly that out. Callum Wilson celebrates after opening the scoring for Bournemouth in the fourth minute . Wilson opens the scoring for Bournemouth early on against Reading at the Madejski Stadium . READING: Federici, Gunter, A Pearce, Hector, Obita, Chalobah (Appiah 67), Karacan (Williams 59), Ake, McCleary, Mackie, Robson-Kanu (Aiyegbeni 81) Subs not used:\u00a0Kelly, Norwood,  Andersen, Stacey . Booked: A Pearce, Hector . BOURNEMOUTH: Boruc, Francis, Elphick, Cook, Daniels, Ritchie, Arter, Surman, Pugh (Smith 69), Kermorgant (Pitman 75), Wilson (Jones 90) Subs not used: Camp, Gosling, Fraser, Ward . Goal:\u00a0Wilson 4 . Booked:\u00a0Boruc, Francis, Wilson, Smith . Referee:\u00a0Keith Stroud . Attendance: 18,917 . But, as of yet, the Cherries aren't choking, Callum Wilson's 22nd goal of the season setting them on their way to a third successive win at the Madejski Stadium. Howe said: \u2018It was nervy, with what\u2019s at stake it was always going to be that way. We defended for our lives and showed incredible mental strength. It was a different kind of win than we\u2019re used to, but results are the most important things now. \u2018I\u2019d much rather we were playing total football and doing what we\u2019ve done all season, but we are finding a new way to win and I\u2019ll take that at this stage.\u2019 There was no doubt over which team needed the three points more. This victory secured Bournemouth's position in the top-six, meaning - at the very least - that they'll have a crack at promotion via the play-offs. Reading, under Steve Clarke, have all but secured their Championship status, and with an FA Cup semi-final date at Wembley against Arsenal on the horizon the Royals, perhaps, had other matters on their mind. And so it proved as the Cherries took a fourth minute lead when Wilson fired home from close range after Andrew Surman's shot from the edge of the area struck Adam Federici's far post. It was exactly the start Howe wanted as they looked to maintain their position at the Championship summit. But the visitors had goalkeeper Artur Boruc to thank in the 17th minute as he produced an outstanding one-handed save to deny Jamie Mackie's close range effort from Jordan Obita's cross. And Nathaniel Chalobah, Hal Robson-Kanu and Obita all waste good opportunities to level for the Royals as they mustered a promising response to going behind. These were worrying moments for Howe, who paced regularly from the dugout to his technical area to holler instructions at his players. And despite Yann Kermogrant sending a towering header from Marc Pugh's cross narrowly wide during the dying seconds of the first-half, Bournemouth's early mojo had vanished. Bournemouth's Simon Francis (left) on the run with Nathaniel Cahalobah in hot pursuit . Players appeal to referee Keith Stroud (right) as Wilson lies injured on the ground . Howe would have been happy to get his players in at half-time; his side, in truth, were starting to rock. That's what pressure does to a team. In fairness to the Cherries, though, not once did they part with the passing principles that have put them on the brink of automatic promotion. And the south-coast club looked to have regained their composure during the opening exchanges of the second half. Though, goalscorer Wilson was booked for diving in the 55th minute as the striker took the necessity for points too far. Yet, despite his side's improvement, Howe looked far from comfortable in his technical area. And Bournemouth were struggling to create the opportunities that would have calmed their manager's obvious nerves. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe (centre) and his players applaud the travelling support . There were nervy moments for the travelling Bournemouth fans as the end of the match approached . One mistake, one moment of magic from a Reading player and this match would have been back in the balance. Not only the match, but his side's chances of automatic promotion. Matt Richie went within inches of providing Howe and his team the cushion that they desperately craved in the 63rd minute. The Royals defence made a mockery of trying to clear a Bournemouth throw deep inside their half, the ball eventually fell to Richie who let fly with a curling left-footed effort that skimmed the top of Federici's far post. Steve Cook then saw his half-volley from the edge of the area held by Federici as the visitors started to turn the screw. Wilson (bottom) is challenged by Reading's Alex Pearce during the Championship clash . Reading manager Steve Clarke gestures to his players but the hosts could not find a way back . But Reading refused to lie down, and had Danny Williams not miskicked in the final six minutes then the hosts could easily have pulled level. Wilson missed a glorious chance to seal victory for Bournemouth in the 87th minute, but his control let him down at the vital moment. And the visitors had endure some terrifying moments as Reading laid siege to the Cherries goal. But Howe's side held on for another vital victory as their promotion bandwagon rolls on... just.",

The 250-piece\u00a0Lilly Pulitzer for Target\u00a0collection sold out online and flew off of shelves at stores shortly after debuting on Sunday morning. Lilly Leas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the late Palm Beach fashion trendsetter, managed to buy a floral-printed hammock online, but only because she set an alarm. Meanwhile, Mrs Pulitzer's own daughter Liza wanted a beach chair - but missed out. The 58-year-old Palm Beach Realtor told the Sun Sentinel\u00a0that her mother, who died in 2013 at the age of 81, 'would have loved the fact that everybody wanted to get something, a piece of Lilly'. Scroll down for video . Family style: The late Lilly Pulitzer (center) and her daughter Liza (right) wore the designer's patterns in 2005. Liza admitted that she was unable to purchase any items from the brand's Target collaboration . Designer demand: Shopper Loren Boyce posted this picture of a cleared-out Target store on Sunday, writing that the racks were empty within five minutes . 'I think wearing a Lilly dress and wearing a Lilly print makes people smile, and the fact more people would have the opportunity - I liked that,' Miss Leas added of the Target collection. The Lilly Pulitzer merchandise - which included clothing, accessories, and homeware from the designer at Target's lower price point - attracted thousands of enthusiastic shoppers who logged online early and waited in long lines outside Target stores before they opened. And while all of the popular products have now officially sold out, more than 30,000 pieces have been listed for resale on eBay, many at higher price points, prompting angry customers who were unable to walk away with Lilly Pulitzer merchandise to boycott the second-hand sellers. A posting being shared on social media reads: 'Here's a tip to those who missed out on purchasing today. BOYCOTT all second-hand seller of Target's Lilly Pulitzer Collection UNTIL the prices drop below cost. Don't be desperate to beat someone else out for a $30 dress.' Just say no: Angry Lilly Pulitzer fans took to social media to start a boycott against second-hand sellers of merchandise . Just say no: A Twitter user named Amanda noted that pieces from the collection will be returned to Target if everyone bands together and refuses to bid on any of items on eBay . Colorful addiction: This woman was photographed with a cart full of patterned home d\u00e9cor\u00a0from the Lilly Pulitzer for Target collection . Different opinion: Not everyone was a fan of the collection; this Twitter user named Ponta couldn't believe that women were willing to spend so much on the patterned designs . The message continues: 'If no one buys from eBay or Instagram - groups that are currently price gouging - they'll be forced to drop the prices in a few weeks. This only works if everyone refuses to buy from any second-hand seller. #ForcedAccountability #LillyForEbay.' Other Twitter users noted that the highly-coveted items from the Lilly Pulitzer collection will be returned to Target and restocked if everyone bands together and refuses to buy from second hand sellers. '#LillyforTarget has a 14 day return window. Boycott #LillyforEbay and there will be stock in stores in about 13 days,' one person tweeted, another added: 'Can we all just make a pact to not buy any of the\u00a0#LillyforTarget aka #LillyforEbay Absolutely ridiculous [sic].' Speedy re-sellers first started earning bids for their purchases at up to ten times the retail price, including a $150 hammock for $799 and a $34 maxi dress for $202.50. A $30 tote bag was posted with a Buy It Now asking price of $300. Disappointed: Robin T was angry that Target didn't set a limit of how many pieces customers could purchase at a time . Wise woman: Esta Fiesta, who previously shared her tips on shopping designer collaborations, noted that people should have listened to her strategies . Shocking mark-up: Mary Hall encouraged people to buy 'real' Lilly Pulitzer instead of spending hundreds on the Target collaboration being sold on eBay . However, within 24 hours, many more sold-out items became available on eBay for under $100, including a $9.99 makeup bag that sold for $19.99 and a $15 headband that sold for $30. Many of the thousands of re-sellers bought pieces in bulk with the intention of auctioning them online for a profit - a practice that angered some shoppers, who complained that these scalpers ruin the fun for 'true' fans of the brand. 'There's a special place in hell for those who bought items just to resell on eBay,' one woman wrote on Twitter. Another said: 'The people who bought hoards of #LillyforTarget products just to resell\u00a0them online are (literally) the reason we can't have nice things. [sic]' Nothing left: Many people took to social media to share photos of the empty shelves at various Target stores . Band together: Keily Collins told people to avoid buying any of the pieces on eBay . Better idea: She added that she would rather go to a Lilly Pulitzer store and buy something from there than purchase anything from second-hand sellers . No human decency: Meanwhile, Carolyn Heard noted that 'people are the worst' while encouraging others to join the boycott . Other customers also complained of problems using Target's website on Sunday morning; 'extreme traffic' caused site crashes and difficulty completing purchases. Target's chief merchandising and supply chain officer Kathee Tesija apologized for the issues regarding the store's website on the company's blog on Tuesday, saying the experience customers had on Target.com on Sunday morning 'wasn't acceptable', while denying that the site had crashed. 'Our goal is to provide an easy, fun experience, whether guests are shopping online or in our stores. We didn\u2019t get there with this launch and for that, we\u2019re sorry,' she said. 'The website never crashed, but due to high traffic, it was slow and our guests had to wait longer than they should have to access the full collection.' She added: 'That\u2019s frustrating, both for them and for us. We\u2019re taking a close look at what happened. We\u2019re committed to constant improvement, and are laser focused on providing our guests with a great, seamless experience.' Ms Tesija also addressed the outrage over second hand re-sellers of the collection. Fast fashion gets faster: Lilly Pulitzer's lower-priced collection for Target sold out almost immediately online and in stores; customers re-selling this $34 maxi dress were netting bids over $200 . Pricey prints: Pieces like this Lilly Pulitzer bag, left, and hammock, right were quickly available at major mark-ups online, though more affordable resell prices have popped up since the initial rush . 'One of the things we\u2019re incredibly passionate about at Target is making great design accessible and affordable,' she said. 'When we see product that we\u2019ve created for our guests being resold on the secondary market for a profit, it\u2019s disheartening because it takes away from the very intent of these programs.' She continued: 'When we look at the amount of Lilly Pulitzer for Target product being resold, it translates to roughly 1.5per cent of the collection. While we\u2019d prefer that number to be zero, it tells us that the vast majority of guests who purchased the collection did so with the intent of enjoying it for themselves.' But though frustrated fans\u00a0criticized\u00a0Target for poor planning and a lack of bulk-buying policies, these are\u00a0hardly new experiences for customers who have taken advantage of the store's past designer collaborations. The highly-anticipated diffusion lines are promoted for months in advance with ads, lookbooks and celebrity-packed parties, resulting in hordes of fashionistas adding the on-sale dates to their calendars. In 2011, Missoni's collaboration with Target crashed the website as well, and collections from Prabal Gurung, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Peter Pilotto all saw marked-up resell value on eBay after selling out in stores. Bait for the belles: 'The things Southern girls do for @LillyPulitzer #LillyforTarget [sic],' wrote customer Michelle Christine  of the line outside a Richmond, Virginia Target store . Hollywood ladies love Lilly: Celebrities including (L to R) Camila Alves, Kate Bosworth, Bella Thorne, and Ellie Kemper all wore Lilly Pulitzer for Target dresses to the line's launch party .",

Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg . A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday . A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday . At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA.\u00a0Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow . 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' an RSPCA spokesperson told Fairfax media . There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said . The taskforce was established to investigate the use of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets to train competitive greyhounds. It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

Following one stunning round with another happens about as often at Augusta National as pieces of litter drifting across the property. Here, the youngest first-round leader in Masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36-hole record total of 14 under par, beating the old mark of 13 under set by Ray Floyd way back in 1976. It also tied the lowest 36-hole total seen in a major, set by three others, including Sir Nick Faldo at The Open. Jordan Spieth chips on the 17th hole during the second round of the Masters on Friday . Spieth watches his tee shot from the 16th in front of a packed crowd at Augusta . The 21-year-old walks past the scoreboard on the 18th hole following his sensational performance . Dustin Johnson eyes up a putt no the 18th green during his record-breaking display on Friday . Johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course\u2019s scoreable par fives to devastating effect. He had eagles at the second and the 8th, birdied the 13th, before striking a wondrous blow to the 15th that pulled up 12 inches from the flag. The difference between him and Spieth is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67. Johnson will start the third round seven behind his fellow American with game chorus line member Charley Hoffman two strokes nearer the lead following a creditable 68. Gutsy Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey are on the same mark as Johnson, with the former weighing in with a fine recovery of his own. Rose was three over par after four holes but rallied strongly after drawing a line on his scorecard, like you\u2019d draw a line in the sand. He played the last 14 holes in a plucky five under for a 70, while Casey underlined he is a man reborn with a terrific bogey-free 68. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68, one shot ahead of Ernie Els (72), while Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69, his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors, and his first here since 2011. He is still no fewer than 12 shots behind, mind. What of the world No 1, Rory McIlroy? Alas, if it\u2019s Friday it must be time for one of those freaky nine holes that just kill him at the Masters every time. Ernie Els hits a shot off the fourth tee during his second day of action . Last year it was on the back nine and this time the outward half, as he followed a bogey at the 7th with a double at the 9th to turn in 40 strokes. It\u2019s the sixth year in a row the Northern Irishman has thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he addresses the problem, he simply cannot win a green jacket. At least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he has made mentally from the days when his shoulders used to slump. One shot outside the projected halfway cut mark, he birdied the 10th and then, at the 13th, the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past, he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap-in eagle three. McIlroy missed from 3ft at the 14th for a par but, in a rousing finish, birdied the 15th, 17th and the 18th. To the accompaniment of loud rumbles of thunder in the distance, McIlroy came home in just 31 shots to stand alongside Woods on two under. Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69; his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors . Woods's girlfriend\u00a0Lindsey Vonn watches on from the crowd during the second day of action . Texas golfers have a long and proud history of coming up with prodigious feats that stun the sporting world. Byron Nelson once won 11 events in a row on the PGA Tour in 1945. Ben Hogan won three major championships in succession in 1953 and probably would have won the fourth as well but for the fact The Open clashed that year with the USPGA. Now here comes Spieth, who to this point has turned this Masters into his very own \u2018hello, world\u2019 moment with an awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we haven\u2019t seen since another 21-year-old named Tiger walked away with the 1997 edition. All this on the day another Lone Star legend, Ben Crenshaw, waved goodbye to the Masters. It\u2019s tempting to talk about a passing of the Texas torch, except Spieth is destined for a level of greatness twice Masters champion Crenshaw could only dream about. Think Hogan rather than Gentle Ben. Rory McIlroy reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what was a frustrating day for the World No 1 . Paul Casey tries to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole . As for Tiger, his first round 73 was actually an awful lot better than his score and the reviews suggested. It was, in fact, the most encouraging signs we\u2019ve seen for him for well over a year. His short game was back to its best and his task on Friday was to instil some rhythm in his long game. That is exactly what happened. The rare sight of him finding the first fairway was encouraging and even better was the laser iron that followed. It finished 10ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole. For 15 minutes, it was like watching Tiger at his best. The rest of the round was also heartening. He reached the turn in 34 to be one under for the event and inside the top 20. Justin Rose flips his club into the air after the English golfer cleared a sand trap on the 13th green . Ben Crenshaw closed out his Masters career with two mediocre rounds at Augusta . A birdie at the 11th and he was on the fringes of the top ten. How he does over the final two rounds is one more fascinating question during a weekend featuring many. Els was trying to build on the small miracle of his opening 67. The South African finished eighth on his Augusta National debut in 1994. Two months later, at the age of 25, he claimed the United States Open. Everyone looked at his languid grace off the tee and gossamer touch around the greens and wondered how many green jackets he would win. Twenty years on, he\u2019s still waiting for his first. But he\u2019s still in there trying. Depending on your viewpoint, his 72 leaves him perfectly placed to take advantage if Spieth feels the pressure over the weekend; or well in the mix to notch his third runner-up finish at the Masters. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68 just one shot ahead of Els .",

Sterling is stalling on a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer, although he insists it has nothing to do with money and he will reassess his options at the end of the season. The 20-year-old, who has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs, was one of four players at the Anfield launch of next season's New Balance kit in front of over 1,000 fans, with one shouting from the crowd 'Make sure we see you in it next season'. Liverpool's attacking midfielder Raheem Sterling is stalling on a new big-money contract at the Anfield club . Sterling (centre right) poses with Martin Skrtel (left), Simon Mignolet (centre left) and Daniel Sturridge (right) The four Liverpool players huddle together on stage at the launch of their new home kit for next season . Sturridge uploaded this to his Instagram account as he posed with Sterling, Mignolet and Skrtel at the launch . Sturridge posed with his team-mates and uploaded these snaps to his Instagram account . That made the youngster slightly more uncomfortable than he already was perched on a stool on stage, and speaking afterwards Sturridge said having regular football - which he is virtually guaranteed at Liverpool but possibly not elsewhere - was a key consideration for Sterling. 'I don't know what Raheem wants to do but it is just important to be able to play regularly,' he told Press Association Sport. 'As long as he is playing regularly he will be happy - I don't think it is anything to with anything other than that and I hope he will stay at the club. 'It is important, regardless of who you are, to show what you can do - not just for Raheem but any young player. 'It is important to play games and gain experience so whatever decision he makes I am behind him 100 per cent.' Sturridge experienced something similar himself when he left Manchester City for Chelsea aged 19 but things did not pan out how he would have liked at Stamford Bridge and he left for Liverpool in January 2012 after 63 appearances in four years. As he matured he has enjoyed greater success at Anfield, scoring 40 goals in 67 appearances but his good form was interrupted this season by a five-month absence with a thigh problem. Since returning in January he has scored four times in 15 games and some of his performances have drawn criticism simply because he has not matched the heights of last season when, playing alongside Luis Suarez, he scored 24 times. Daniel Sturridge is bidding to return to his best form following a lengthy spell out through injury . However, the England striker knew he would not rediscover his best form immediately, which he believes will only come with a full pre-season under his belt. 'It has taken time to get back into the groove. I have missed a lengthy time and gaining sharpness while playing games is not easy in a league like the Premier League - you can't ease yourself back in because the games are very fast,' he added. 'It has been a difficult season in terms of the injuries but I know I will come back strong and get back to exactly how I was performing before. 'It is going to take time, it is not going to happen overnight, I understand that. 'It is the sharpness and fitness side of things. It takes a long time and that is the whole point of having a long pre-season. 'I am looking forward to helping the team this season and towards next season I will be right back to where I was, because I would have had a pre-season I will be back to the sharpness and fitness levels I had before.' Sturridge has been criticised by some supporters for failing to hit the same heights he did last season .",

Some are dressed in jeans and shoes - they have no kit or boots. Stories of strife are swapped. 'I'm only here so I can get a shower,' \u00a0says one as he rolls a cigarette. 'The wife booted me out a week ago and I've been on a settee since.' Jesper Blomqvist helped coach youngsters from Manchester United Foundation's Street Red project . Another is reflecting on how this kickabout, for those who may have suffered from mental health issues, is the latest tentative step on a long journey back from the brink. 'I was on a bridge over a motorway,' he says as he looks into the distance. 'They sectioned me for five years.' Into this environment walks a man who knows all about adversity. Jesper Blomqvist, he of hand in sleeve and knee often in cast, is back in Manchester. The Swede, now 41, was a key cog in Sir Alex Ferguson's treble-winning machine, making 38 appearances in that memorable season following a \u00a34.4m switch from Parma. The midfielder (left) was a crucial player in Manchester United's treble winning season of 1998-99 . But his 67 minutes in the late, late Champions League Final win over Bayern Munich in Barcelona would be his last in a red shirt. Three operations and two gruelling years of rehab later he was on his way to Everton but would continue to be haunted by injury before eventual retirement. He is here on Sunday to coach youngsters from the Manchester United Foundation's Street Reds project, but given his background he may also be well suited to having a word with those vacating the pitch. Blomqvist now helps his brother lecture people on how to handle setbacks using his previous experiences . The years have been kind. Blomqvist's long hair remains and is now accompanied by a beard which makes him look suited to the role he currently performs. 'I lecture with my brother,' he explains. 'He's a psychologist so he talks about how to handle setbacks and how to keep on performing. I can relate to that and give some real life examples from my career both good times and bad times. We speak to people from companies who have team building days.' Blomqvist celebrates their semi-final win over Juventus with Steve McClaren (centre) and Dwight Yorke . Blomqvist had the world at his tricky feet when he signed for United in 1998. He was one of few players Sir Alex Ferguson had to try more than once to convince to move to the club, after he spurned the Scotsman's advances to sign for Parma and Carlo Ancelotti after a frustrating year on AC Milan's bench. 'I liked Italy,' he explains, apologetically. 'It was nothing to do with Manchester. I had learned the language and I had settled in. I enjoyed the life and I enjoyed Parma, but then Carlo Ancelotti left.' Blomqvist revealed that he rejected Sir Alex Ferguson the first time and signed for Parma in 1997 . Sir Alex Ferguson came back again and managed to sign up his man to compete with Ryan Giggs . Back came a determined Ferguson and this time he was successful, bringing Blomqvist to the club to compete with Ryan Giggs on the left. It went well. In that treble-winning year Blomqvist picked up three medals, although one was almost consigned to Catalonian turf in the celebrations that followed United's belief-defying victory over Bayern at the Nou Camp. 'I don't remember much about that night,' he reveals. 'It was high tension. Afterwards it was joy. I lost my medal on the pitch jumping around and I had to start looking for it. I was scared but I found it in the end.' The Swede (bottom left) started for United in the Champions League final victory against Bayern Munich . The Red Devils were involved in one of the most exciting comebacks of all time after winning the trophy . United have a quite sensational season, winning the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League . Then came injury. Blomqvist went under the knife three times and it was here where he learned the lessons he now passes on. 'You try to get your head down,' he says. 'Small goals. In a few weeks I can go on the bike, then a few more and I can go running. But it's hours and hours of rehab and you feel like an outcast. You lose the connection with everyone, especially if it goes on for a long time.' Eventually Ferguson called him into his office for the inevitable chat. Blomqvist in action for United during the 1999 Champions League final where they completed the treble . 'I remember that last discussion because I felt quite guilty,' he says. 'I had been injured for so long and they kept paying the wages. He said 'don't worry, this is football - you gave me one excellent year and we won everything'. 'When he said that it was as though a stone fell off my heart. It meant a lot to me that he could feel like that. 'Of course he phoned Water Smith and helped me to get a deal with Everton - it spoke volumes of him.' Blomqvist enjoyed his time at Goodison Park where he was restricted to 17 appearances. The 41-year-old had an injury hit time at Everton and only managed 17 appearances for the club . 'Without wanting to be disrespectful it was a smaller club,' he says. 'There were fewer people working there which made it feel more like a family and I enjoyed that.' During Blomqvist's nine months on Merseyside, Smith was replaced by David Moyes. 'I enjoyed playing for him,' he says. 'He was, is, a good coach. That's why I was surprised it didn't work (at United). It was always going to be really hard to take over from Sir Alex. Sometimes it's about getting the right job at the right moment. 'Maybe it was bad timing. The only thing I think he may have done wrong was to change too many of the staff. When you have such a winning concept its very dangerous to change too much. Of course he wanted to put his mark on the club so you can understand it but I think it backfired.' Blomqvist worked under Ferguson and David Moyes (right) and spoke highly of them both . After Everton, Blomqvist endured a short stint with Charlton Athletic ('I enjoyed London but I was injured all the time') before heading back to his homeland. He will, however, be back in the red shirt of Manchester United in when the club's legends team recreate that 1999 final against Bayern's veterans at Old Trafford on June 14. 'It's always competitive with Manchester United,' he says (Blomqvist set up Andy Cole for the equaliser in the 3-3 first leg at a packed Allianz Arena). 'I play with lots of the old teams I have been involved with but there's a difference with United. 'Nobody wants to lose. They are fit and ready.' Now, at last, so is he. All money raised from the legends match will go towards Manchester United Foundation\u2019s work in the local community.

Boasting front and rear lights, rear view mirrors and even a car horn, the team behind the electric Babel Bike say it is unprecedented in its approach to safety. And perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them. Scroll down for video . London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike. Called the Babel Bike it has a host of features including a roll cage. Crispin Sinclair (shown with the bike) is seeking \u00a350,000 of funding on site Indiegogo. The bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor . The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop. Crispin will be hoping a similar fate does not befall his invention though - and hopes the array of safety features will appeal to safety-conscious cyclists. He is seeking \u00a350,000 ($74,000) of funding on Indiegogo to bring his dream to fruition. The price might be a bit much for some, with the non-electric version retailing for \u00a32,499 ($3,693), and the full electric version \u00a33,499 ($5,170). Both are \u00a3500 ($740) less if bought through Indiegogo. May 2016 is the estimated delivery date for the bike at the moment. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike\u2019s innards. It doesn\u2019t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. \u2018In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can\u2019t assist at higher speeds (by law),\u2019 the team notes on their Indiegogo page. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike\u2019s innards . There is a holder for a smartphone on the front so you can keep track of vital stats . The controls for the Shimano 250-watt electric assist motor are located on the handlebars, and provide up to 50 per cent assistance. The battery has a range of 50 to 80 miles (80 to 130km). The bike is recharged by either removing the battery and recharging it at home, or with an optional electric-car-charging lead. At the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors, which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock.

But Crispin notes in a video that even all these safety features \u2018won\u2019t help in a collision with a turning bus or truck at a junction - by far the single biggest cause of cycling fatalities.\u2019 Transport for London says that 65 per cent of all bike fatalities in London are caused by trucks and buses cutting across cyclists. So the team designed a roll cage for the bike, which prevents it getting trapped under a vehicle. If a truck or bus comes into contact with the bike, it will hit the roll cage first and ensure the cyclist is pushed to relative safety \u2013 or at least, that\u2019s the plan. The side of the seat \u2013 also detachable \u2013 has foam pads to cushion against side impacts, while the shape has apparently being designed with aerodynamics in mind by former Red Bull F1 engineers. \u2018Our dream is to put a million more cyclists on our roads, and therefore take a million cars off them, and to do that we need to give cyclists their safety back,\u2019 said Crispin. Whether the bike will prove to be more of a success than his father\u2019s invention remains to be seen, though.",

But I think all these experiences will make them better. \u2018We\u2019re a team that\u2019s grown and changed quite a bit in the summer. \u2018We\u2019re obviously bitterly disappointed, more with the performance.

The world No 1 - now 103 places above Woods in the world rankings - is the favourite to win the Masters next week and claim his first green jacket, thus completing a career Grand Slam. Woods, who has confirmed he is ready to play at Augusta after spell working on his game, is one of only five players to win the Masters, The Open, the US PGA Championship and the US Open - and it's that success which led to a young McIlroy aiming to emulate him.

McIlroy played golf from a young age and always admired Woods as he grew up in Northern Ireland . McIlroy grew up watching Woods and is now on his way to emulating his hero . McIlroy revealed recently that he sent Tiger a letter saying he was 'coming to get' him . Rory's rise from child prodigy to the world's best - along with his fascination with Woods' stellar career - has now been beautifully told in a new two-minute video created by their sponsors Nike. Entitled 'Ripple', the clip features a number of young actors portraying McIlroy as a kid and into his teenage years - from hitting plastic balls around his parents' living room, to practising relentlessly in his hometown of Holywood, Northern Ireland. A common theme runs through the video as McIlroy and his father keep a close eye on Tiger's progress on both the PGA Tour and at the major championships. Speaking about 'Ripple', McIlroy said: 'As a kid, I looked up to Tiger. When I first saw him on TV, I remember being completely enamored by the energy he brought to the sport. His will to win. His determination. His fight.' McIlroy and Woods will line up at Augusta for the Masters this week but in contrasting form .

Fourteen years later at the 2000 PGA Championship, I got to play with and against him \u2013 someone I looked up to.' It remains to be seen whether Woods will be at the business end of the Masters come Sunday but McIlroy relishes playing with his idol. 'It's been an incredible journey for me, going from massive fan to competitor,' he added. 'To think that not too long ago I was that little boy watching him on TV to where I am now. 'It's been a cool journey and I'm very lucky I get to compete with and against him, because he inspired me as a kid and he inspires me now. He's the best player I've ever seen.'",

Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with his Thai girlfriend moments before his death. He is also understood to have clashed with a man who was seen talking to his girlfriend at a bar. The incidents happened in Hua Hin, a coastal town and beach resort 120 miles south-west of Bangkok. Tragic: Iain Mackay, 40, (pictured) is understood to have got into a fight at the Hua Hin resort, 125 miles south of Bangkok, after discovering the woman chatting with another man at a bar in the coastal city . Thai police said Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a shop near to the bar where he had spotted his girlfriend. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed. However, friends of Mr Mackay claim that he had clashed with another man who had been talking to his girlfriend moments before his death, the Press and Journal newspaper reported. Others said that Mr Mackay had posted links to his girlfriend\u2019s Facebook page before his death in which she was pictured with another man. One friend said: \u2018Iain was obviously upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.\u2019 Those close to Mr Mackay said he had been in a relationship with his girlfriend for several years. Mr Mackay, an underwater research specialist, is believed to have been employed by seismic research company Polarcus, which is based in Dubai. Location: The resort where Mr Mackay died is in Hua Hin (pictured) - a coastal city 125 miles south of Bangkok . Sources at the company confirmed that Mr Mackay was on leave from his vessel and had told colleagues that he planned to spend his time off in Thailand. Thai officials said that Mr Mackay had died at 3pm on Saturday but relatives claim that they were told of his death on Friday. The Foreign Office also confirmed that Mr Mackay had died on Friday. A spokesman said: \u2018We can confirm the death of a British national in Hua Hin, Thailand, on April 3. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.\u2019 Mr Mackay\u2019s death comes nine years after a British former public schoolboy was murdered after splitting with his Thai wife at the Hua Hin resort. Toby Charnaud, 41, was beaten to death with an iron bar and wooden staves by relatives of his ex-wife, Pannada Laoruang, in August 2006. Laoruang then helped them burn his body before chopping it up and scattering the remains. A Thai court at the time heard how Mr Charnaud, who was educated at Marlborough College, sold \u00a32.5million Latimer Manor estate near Chippenham, Wiltshire, after falling in love with 35-year-old Laoruang, whom he met in a Bangkok bar while on holiday. Last year British students Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao. Two Burmese men have been charged with their murder. Arguement: Mr Mackay bled to death after getting into a furious row at a bar in\u00a0Hua Hin city .",

His feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others. And observers were quick to point out that Abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in Australia. Abbott was in a Sydney pub on Saturday evening when a group of Australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them. The Prime Minister accepted and even gave a short, impromptu speech, one of the football coaches, Simon Carrodus, told The Australian Woman's Weekly. \"Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head. And he was proud as punch,\" Carrodus said. A schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint. Video of Abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants \"Skol! Skol!\" drew plenty of attention on social media. Some commentators focused on Abbott's drinking technique. But others suggested he was setting a bad example. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. \"Like most Australians, I enjoy a drink on social occasions,\" he said in January 2014. \"However, as a father and as a citizen, I'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent, especially at \"hot spots\" in our big cities.\" Casting those concerns aside, some social media users belittled Abbott's beer swilling. They said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds.",

Steve Tempest-Mitchell, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, lost a whopping 16st after the surgery 14 months ago, which caused his stomach to shrink to the size of a tennis ball. The 56-year-old said he decided to go through with the operation after hitting 32st and struggling to control his Type 2 diabetes. Scroll down for video . Slim and trim: Steve Tempest-Mitchell says he has a new lease of life after slimming down from 32st to 16st . 'It was a case of going in for the surgery and hoping to come out the other side,' said the father-of-three. This was a life changing and life threatening decision for me to make. 'At 32st, it was not an easy decision as I had been turned down for the surgery two and a half years previously . 'It had got to a point where something had to be done because I was slowly killing myself. I was just waiting for something awful to happen and even needed psychiatric help.' Although he never indulged in binge-eating, Mr Tempest-Mitchell says he would eat smaller portions at regular intervals and was drinking around eight cans of cola a day. But the former bomb disposal expert hadn't always been big and he says that growing up, he lived an active lifestyle, regularly playing rugby and competing in wrestling. Flashback: Mr Tempest-Mitchell said he was almost a recluse when he was at his biggest (above) As he got older, he began to struggle with his weight thanks to a lifestyle of long-haul flights, business meetings and boozy evenings spent entertaining clients. Mr Tempest-Mitchell also had to contend with some highly stressful situations while working as a bomb disposal expert between 1996 and 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he was employed as a contractor with the Ministry of Defence. Using high-pressure water technology, he would set about the grim task of defusing bombs. 'It was a very stressful situation,' he explains. 'Not only have you got to handle the situation of defusing the threat of the bomb but you are in dangerous territory as well under guard from soldiers. Helping hand: The former bomb disposal expert said he needed to be pushed in a wheelchair to board a plane . 'We were very lucky as one of the bases we were stationed at was attacked by a rocket launcher just weeks after we left.' Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who is now a business development manager at a demolition and asbestos removal firm, said as the years went by, his weight crept up. 'I had a very active lifestyle before my work and life balance was disrupted and I began to not have time to eat right,' he said. 'I was never one of those people who would eat massive amounts of food where you are stunned by the amount but I did have small portions regularly. 'Ever since I was a child, I always drank coke. At one point, I was having between six to eight cans a day. I have had to completely cut coke out of my life as well as other fizzy drinks. I don't mind if I never have one again.' The father-of-three said his weight affected his self confidence and esteem . As a result of the weight gain, Mr Tempest-Mitchell almost became housebound at his heaviest and was forced to plan every trip out. His weight issues even affected his working life, as well as his confidence and self esteem. 'I was forced to park the car as close as possible to wherever I was going, if I couldn't, I'd have to turn back and go home,' he recalls. 'I was almost becoming a recluse as I was unable to visit sites for my work so instead worked from home. I was becoming a burden on my family, especially when we tried to go on holiday. I had to be taken to the plane by a buggy or wheelchair.' Fed up, he took the plunge and opted for surgery - a decision that coincided with him finding that he was about to become a grandfather. Both of his daughters, aged 26 and 36, were expecting babies. 'My one daughter came to see me while I was recovering from the operation and broke the news that she was pregnant,' said Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who also has a 34-year-old son. Although he never indulged in eating too many snacks, he said he would drink up to eight cans of coke a day . 'I was so thrilled as I knew the success of the surgery would allow me to be more active and enjoy spending time with them as they are growing up.' As well as losing more than a stone a month, he has also seen his waist shrink from 66 inches to 42 inches and his chest go down from 66 inches to 48 inches. 'Now I feel like I am a new man,' he said. 'I have the energy to play with my grandchildren, who are both nearly one, which I would not have been able to do before.'",

Meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside. But are any of these high-tech suncreams worth buying? Here, Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, offers his verdict. And we rate them... A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra-red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside. Here, consultant dermatologist Bav Shergill gives his verdict . Dr Skin's Suncare Lotion And Sun Drink . \u00a311.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion, dr-skins.com . CLAIMS: SPF 30 suncream containing UVA and UVB protection, plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin E, lycopene, vitamin C, beta-carotene and other nutrients for skin health. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables. 'There's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage. 'The suncream is ok, but it's pretty standard.' 5/10 . Ladival Sun Protection, SPF 30 . \u00a319.99 for 150ml spray, from Boots and supermarkets . CLAIMS: First mainstream product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB. Also has antioxidants. Offers 'protection against four times more of the sun's rays'. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'The effects of infra-red A rays on the skin is an emerging field of research. 'A recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra-red A. 'I'd plump for Factor 50 rather than Factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent. 'You can get the same UVA and UVB protection from cheaper products.' 6/10 .

Goldfaden MD Sun Visor Oil Free Spray, SPF 30 . \u00a340 for 80ml, Space NK stores . CLAIMS: This protects against UVA/UVB rays - it contains titanium oxide, oxtinoxate, benzophenone and organic red tea extract. Developed by a U.S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure.

EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation. 'Children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing. 'Avocado oil is a good moisturiser, but it's not clear how it 'aids the development of the cutaneous barrier'. 'I'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well.' 7/10 . Actinica Lotion . \u00a319.99 for 80g, larger branches of Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacies and pharmacy2u.co.uk . CLAIMS: For the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients (e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system, such as transplant patients). Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells. 'Patients who've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use.' 8/10 . Wilko Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50 . \u00a32 for 50ml, from Wilko stores . CLAIMS: A UVA and UVB sunscreen. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This does what it says on the label. 'It has the same UVA and UVB protection ingredients as other more expensive creams, plus it is water resistant, and easily absorbed.' 9/10 . Actinica aims to\u00a0prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients while Calypso contains UVA and UVB protection, is water resistant and won't stain clothes . Sun Ceutic 50 Anti-Ageing Sun Protection SPF 50 . \u00a331 for 50ml, from uniqueskin.com . CLAIMS: This is said to prevent photo ageing (sun-induced skin damage) and sun spots and contains a 'powerful stem cell stimulator'; also contains hyaluronic acid, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and aloe vera. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'All Factor 50 suncreams with UVA and UVB protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots. 'Hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin, but there's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream.

EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This is OK for a school situation as children are mainly indoors. 'Suncream needs to be reapplied about every two hours if you are out in the sun because the creams get rubbed off - so this is not quite the once-a-day panacea you might anticipate.' 7/10 .",

An 18-month-old baby and three girls - aged three, six and eight - were trapped on a sandbank at Blackpool Beach while out walking during the school break. But when it was obvious they had found themselves in trouble, those perched on the nearby pier did nothing to help - instead, they took out their smartphones to record the drama. Two mothers saved the lives of three girls and a baby after the youngsters were trapped by the rising tide . The Mirror reported the two mothers held the baby and young girls' heads above the rising tide until volunteer lifeboats reached them. Lifeboat crew member Nathan Lee told the paper: 'They thought they were going to die. One mum was disgusted people were filming it all on cameras, not helping. 'A few more minutes and none of them would be here.' The incident serves as just another reminder of the dangers of rising tides after more than 60 spectators had to be rescued at the Boat Race in London on Saturday. Lifeboats were deployed to transport the onlookers from the shore after they became trapped on the edge of the River Thames. Video footage showed a group of at least 40 people stranded by the rising waters after watching the rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge universities. A boy, reportedly eight years old, was also rescued from an embankment after he became separated from his mother, while seven people were evacuated from Chiswick Eyot when they were cut off by the rising tide. The RNLI said it was a 'surprise' to find so many spectators in trouble and the number was 'significantly greater' than in previous years. Many were unaware that they would be exposed to the substantial wash from the flotilla following the races and from the rising tide, it said. As a result many were cut off and found themselves with limited options to reach higher ground. Chiswick RNLI station manager Wayne Bellamy said: 'This incident showed once more that the tidal Thames can catch people unaware.'

To accomplish this task, the cyber-bandits allegedly working for the Kremlin commandeered a State Department email account and sent a phishing email to someone at the White House designed to trick the recipient into downloading malicious software. Silver lining: White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said last year's cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information . Once downloaded onto a White House computer, the malware presumably allowed the hackers to penetrate the unclassified network containing Obama's schedule that is not accessible to the general public. According to an anonymous government official, the hackers have been able to re-enter the State Department computer system, despite efforts to keep them out. The Russian Embassy did not publicly comment on the hacking allegations . The White House responded to CNN\u2019s revelations by saying the report did not refer to a new incident but was \u2018speculating\u2019 about the source of cyber activities that were disclosed last year. Spokesman Mark Stroh said in a statement that the White House would not comment on CNN's attribution of the cyber-attack to Russian hackers. \u2018Any such activity is something we take very seriously. In this case, as we made clear at the time, we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity,\u2019 Stroh stated. \u2018As has been our position, we are not going to comment on the referenced article's attribution to specific actors.\u2019 White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said in an appearance on CNN Tuesday that the White House in 2014 disclosed cyber intrusions that did not affect classified information. \u2018We have an unclassified system and then we have a classified system, a top secret system,\u2019 Rhodes said. \u2018We do not believe that our classified systems were compromised.\u2019 But he said, \u2018There's always vulnerability.\u2019 For that reason, Rhodes said the White House operates a separate, secure system for classified data. He assured the public that the White House takes regular actions to prevent intrusions on its unclassified network.",

The vital findings have been suppressed for nearly four months, and have only emerged now after the Care Quality Commission quietly revised its report to rate many of the hospital's services as 'good'. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' and placed it in special measures, along with a dozen of the worst hospitals in the country. But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up by Labour Party activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation. The new version of the report rates the hospital as 'good' in 18 out of 33 criteria that were assessed including its outpatients departments and overall standard of end-of-life care. It also praises a number of the hospital's departments and individuals as 'outstanding' including its maternity ward, intensive care unit, specialist children's nurse in A&E and the chaplain. Crucially, the report \u2013 a draft of which has been leaked to the Mail \u2013 shows that the CQC ignored a second, far more positive spot check of the hospital when it published its initial report. In January \u2013 a week before the first report came out \u2013 inspectors returned to check up on two wards where they had raised concerns about standards of care during a visit in September. They found major improvements and praised nurses for treating patients with dignity and respect, responding promptly to call bells and ensuring patients were not in pain. Yet the watchdog ignored these findings when placing the hospital in special measures. Hinchingbrooke \u2013 which serves 160,000 patients in Huntingdon \u2013 was controlled by the private firm Circle from February 2012 until last month. NHS patients were treated there as usual but Circle \u2013 rather than NHS managers \u2013 was in charge of the day-to-day running of the hospital and its budget. The firm was praised for driving down waiting times, lowering the death rate, reducing infections and improving overall care. After January's report Circle announced it would be withdrawing from its contract. The hospital is now being run by the NHS Trust Development Authority. The rating of 'requires improvement' in the revised report moves the hospital from the bottom 13 per cent of hospital trusts in the country to an average score, which is achieved by 59 per cent of organisations. Today the watchdog will upgrade the 'inadequate' finding to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report . The Mail has repeatedly highlighted concerns by MPs and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation. One of the inspectors was a member of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. Another was a senior figure in the British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, who had previously spoken out about the dangers of private firms' involvement in the NHS. Neither took part in the spot checks a week before January's report. Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman said: 'This is an extraordinary procedure and raises serious questions about how the CQC goes about its inspections. 'It's an admission by the watchdog that its first inspection report was over the top and far too tough. It's all been heavily influenced by the public service unions. I will be writing to the Health Secretary to demand a full investigation into whether this was a stitch-up.' A spokesman for Circle said: 'This vindicates our view that the inspection of Hinchingbrooke was flawed. The evidence has always been that Hinchingbrooke was a good hospital, with low mortality rates, low waiting times, and positive reviews from other NHS regulators.'",

Bethany Farrell, 23, from Essex, died on February 17 while in Queensland's Whitsundays, a week into her dream gap-year when she went scuba diving for the first time. Two people who were on the boat when Ms Farrell died have taken to TripAdvisor to slam Wings Diving Adventures for the way they handled the tragic circumstances. While one of the reviews criticises the way people on the boat were treated amid the panic, a friend makes the shocking claim that photos of the backpacker shortly before she died were deleted. The backpacker's father is devastated that picture evidence, which may have been able to explain some of the mystery behind the drowning, was discarded before police could see it. British backpacker Bethany Farrell, 23, died on February 17 while scuba diving in Queensland's Whitsundays . 'There is no excuse,' Bethany's father Patrick Farrell, 47, told the Courier Mail. 'Grave mistakes have been made. Ultimately her life was in their hands. Now she\u2019s dead.' Ms Farrell drowned on her first ever scuba dive\u00a0after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year. She was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. A post mortem determined the cause of death was drowning. Last week a number of reviews from distressed fellow travellers - who were on the charter when Ms Farrell died - emerged, slamming the tour guides' handling of the situation and claiming photographs were deliberately deleted. 'What was supposed to be a dream trip turned into the worst possible nightmare,' one user wrote. The same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of Ms Farrell with others before the dive, but when they contacted Wings Diving Adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted. Scathing reviews have been posted to TripAdvisor slamming the\u00a0Wings Diving Adventures charter boat operators and claiming they deleted photographs of Ms Farrell . The young woman was just one week into gap year in Australia when she tragically drowned . Ms Farrell was on her first scuba diving trip when she tragically drowned near Blue Pearl Bay (pictured) 'We got in contact with wings solely because they had pictures their staff had taken of the three of us before the dive. Wings deleted these pictures to make way for pictures of their next trip.... despite the likelihood of the police wanting those pictures as evidence,' the review also read. 'Wings have made no effort in contacting our friend's family to express their condolences, we feel they are an absolute disgrace.' Another diver also on the same boat made similar claims, saying the people on the boat were left without any information for a number of hours after the incident which claimed Ms Farrell's life. 'The girl who had the accident was found dead, and what's worst is that I now know that they deleted all of the pictures that had been taken on the boat before they could give it to the girl's family or police,' another review claimed. 'This is destruction of evidence, and I want to make sure that Wings does not get away with this,' the traveller continued. This report was written by a distressed woman who was on the boat when Ms Farrell drowned. Wings refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia . Ms Farrell (not pictured)\u00a0was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay in the Whitsundays . When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Wings Diving Adventures declined to comment on the incident, or whether any photographs had been deleted. Queensland police said they could not comment on specific elements of the investigation. Ms Farrell's father said he was not going on a 'witch hunt' but was desperate to get the truth about his daughter's death and the photographs. 'I don\u2019t want to go on a witch hunt. But this will go to an inquest. We\u2019re heartbroken and will do anything to get to the truth,' he told the Courier Mail. The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death. Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell\u2019s mother Caron, said at the time: \u2018The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends. \u2018At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help. \u2018They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.\u2019 The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell\u2019s death are fully understood. Ms Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there. She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17. The case is still being investigated by Queensland Police, who will hand a report over to the coroner.",

Ballance's 122 was the mainstay of England's 333 for seven declared leaving West Indies needing an unlikely 438 to win the first Test. They finished the fourth day on 98 for two after another superb Chris Jordan slip catch made the breakthrough. Gary Ballance scored 122 as England took firm control of the first Test against the West Indies in Antigua . Ballance plays a sweep shot during his impressive innings at the\u00a0Sir Vivian Richards Stadium . Ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in Antigua . Ballance, who had a poor World Cup , said: 'It's been a tough winter but four bad innings don't make you a bad cricketer. I would like to think I was settled at number three after last summer. Scoring a hundred in a Test match is a great feeling. You have to enjoy doing well,' as his joyous century celebration indicated. Even with the ever-present Pietersen factor Ballance added: 'That's international sport, I haven't doubted my place. I knew I had done well before. I didn't come here thinking that I was going to get dropped. I was focused on scoring runs and to get a hundred is huge.' There needs to be an opening for KP to make a sensational England comeback. But there looks to be no room in the line-up for Pietersen. Ballance at number three followed by Ian Bell and Joe Root seems a rock solid middle order for the Ashes this summer, by when KP will be 35. Joe Root formed a solid partnership with Ballance and made big inroads against the home side . Root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day . Jordan's stunning one-handed catch off part-time bowler Joe Root to dismiss Darren Bravo was a critical moment . Ballance said: 'It was brilliant by CJ but he does it all the time. He's got unbelievable hands.' Ballance summed it up as\u00a0a 'very good day, pretty much perfect' adding: 'It would have been nice to get one or two more wickets but we're happy with that, to get two this evening puts a lot of pressure on them.' West Indies coach Phil Simmons said: 'We're still looking to win the game. The first hour is vital for both sides. We wanted to be around 100 for one at the close.",

(Chatto & Windus \u00a316.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker\u2019s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our \u2018historic relationship with aviation\u2019. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights \u2014 exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia\u2019s great blue heron as \u2018the 747 of the swamp\u2019 and notes how this would delight the aircraft\u2019s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more \u2018a place\u2019 than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the \u2018frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better \u2014 everything looks better \u2014 when your feet are warm\u2019. He writes elegantly about his pilot\u2019s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth\u2019s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And \u2018meet\u2019 really means \u2018meet\u2019: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, \u2018our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.\u2019 Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there\u2019s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as \u2018Klingons\u2019. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as \u2018the heavy\u2019, one acting as \u2018heavy out\u2019, the other as \u2018heavy home\u2019. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker\u2019s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region\u2019s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city\u2019s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker\u2019s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics\u2019 singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls.",

Philippe Coutinho eventually broke the deadlock after 161 goalless minutes across the two games but Blackburn came close to levelling matters when goalkeeper Simon Eastwood was denied in stoppage time. Sportsmail's Oliver Todd rated the player's performances at Ewood Park. BLACKBURN ROVERS: (4-4-2) Eastwood 7 . Could do nothing to stop Philippe Coutinho's winner but did well to deny Brazilian in the first half and even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time. Simon\u00a0even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time after performing well in goal . Henley 7 . Solid at right back, he kept Raheem Sterling quieter than most full backs in the Barclays Premier League would. Restricted in going forward as he kept an eye on England star. Baptiste 8 . So often found in the way of Liverpool's shots, even though he was suffering with a hamstring injury. Performed heroics at the back but couldn't quite hold out before being substituted. Kilgallon 8 . Another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge he faced from Daniel Sturridge and mainly restricted the England striker to potshots from range. Matt Kilgallon was another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge of Daniel Sturridge . Olsson 7 . Could have gone down when under pressure inside the Liverpool area but his honesty was his own enemy. Solid at the back. Conway 6.5 . Industrious down the right but often restricted as he looked to double up on dangerous Sterling. Corry Evans is no stranger to a challenge, and he put himself about in midfield, replacing Jay Spearing . Evans 6.5 . No stranger to a challenge, put himself about in midfield after replacing cup-tied Jay Spearing. Booked for desperate challenge on Sterling. Williamson 7 . Tracked back really well and did his best to neutralise the threat of Coutinho. Could have given away a penalty in stoppage time for challenge on Joe Allen but referee made right decision. Marshall 7 . Creative force. Provided the ammo for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they looked to take advantage of an unfamiliar back-line. Unlucky to be denied by Simon Mignolet. Ben Marshall was unlucky to be denied when his header was saved by Simon Mignolet in the second half . Cairney 6.5 . Anonymous at times but then tested Mignolet from range as Rovers grew into the game early in the second half. Rhodes 6.5 . Subdued upfront and looked a poor replacement for Gestede who had impressed at Anfield. Missed with key header in the first half. Subs . Gestede 6.5 (for\u00a0Conway 64) Came on to energise Blackburn as Liverpool took control but aside from one chance he showed a lack of match fitness, struggling with a hamstring problem. Spurr (for Baptiste\u00a079) No time to make an impact but kept things together well. Rudy Gestede came on to energise Blackburn but aside from one chance he showed a lack of match fitness . LIVERPOOL: (4-2-3-1) Mignolet 7.5 . Recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Save from Marshall on to the post in key moment. Simon Mignolet recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Saved from Marshall in key moment . Johnson 6 . Played on the right of a back four. Natural role for him and found chances to go forward but left gaps at times. Sakho 5.5 . Struggled from the start, looking uncomfortable on the ball and he picked up a hamstring problem. Substituted after losing out to Rhodes. Lovren 6.5 . Good return to the side, albeit against lower league opposition. Team selection on Saturday indicated he was fifth choice but Anfield career not necessarily over. Moreno 6 . Comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do. Alberto Moreno had a comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do . Lucas 6 . Provided a solid base in midfield and moved the ball around well but not much penetration as Liverpool toiled in first half. Allen 5.5 . Similar to Lucas, couldn't provide impetus where it was needed, though. May have handled in own area and later appeared to go down easily for late penalty shout. Coutinho 8 . The star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley. Clever move to find way to break Blackburn down. Philippe Coutinho was the star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley . Henderson 6.5 . His one-two with Coutinho set up the winner but his deliveries from dead-balls left much to be required at times. Sterling 6.5 . One of Liverpool's main threats as usual, playing down the left at Ewood Park. Impact blunted as Blackburn doubled up. Booked. Sturridge 5 . He's not back at his best yet and it showed. Seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times and was restricted to shots from distance. Daniel Sturridge is not back at his best yet and it showed. He seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times . Subs . Toure 7.5 (for Sakho 26) Solid in defence with Lovren, he ably deputised when Liverpool had to reshuffle early on and dealt with Gestede and Rhodes. Lambert (for Sturridge 85) No time. Headed first touch wide. REFEREE: . Kevin Friend 7 . Did all that could be expected of him. Missed Allen handball shout after Ben Marshall's header but that would have been harsh. Ignored penalty shout from same player in stoppage time. MAN OF THE MATCH: . Philippe Coutinho . A mercurial performance topped off with an excellent goal to decide the game. He knows how to make the difference in big moments for his club and Liverpool benefited from that again. Coutinho's shot finds the corner to decide the game at Ewood Park after a lack of clear-cut chances .",

A Silicon Valley-based start-up is offering an at-home DNA saliva test to detect the same gene mutations priced at just $249 (\u00a3167).\u00a0It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 . It tests for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, along with 17 other markers, all of which are linked to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Women with a mutation in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of up to 80 percent for developing breast cancer and up to a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer. The company behind the test, Color Genomics, was founded by Elad Gil, a former cancer researcher at MIT and Otman Laraki, a former engineer at Twitter and Google. 'We founded Color because we want to give every person the opportunity to understand their genetic risk of cancer,' said Dr Gil. Angelina Jolie recently said that the cost of testing for breast cancer genes 'remains an obstacle for many women'. The actress, who is pictured here with her husband Brad Pitt, was referring to a genetic test that currently costs more than $3,000 (\u00a32,000) 'This important information gives people the opportunity to work with their physician to manage their risk and make key life choice.' To get hold of the test, a physician will need to order it online, with the patient receiving a kit at home. The kit has instructions on how to take a sample of saliva and send it back to a central lab for processing. 'We want to make sure that there is always a physician involved,' the founders told Quartz. Color Genomics is currently available in 45 states and is hoping to comply with regulations required in New York, Maryland, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Florida. However, the test has received mixed responses with some saying it might not be useful, and could even be harmful. 'I worry it will give women information that we really don't know what it means - and that women will make very difficult choices that turn out to be incorrect,' Frances Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition told NPR. 'If we have more women who believe they are at increased risk,' Visco says, 'we will have more women removing healthy body parts. 'We really do not have enough information to base this kind of expansion of this kind of testing.' Color Genomics did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com for comment. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen . Just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease, a study has found. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer. Most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow, and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells. This means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. As part of the study, Swedish and British researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients, in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago. They found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen, and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day, had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all.",

At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety. Win on Saturday and they will be out of the relegation zone. For Nigel Pearson and his men, their season starts now. When you\u2019re facing relegation you are supposed to be dispirited and lacking in confidence. So how on earth have Leicester won three on the bounce? Only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can better that as a winning streak. Leicester players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the Premier League . It has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for. Leicester were bottom on Christmas Day but win at Burnley and they will give themselves a real chance of staying up \u2014 something only two sides have managed after being bottom at Christmas. It\u2019s not just Leicester, though. The other promoted clubs \u2014 QPR and Burnley \u2014 have shown fantastic spirit. I have been in relegation battles and seen teams with less fight in them than these three. QPR earned a fantastic win at West Brom, were unlucky to draw at Aston Villa and battled manfully against Chelsea. Burnley might be on a poor run but you know Sean Dyche\u2019s side will battle until the bitter end. So how does a manager create a positive attitude when things look so bad? What you can\u2019t afford to do is let players sit and study the fixtures and start looking at how many points they need. If they are too busy working out the permutations, they\u2019re not concentrating on their game. Leicester face a crunch clash with fellow relegation battlers Burnley on Saturday . If a player is not being pushed it\u2019s easy for them to shift responsibility and hope somebody else gets them over the line. The best thing to do is keep them busy. If you\u2019re working hard on the training ground looking at team shape, developing players and preparing for games, you are making much better use of your time. I\u2019ve been in that situation as a player and the worst thing you can do is to wrap them in cotton wool. There is a tendency to try to protect people in case things go wrong. Training eases up because of injury fears and managers try to keep their players fresh. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has managed to create a positive attitude in his squad . But that leaves you sitting around with your thoughts and that can be dangerous. There needs to be mental stimulation \u2014 you can\u2019t sit around and wallow in self-pity. At this stage of the season a week can be a long time between games. Pearson and his players will be absolutely buzzing in training and it\u2019s important to take that energy and intensity into games. It annoys me when managers say it\u2019s all about results. The only way to win is to make sure that your performance is right and that comes from hard work during the week. Pearson has worked hard to make sure Leicester\u2019s destiny is in their own hands. Their form has struck fear into other teams. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring in the 2-0 victory against Swansea . The three promoted sides look brave enough to go out and play, but Sunderland and Hull look paralysed by fear. Steve Bruce thinks Hull\u2019s home form will keep them up but a look at the fixtures shows it won\u2019t be that easy. Leicester, QPR and Burnley have all given their home fans reason to cheer with their efforts and the thrill of the chase means everything is applauded. Contrast that with the toxic feeling at the Stadium of Light. Leicester have taken a long time to wake up but they have rekindled the atmosphere they had when they beat Manchester United. And with four of their last six games at home, they need to keep that up. If they can, and the level of their performance continues to harness the positivity of that home crowd, don\u2019t bet against them making the great escape. Fans still believe that Leicester can still avoid the drop from the Premier League .",

But while we're all well aware of the presence of dust mites lingering in every corner of our house, little do we know just how prevalent they are and how detrimental they are to our health. New research has shown that the average Australian sheds the equivalent of a 50 gram packet of chips every week in dry skin, feeding an army of dust mites into our couches and beds. Sleeping soundly? An army of dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions . What lies in your bed? The oddly-shaped dust mites live for three to four months and live off human and animal skin . Dust mites are the number one cause of allergies in Australian homes and may be the reason why you have a runny nose or watery eyes. The odd shaped critters increase two to three fold during late autumn to winter leading thousands of Australians to suffer from common cold or flu-like symptoms. Putting it into  perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just one metre square of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime. They live for three to four months and feed off animal and human dead skin. Disgustingly, dust mites use your bed as their incubator and thrive off the warm conditions. Where you lay your head: An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions, but their droppings . An average bed can have approximately 10,000 dust mites living in it at one time, however it's not the dust mites that cause nasty allergic reactions but their droppings. Considering the average Australian breathes 22,000 times a day, draws 12,000 litres of air into their lungs each day and spends 90 per cent of their time indoors, dust mites are a huge problem when it comes to keeping healthy in the colder months. Influenza . Viral respiratory illnesses . Common colds / flu . The revelation comes after experts recently proclaimed that the majority of people aren't doing enough to ensure that their sheets are clean and hygienic. New research by Yahoo, which polled\u00a01,187 readers on their sheet-washing habits,\u00a0indicates that just 44 per cent of women wash their sheets on a weekly basis - however scientists recommend a weekly wash as the minimum needed to ensure a totally bacteria-free environment. According to Dr Philip Tierno, Jr., the director of clinical microbiology and immunology at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, after just one night of use, your bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of dead skin, bacteria, fungus, mites, and even faeces. The harsh reality: Putting it into perspective, more than 1,000 dust mites live in just 1m2 of carpet and they produce approximately 2000 droppings in their lifetime . Research suggests that each and every time you use your bed, you are depositing more dead skin, in addition to any dirt, sweat or grease that may have also built up on your skin throughout the day. And then there are the cosmetic products that you use on your body, each of which deposits its own trace amount of product on the bed every time you get into it. And it's not just your sheets that you need to worry about. In 2013, research by UK-based mattress company Ergoflex determined that going one week without washing your pyjamas could make you susceptible to developing MRSA, cystitis, and a host of other skin infections. According to Dr Penny Adams, a general practitioner in the Sydney suburb of Manly, there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them. 'It sounds gross there\u2019s a packet of crisps in your bed but there are a lot of measures you can take to decrease dust mites,' she said. 'You can remove carpets and wet mop hard surfaces, you can vacuum with a filter and use allergy protective covers on the mattresses. Talk to the experts: Dr Penny Adams (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia\u00a0there is just no way of avoiding the dirty mites but there are ways of managing them . 'If you\u2019re allergic to dust mites you basically can\u2019t avoid them, they're everywhere' Dr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. While she said there is no evidence that anything can be done to rid our houses of dust mites, she revealed to Daily Mail Australia that using a vacuum with a HEPA filter can help. 'The National Asthma Council of Australia recommends regular vacuuming of carpets and soft furnishings\u2019 or the removal of carpets in favour of hard floors,' she said. 'Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure all bacteria is captured within the vacuum, rather than sprayed back into the air' Dr Adams also said that a humidifier can assist with reducing the effects of respiratory viruses such as a cold or flu and allergy sufferers. For allergy sufferers, high concentration of dry air can often lead to breathing problems as well as increase the body\u2019s susceptibility to illnesses such as: chapped lips, dry and dehydrated skin, blocked sinuses and even more regular nosebleeds. 'We know that cold and flu viruses are more prevalent if you have lower temperatures and the humidity is too low,' she said. 'People often ask me: \"Should I get a humidifier?\".' 'There is no evidence that humidifiers actually cure or shorten the flu. They\u2019re not a treatment for the flu however they can make you feel more comfortable symptomatically.' Dr Adams said she was surprised at the statistic that Australians spend 90 per cent of their time indoors but admitted that in the winter months people are susceptible to illnesses due to spending more time at home. 'In winter we spend more time at home than we do in summer months therefore allergy sufferers come into closer and more regular contact with allergens such as dust mites and pet hair,' she said. Dr Adams also said people can succumb to a cold or flu by being in close contact with, or by touching the unwashed hands of someone suffering from the virus. The top winter allergies to look out for are the influenza, viral respiratory illnesses and the common cold or flu. Weakness . fatigue . Wheezing . Runny nose . Coughing . Fever . Vaccinate . Wash your hands . Use tissues not hankies . Use a\u00a0humidifier . Get lots of rest . Stock up on fluids . Use over the counter medication . Symptoms can include weakness and fatigue, wheezing, a runny nose, coughing and fever. While you may do everything you can to dodge the cold or flu virus, once you have it there are measures that can be taken to kick it to the curb. 'Get lots of rest and stock up on fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration,' Dr Adams said. 'Symptoms of respiratory viruses can be treated with over the counter medication such as Panadol and Nurofen. Adults and children over the age of five can try taking cold and flu medication however, this is not recommended for children younger than six years old.' However she said respiratory illnesses can't be cured with antibiotics. The only exception to this is the influenza, which can be treated with anti-viral medication. Dr Adams said washing hands is extremely important once you contract the flu virus. Distrubing fact: The average Australian shed the equivalent of a 50g packet of chips in dead skin every week, most of it ending up in our beds . 'Wash and dry hands thoroughly and regularly to avoid contamination,' she said. And while it may be nice to have your dog or cat sleeping in your bed, this is one of the main causes of allergy and respiratory infections. 'Dog hair makes your nose tickle but that\u2019s not why you\u2019re sneezing,' Dr Adams said. 'It\u2019s because your dog\u2019s hair has allergens on it \u2013 left from your dog licking itself clean and proteins secreted by oil glands. 'Household allergens cling to it too \u2013 forming a kind of sneeze induced cocktail. Pets then shed hair around the home, distributing allergens and causing problems for allergy sufferers.' Pet owners should therefore vacuum regularly to protect their home and families from allergens. Dr Penny Adams recommends Dyson's first ever humidifier to relieve symptoms of dry air and their v6 vacuum cleaner, which has a HEPA filter included to capture allergens and dust mites.",

Nico Rosberg was brooding, his face stony, his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger. He was sitting next to Lewis Hamilton \u2014 as close as the German had got to his Mercedes team-mate all afternoon of the Chinese Grand Prix \u2014 at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations. Rosberg, whose usual coiffured, Euro-chic sheen had vanished, alleged that Hamilton had selfishly tried to spoil his race. The record states that Hamilton won, Rosberg was second and Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel third. But Rosberg feared he might be overtaken by Vettel before the second round of pit stops when Hamilton, then leading from pole position, slowed down a few fractions of a second \u2014 to conserve his tyres, he said.

Rosberg asked the team to get Hamilton to speed up, an instruction they issued and one with which the Briton complied. \u2018I wasn\u2019t controlling his race; I was controlling my own race,\u2019 said Hamilton, indignantly. \u2018I had no real threat from Nico.\u2019 But Rosberg said: \u2018It\u2019s interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace. That opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me.\u2019 Hamilton countered: \u2018My job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up.\u2019 Boys, boys. It took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public. We are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out. It was easy to sympathise with Rosberg but difficult to agree with him. Even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends, he must be reaching his wits\u2019 end, frustrated to distraction, wondering how on earth he can possibly beat Hamilton when he is on form. It seems, to this cod psychologist, that it was Rosberg\u2019s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race. \u2018We have first and second,\u2019 said the three-time world champion. Hamilton salutes the crowd as he makes his way on to the podium to collect his trophy for winning the Chinese Grand Prix .

Hamilton is covered in champagne by Rosberg as the Mercedes pair celebrate a one-two finish . \u2018I don\u2019t care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel is only third. One thing is clear: Lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end. There\u2019s nothing more to say. True, Lewis will drive selfishly. These guys are egocentric b******s. It is the only way to win the championship, and Nico is the same if the s*** hits the fan. Lewis was better this weekend. \u2018There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that\u2019s it.\u2019 For Hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track, the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season, ending up in a gravel trap, his championship hopes devastated in 2007. He again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear Max Verstappen\u2019s crippled Toro Rosso. The safety car came out. Anti-climax though it was, a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for Hamilton. He was congratulated over the radio for having \u2018the full house\u2019: pole, fastest lap and race win. It was a flawless performance. The race posed many tantalising questions. The first was whether Ferrari could match Mercedes in the temperate Shanghai climate, as they managed in Malaysia a fortnight ago? They were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook Rosberg. They will keep Mercedes on their toes, and that is balm for the sport. Hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate Hamilton at the third consecutive race . Hamilton, who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year\u2019s title, made the perfect start. He inclined his car right on the grid, covering Rosberg next to him, before darting through the first, right-hand corner in front. Contest over before it started. An honourable mention for 17-year-old Verstappen, who drove his Toro Rosso with great elan. He put his car down the inside of Marcus Ericsson\u2019s Sauber, causing Max\u2019s father and former racer Jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage. He then applauded in admiration. Alas, Verstappen\u2019s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight. Red Bull\u2019s woes continued with Daniil Kvyat\u2019s Renault engine billowing grey smoke into the Shanghai air. Their other car, driven by Daniel Ricciardo, was ninth. McLaren were even less successful than Red Bull, again. Jenson Button was demoted a place to 14th, having collided with Pastor Maldonado\u2019s Lotus. Button\u2019s team-mate Fernando Alonso was 12th after being lapped by Vettel, his replacement at Ferrari. Vettel was smiling afterwards, but not as widely as Hamilton. Max Verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes, but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired . Jenson Button, who finished 13th, was involved in a collision with Pastor Maldonado towards the end of the race .",

These vintage posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience, passengers wore their best clothes and there was plenty of legroom. They\u2019re featured in a new coffee table book, Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975, which revisits a time when the skies were dominated by the likes of Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) and Continental. Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda\u2019s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in\u00a0Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist . British Overseas Airways Corp led to the creation of British Airways (left) while Continental merged with United Airlines' parent company . It was a time when it cost an incredible amount of money to purchase a ticket for a commercial flight, with many of the ads promoting transatlantic or transpacific travel. The adverts created for the biggest airlines of the day, including many which no longer exist, offer a glimpse at how air travel, advertising and society changed over the 30-year period covered in the book. From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart . The book hails the designers' creative genius and uses special techniques to replicate their work as accurately as possible . In addition to drawings the adverts include photos of natural beauty spots, including Sydney Harbour (left) and Bermuda's beaches (right) Mr Huhne\u2019s book hails their creative genius and uses 17 colours, five types of varnishes and two methods of foil printing and embossing to replicate their work as accurately as possible. Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 was published by Berlin-based Callisto Publishers, which offered this synopsis of the tome: \u2018It provides unique insight into the design and advertising methods of an era when airlines were considered the most glamorous business sector and quality was the main criterion for selecting a flight.\u2019 It retails from approximately \u00a3270 online in the UK and from $250 online in the US.",

For the first time in 100 years, Cadbury's is set to release a super bar containing seven different fillings . But don't get too excited as there are only 50 on offer. And what's more, you won't find them in your corner shop or local supermarket as the bars were created for a competition. The Cadbury team worked alongside food artist Prudence Staite to create the bar in in a bid to get chocolate lovers to try something new. The brand had conducted research which showed that Britons can be hesitant to try new flavours and created the bar which includes their seven 'core flavours.' The Dairy Milk Spectacular will contain one row each of: Dairy Milk Caramel, Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut, Dairy Milk Whole Nut, Dairy Milk Oreo, Dairy Milk Daim, and Dairy Milk Turkish . Their study revealed we are more likely to try new flavours based on the recommendation of  loved ones \u2013 partners (36 per cent), family (25 per cent) or a close friend (24 per cent). Matthew Williams, Marketing Director for Cadbury said: 'The special edition Cadbury Dairy Milk Spectacular 7 bar is our first chocolate treat to contain seven flavours.

Annegret Raunigk, 65, was plunged into a vortex of travel and trials thanks to the wish of daughter Leila, who turns ten this year, but says she is not bothered about what people say about her decision to have more children so late in life. Their scheduled births for the schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin,\u00a0is just weeks away - but there are major fears that the health risks for her unborn quads will spike massively if they are induced early. Babies on the way: Annegret Raunigk, 65, and her nine-year-old daughter Leila are seen during a recent ultrasound filmed for an upcoming documentary about how the teacher is preparing to welcome the quads . Annegret, meanwhile, is weathering the debate centred on the rights or wrongs of her decision to both become pregnant and raise the children with cool detachment. 'There will obviously be cliches bandied about,' she said, 'and I find that quite strenuous. But I have always been a person who says live and let live and it is not for the opinion of others but for me. 'I have enough experience of childbirth not to be afraid. I am not scared actually, I am just hoping to stay healthy and fit. If others are mega-prim about this I believe they have no interesting lives themselves and therefore it no longer bothers me. I think this is the right choice.' 'She is a very strong, very fit woman,' Her doctor, Kai Hertwig tells MailOnline. 'I hope she can come to full term, I think she can. She is very well placed to be a fit mother for these babies. The schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin, is set to become the world's oldest woman to give birth to quads . Ms Raunigk and her large brood are seen during an appearance on German television in 2005 . 'The pregnancy so far makes no distinction between the body of a younger or older person but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high burden. 'We of course are keeping a close watch on the cardiovascular system. We all have little or no experience with such a pregnant woman in this age group, but I can say that this is certainly going very well.' Thrombosis, her heart, her circulatory system - these are the areas causing concern for the unborns in the run-up to delivery day. 'But she is highly motivated and this positive psychological mood is optimally important, the rest is not in our hands,' added her gynaecologist. Both were speaking in a clip released by the RTL TV network which is airing her story on Monday night. One woman who had a child at 42 tells the programme: 'I met her and found her to be a very sympathetic and intelligent woman. 'As a 56-year-old woman who raised a just-pubescent son, it is hard to imagine why she would want to have quads. I also wonder how she can meet the needs of her growing children, especially as the children will have no father.' It was mentioned in the publicity clip released by RTL that her fertility treatment - including both donated eggs and donated sperm - would never have been greenlighted in Germany. Two countries where treatment for women of such an advanced age is allowed were stated as Ukraine and America. All her 13 children, ranging from Leila to a daughter of 44, were sired by five different fathers.",

But there is another form of the deadly gas, dubbed abiotic methane, that is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor. Now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor . The reservoirs are secure, and scientists don't believe they will impact climate change. Instead, they say similar formations could someday be used to store methane, that can later be used as fuel. One reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge, in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'This ultraslow spreading ridge shows that the Arctic environment is ideal for this type of methane production,' said Joel Johnson associate professor at the University of New Hampshire. The Center for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Climate and Environment (Cage) estimates that up to 15,000 gigatonnes of carbon may be stored in the form of hydrates in the ocean floor. Scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane \u2013 a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide.\u00a0One such reservoir was recently discovered on the ultraslow spreading Knipovich ridge (pictured), in the deep Fram Strait of the Arctic Ocean. 'But this estimate is not accounting for abiotic methane. So there is probably much more,' said Cage director J\u00fcrgen Mienert. Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. However, methane is also the principle component in natural gas.\u00a0It is a lucrative fuel source, which could contain more energy than all the world's oil, coal and gas put together. They believe the gas forms through a process called serpentinisation. 'Serpentinisation occurs when seawater reacts with hot mantle rocks exhumed along large faults within the seafloor,' said Johnson. 'These only form in slow to ultraslow spreading seafloor crust. The optimal temperature range for serpentinisation of ocean crust is 200 \u2013 350 degrees Celsius.' Methane produced by serpentinisation can escape through cracks and faults, and end up at the ocean floor, causing a concern for future global warming. But in the Knipovich Ridge it is trapped as gas hydrate in the sediments. 'In other known settings the abiotic methane escapes into the ocean, where it potentially influences ocean chemistry,' says Johnson. 'But if the pressure is high enough, and the subsea floor temperature is cold enough, the gas gets trapped in a hydrate structure below the sea floor.' B\u00fcnz says that there are many places in the Arctic Ocean with a similar tectonic setting as the Knipovich ridge. Rather than causing a concern, the study claims that active tectonic environments may serve as a stable area for long-term storage of methane carbon in deep-marine sediments. But other types of methane in the Arctic are causing a concern for scientists. Last year Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He tweeted: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane \u2013 which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Samples of the gas hydrates will provide more knowledge on abiotic methane. But they need to be drilled, as they are 140 metres under the ocean floor .",

Thanks to workplace discrimination, he claims, he has been forced to go it alone and is now planning to set up his own business. Mr Whelan, who officially changed his name to King of Inkland King Body Art The Extreme Ink-ite but goes by Body Art for short, has covered every inch of his body in elaborate inkings. Discrimination: Mr Body Art says prejudice against people with body modifications has affected his career . 'I've got my face covered in tattoos, I've got various animals and I've got a giant snake on top of my head,' he explains. 'My eyeballs are stained, it's also known as an eyeball tattoo. I've got pirates on me, aliens on me and I've got a blue penis. My penis is blue.' He also had his nipples cut off six months ago in a bid to provide himself with a smoother canvas and keeps the discarded body parts in his freezer 'next to my sprouts'. For all that though, Mr Body Art says employers should take him seriously and look beyond his personal appearance to what's inside. 'I personally find it really difficult to get my head around it because there are companies out there that employ people on merit,' he fumes. Legal: Mr Body Art shows off a passport emblazoned with his unusual self-chosen name . Official: Letters arrive addressed to\u00a0King of Inkland King Body Art The Extreme Ink-ite - Body Art for short . 'There are [body] modified friendly companies. But the majority are like: \"Look at these people! You look different from everyone in our office. You're different. You don't fit our criteria. We're not employing you.\" That's frustrating.' Now Mr Body Art is planning to solve the problem by striking out on his own and has begun making preparations for his new career by attending business seminars in his home city. His spare time is being spent helping the local branch of the Liberal Democrats campaign ahead of the election, although he admits that people often wish to talk about his body modifications rather than Lib Dem policies. 'Dealing with people shouldn't be a challenge,' he adds. 'Is that right? No, it's not. It's a blatant form of discrimination. Blank canvas: Mr Body Art shows off his nipples - they were removed to give him a smoother canvas . Covered: Mr Body Art's \u00a340,000 tattoo collection covers him, quite literally, from head to toe . Striking out: Mr Body Art, seen here at a business conference, plans to set up a company of his own . 'I'm not after sympathy of any kind. Most modified people aren't. I'd just like to be given a chance.' Mr Body Art, who appears on a Channel 5 documentary entitled 2,000 Tattoos, 40 Piercings and a Pickled Ear tonight, hasn't always had the acceptance he craves - even within his own family. His father Patrick has found his son's penchant for inking particularly hard to come to terms with and worries it might frustrate his plans for business success. 'I've never understood it and he knows I've never understood it,' he says. 'I can't come to terms with it. But I've accepted it. 'I'm not happy with it. I'd love him to be the son that I knew but he has chosen his own way of life.' Mr Whelan Sr says he finds his son's name change particularly hard to accept and wants to continue calling him Matthew as he always has. Mr Body Art, however, has different ideas. 'I legally changed [my name], I abandoned [the old one] and I've got a new name so call me by that,' he insists. 'We don't really talk about my tattoos but when it does crop up, it can get passionate,' adds Mr Body Art. 'But I believe in my tattoos. I am who I am.'",

One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette\u00a0reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher \u2013 you can\u2019t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.' It is not known at this time as to the nationality or the exact actions of the two passengers arrested . A spokesperson for Thomson Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by passengers on board flight TOM022 from London Gatwick Airport to Cancun, which diverted to Bermuda yesterday due to a customer incident on board. 'We operate a zero tolerance policy in relation to any disruptive behaviour. The passengers in question were removed from the aircraft and met by police. 'The flight departed within two hours to ensure the other customers could get away on their holiday as soon as possible. 'Customer safety is our priority at all times and we would like to reassure passengers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'",

Manuel Pellegrini's side were given a torrid time by Crystal Palace on Monday night, as their Premier League title hopes were all but dashed and a place in the top two is all they have left to fight for. The City captain admits that the derby game is crucial and believes being the underdogs suits his side. Vincent Kompany (left) believes that a win against rivals Manchester United will help rectify their season . Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure after a disappointing season and could be replaced in the summer . He said: 'A derby is a derby. It doesn't matter what place you are in the league, it's a derby. If anything, it's a good moment to go into a derby. I guess the momentum is a little bit with our neighbours at the moment, but it's the perfect place for us to go and try to rectify what we've had.' With speculation surrounding their manager Pellegrini, it remains to be seen if he'll still be in charge in the summer but Kompany says that a strong finish will be key for them next season. 'My only concern is we get back to our best form,' he added. 'I think it's our general form that we have to improve. I've learnt from the past seasons as well that finishing a season strongly can have an impact on your next season as well. In some funny way, it wasn't even a bad game [against Palace]. Glenn Murray terrorised the Manchester City defence and opened the scoring despite being offside . Kompany and his team-mates talk to referee Michael Oliver after the clearly offside goal was awarded . 'We are demanding with ourselves because we have to win, but you guys saw it. Did they have a shot on goal except for set-pieces? They are definitely a solid team. They are definitely a team who knows how to defend. 'They had a game plan so credit to them but, for us, it wasn't a bad game in comparison with other games that we might have lost. It has a bit of a different feel to it maybe than the result at Burnley. But a team like us needs results.'",

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the deal Wednesday, saying the thermal-imaging company earned more than $7 million in profits from sales influenced by the gifts. The commission said two employees in FLIR's Dubai office gave luxury watches to five officials with the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Interior in 2009. The company also arranged travel for Saudi officials, including a 20-night trip with stops in Beirut, Casablanca, Dubai, New York and Paris. Investigation: FLIR Systems Inc. has agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle bribery charges filed by the SEC that involved expensive trips and gifts given to Middle Eastern government officials . 'FLIR's deficient financial controls failed to identify and stop the activities of employees who served as de facto travel agents for influential foreign officials to travel around the world on the company's dime,' said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit. The SEC said in a news release that FLIR reported the misconduct and cooperated with the investigation. Officials with the Wilsonville-based company echoed those remarks. 'The actions of the former employees involved do not reflect the values of FLIR or the high standards to which we hold ourselves accountable,' FLIR CEO Andy Teich said in a statement. The two former sales employees, Stephen Timms and Yasser Ramahi, agreed in November to settle SEC charges against them and pay financial penalties. The Securities and Exchange Commission (pictured) announced the deal Wednesday, saying the thermal-imaging company earned more than $7 million in profits from sales influenced by the gifts . FLIR got a multimillion-dollar contract to provide thermal binoculars to the Saudi government in November 2008.  Timms and Ramahi were responsible for the contract. They also negotiated sales of FLIR's security cameras to the same government officials. The SEC said Timms and Ramahi had Foreign Corrupt Practices Act training and were specifically told that luxury watches and vacations were prohibited gifts. The men falsified records in an attempt to conceal their behavior, the SEC found. Besides paying $9.5 million, FLIR must report to the SEC on its efforts to comply with the corrupt practices law for two years.",

But a survey of workers has also revealed working for government departments - long considered an easy ride - are among the jobs people would most like to have. The Department of Immigration ranked third in the survey, while the\u00a0Department of Defence and the Department of Health were also named in the top ten places Australians would like to work. Virgin, the second-largest airline in the country, was reportedly handed the accolade for its \u2018pleasant working atmosphere, a good work-life balance and strong management\u2019. Richard Branson's Virgin Airline is the place most Australians want to work for, according to a new survey . Desk jobs in government departments highly ranked in Australia\u2019s Most Attractive Employer awards . More than 50 per cent of participants in a study of 12,000 appeared to want to work for boss Richard Branson. Coming second in the survey of Australia\u2019s Most Attractive Employer is national public broadcaster the ABC \u2013 confirming a TV career is still high on the list of many people\u2019s dream jobs. And named in third place Thursday was the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, headed up by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Other Australians named the ABC as the place they would most like to work, alongside journalist Leigh Sales . Fourth and fifth place at the Randstad Awards were also airline and TV jobs, with the Seven Network and Qantas named respectively. People were asked which companies they had heard of, just how much they would like to work there and why they would like to work there. Frank Ribuot, CEO of Randstad Australia, said: \u2018The Virgin brand is widely recognised around the world and by people from all walks of life.

They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system.

Trott, who looks sure to open with Alastair Cook in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday, fell for just two, top-edging an attempted pull against a St Kitts side bolstered by England bowlers Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood. It follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his England team-mate Jimmy Anderson but Trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in St Kitts ahead of the main business next week. Jonathan Trott failed twice with the bat during England's warm-up for the first Test in Basseterre . Trott is dismissed by his England team-mate James Anderson in St Kitts . Trott\u2019s only rival for the opener slot, Yorkshire\u2019s Adam Lyth, was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but Alastair Cook and Ian Bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match. England gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first Test as their low-key warm-up week meandered to a close. Their four days of cricket  have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action. Trott looks set to open the batting with Alastair Cook in Antigua in the first Test next week . England completed four days of low-key, uncompetitive warm-up action in Basseterre on Thursday . Alastair Cook . Jonathan Trott . Gary Ballance . Ian Bell . Joe Root . Ben Stokes . Jos Buttler . Chris Jordan . Stuart Broad . James Tredwell . Jimmy Anderson . The decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow Chris Jordan and James Tredwell to face some admittedly low-quality bowling, suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team. Barring a raging turner in Antigua next week there will be only one spinning place and Tredwell, already a likelier pick than Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit. His dismissal gave Rashid a chance of his own but Tredwell was given priority and can now start preparing for a second Test cap. Jordan, meanwhile, was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session, when England pressed for an extra half-hour's play following rain delays. That suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett, who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case. Captain Cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on Thursday . Ian Bell looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired . England will leave St Kitts and head to Antigua for the first Test against the West Indies on Monday . Those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill, with Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side, while Gary Ballance, Trott and Root featured for both teams at various points. Bell looked in best form, making a fluent 43 before retiring, while captain Cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session.",

The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck \u2013 but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property \u2013 leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour\u2019s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over \u00a32million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a \u00a320million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for \u00a36.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for \u00a34.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents\u2019 in the hope of securing it for his family \u2013 his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: \u2018There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.\u2019 Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election. Eye for detail: The living room inside Campbell's \u00a36.75million Chelsea flat boasts lavish furnishings . Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a \u2018cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well\u2019. He told The Times: \u2018With a mansion tax, you\u2019re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I\u2019d leave. I\u2019d have to say, \u201cSorry, I want to ship out\u201d.\u2019 Campbell has also said: \u2018I\u2019m not earning what I was earning five years ago.\u2019 Experts have said that properties worth between \u00a35million and \u00a310million could incur an annual charge of up to \u00a325,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: \u2018Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.\u2019 Since 2009 Campbell has also owned Grade II-listed Hallington Hall, an 18th Century mansion in Northumberland. Fortune: Campbell accumulated a number of properties before and after his football career but has since said 'I don't earn what I used to' Campbell recently featured in a hard-hitting campaign to encourage ethnic minority Britons to vote .",

Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days after her initial report to police saying she was groped by Weinstein during a 'business meeting' at his office in Manhattan. It has been claimed the delay was because the Italian model and her manager were working behind the scenes to try and land her a film role. But once the 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to pursue the criminal case, sources told the New York Post. See below for video . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan last Friday night . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . After filing her police report on Friday, March 27, Battilana was eventually interviewed by Manhattan DA prosecutors on Wednesday, April 1, at the NYPD Special Victims Squad's office in East Harlem. Sources told the New York Post her former lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, withdrew from the case as he was concerned Battilana did not appear to be a 'serious victim'. The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and even tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat. But her new lawyer, David Godosky, refuted the claims, saying: 'She immediately went to the police, immediately cooperating with the Special Victims Squad.' Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse yesterday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Weinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall. The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night. She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported. Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'",

Kate, 33, is due to give birth to her second child in the coming days - providing a little brother or sister to Prince George. William's wife already has a nanny at her disposal as well as her mother Carole, who is moving into the Cambridges' Norfolk home Anmer Hall after the new baby arrives. Scroll down for video . Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George poses for photographers outside St. Mary's Hospital in London shortly after giving birth in 2013. She is currently preparing to give birth to her second child . So just how difficult is it to care for a newborn with a toddler running around? Very, as it turns out. Parenting blogger Emily-Jane Clark, who runs the popular site\u00a0How To Survive A Sleep Thief, which she describes as 'an antithesis to baby advice', has compiled a list of the ways that a mother can cope with caring for two kids under two. They including avoiding a double buggy, buying several blue bowls and never setting a specific time for meeting people. Read on to catch some of Emily's top tips... Having two children is significantly harder than having one, according to the experts (picture posed by models) 1. Do not bother trying to get anything done ever. While it is tricky to get stuff done with one baby, with two it is practically impossible. I have lost entire days trying to get things done and achieved nothing. You think, 'I know; I\u2019ll write a list, get organised, tick things off as I go along.' Easy, right? Wrong. Five days later you realise you haven\u2019t even managed to finish writing the bloody list. So I suggest doing what you can when you can. Better still just use this list: . Get up.\u00a0Look after the children. Anything achieved alongside this list is automatically a bonus. 2. Don\u2019t buy a double buggy. You will use it once, realise it is really heavy and annoying and sell it on Ebay. 3. Do not try to get anywhere on time. With two babies on the go, everything takes ages. \u2018Popping out\u2019 becomes a distant memory. I remember a time when nipping out for milk simply meant taking clothes out of the wardrobe, putting them on, grabbing my bag and leaving the house. Now it can take hours as I desperately attempt to scrub baby snot from my clothes with baby wipes, clean bums, clean teeth, change nappies, feed baby, break up fights, chase toddler, dress toddler, dress baby, leave house, forget bag, return to house, leave house, forget baby, return to house, get baby, leave house and then when I finally get to shop, I have forgotten what the hell I went for. As a mother of two young children, it is almost impossible to get anywhere on time (picture posed by models) 4. Someone always wants something from you. A banana, a biscuit, a drink, a dummy, a poo, a wee, a wipe, dinner, lunch, breakfast, a snack, toys, clothes. Take me outside, take me home, take me to the toilet, take me to the park? Story, piggyback, Play Doh, song. Your life becomes an endless cycle of getting stuff for small people. Some days you\u2019ll want to quit. Other days you\u2019ll want to scream. But you still get them the stuff. Because at the end of the day, it is far easier than being asked for the stuff, over and over again, ALL DAY LONG. 5. When you are expecting your second baby you will secretly worry whether you will love him or her as much as you love your first. Surely, it must be impossible to love another human being as much as you love your firstborn? There could never be a baby as cute, or as funny, or as beautiful. Then baby two arrives and they are just as cute, just as funny and just as beautiful. And before you know it, you can\u2019t imagine life without them. When children are young, they always want whatever toy the other is playing with (picture posed by models) 6. Get an extra pair of eyes to put in the back of your head because, at one point, your children will try to kill each other. Not intentionally, of course. But toddlers seem to be under the impression that \u2018dangerous\u2019 means fun. For example; 'It will be so funny to whack my sister over the head with a mug.' And 'I wonder what will happen if I stick this pencil right up my sister\u2019s nose.' 7. Buy two of everything. They always want what the other one has. Toddler could pick up a dead frog and Baby would still drop whatever she was doing and decide she desperately wants that dead frog more than anything in the world. You can tell them to share until you are blue in the face. But apparently \u2018share\u2019 is toddler speak for \u2018snatch\u2019. Prince William and Kate with their son Prince George, who will soon have a younger brother or sister . 8. I would also suggest that all the children\u2019s cups and bowls are the same colour. We have a single blue bowl that is currently making my life hell. 9. Having two children close in age can be exhausting and frustrating. It is rare that a day goes by where I haven\u2019t silently sworn about something. But mostly, it is pretty amazing. And there is a great comfort in knowing that no matter what, they will always have each other. When they are not trying to kill each other, they are best friends\u2026at least until they both want the blue bowl.",

Mandy Dunford, 54, was followed around her farm in the North Yorkshire Moors by 67-year-old Kenneth Ward, naked apart from socks and boots. The military historian even performed sex acts in front of her. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. Farmer Mandy Dunford, 54 (right), feels forced to leave her home after neighbour Kenneth Ward, 67 (left), who was jailed for exposing himself to her in 2011, was released from prison and allowed to return to his home . Police had discovered of a cache of weapons, including machine guns, in his home. A judge at Teesside Crown Court also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning the flasher from being within 200 metres of Miss Dunford. But while the former police officer believed her nine-year ordeal of harassment was over, Ward has now been released \u2013 and has successfully appealed to have the restraining order overturned. It means he will be able to return to his cottage next door to Miss Dunford\u2019s farm in Chop Gate, North Yorkshire. As a result, she said she feels forced to leave. \u2018I feel yet again that the offender has been given more rights than the victim,\u2019 the farmer said. \u2018My punishment for his crimes has been far worse than anything he has ever faced \u2013 I\u2019m losing my home so that he can return to his \u2026 I expected to live here for the rest of my life with my animals around me.\u2019 In a hearing held since Ward\u2019s sentencing, a new boundary was drawn up allowing him to approach Miss Dunford\u2019s farm from all sides. She added: \u2018It means he can follow me around with only the width of a wire fence between us. \u2018When I heard the order had been changed \u2026 I was horrified and I knew my only option was to pack up and leave. I will be forced to abandon my home and my life just so that he can return \u2026 I can\u2019t see the justice in that and I want to know why the rights of a man who tortured me for so long are more important than mine.\u2019 Miss Dunford\u2019s problems with Ward began when she put a gate across a lane shared by their properties. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. However, he has now been released and allowed to return home . She said: \u2018He first started exposing himself to me around 2002 and would peer in through my windows with his wild staring eyes. \u2018He\u2019d run around the house at night shouting and tapping on the windows \u2026 he\u2019d come right up to me and follow me around wearing nothing but boots and socks. \u2018Sometimes he\u2019d climb a ladder and expose himself over the wall of his cottage and once he confronted me on the lane and aimed a rifle at me. I turned and ran and heard five shots go off \u2026 I went to the police to report him but their response was hopeless.\u2019 Ward and his brother also left piles of maggot-infested animal carcasses outside her home. Police finally arrested him after Miss Dunford filmed the harassment and showed them hours of footage.",

Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly joined Michelle to surprise the crowd,and opened the broadcast with a gospel medley that included the song 'Alpha & Omega' and the hit single 'Say Yes' from Michelle's 'Journey To Freedom' CD. The group received a rousing standing ovation from the 9,000-plus crowd, but they weren't introduced as Destiny's child - they were introduced by their individual names. Scroll down for video . Nameless: Singers Michelle Williams, Kelly Rowland and Beyonce performing \"Say Yes\" during the 30th Annual Stellar Awards in Las Vegas last week. The singers did not refer to themselves as Destiny's Child . Touchdown: Destiny's Child perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl XLVII Halftime Show in 2013 . Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively that the threesome want to do another ten-year reunion tour and intend to cut a reunion album - but they won't use the group name for that either. And it's all by design. 'Alhough Destiny's Child is made up of the three ladies, Beyonc\u00e9's father and former manager Mathew Knowles owns one-fourth of the group as well. Anytime they do anything under the name Destiny's Child, he has involvement in it and money from it,' a source close to the group reveals to Daily Mail Online. None of the members of Destiny's Child want any involvement with Mathew, who once managed each of their individual careers as well as the group. Kelly was first to fire him in 2009, Michelle followed in 2010 and Beyonc\u00e9 finally nixed all dealings with her dad after accusations of stealing money from her in 2011. Mathew's marriage to Beyonc\u00e9's mother Tina Knowles ended after it surfaced he had gotten a woman named Alexsandra Wright pregnant. Once she gave birth to their son Nixon, Tina filed for divorce. In 2014, it was revealed that Mathew fathered a second child, a four-year-old daughter named Koi. 'That it was claimed Mathew stole money from Beyonc\u00e9 and then he sued to prove that he didn't was bad enough. But all of the extramarital affairs and children outside the marriage just made it so that Beyonc\u00e9 doesn't have anything to do with her dad at all,' the source explained. Before the split: Destiny's Child and Matthew Knowles pose for a portrait October 30, 2000 in Houston . In late 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary, 'Beyonc\u00e9: Life Is But a Dream.' But after \u00a0that, says the source, she stopped communicating with him again and his only access to her is via her assistant's work email address. The trio's unwillingness to deal with Mathew is why they keep putting off a Destiny's Child reunion album and tour. Their 2005 Destiny Fulfilled tour grossed approximately $70.8 million in the U.S. alone and according to Billboard it was the highest-grossing tour for either a pop or R&B band since TLC's FanMail Tour. Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly and Michelle wanted to record a 10-year follow-up CD and launch a tour. They know both the album and tour could a huge seller and break tour records. 'The problem is they can't figure out how to nix Mathew from the deal. They all want more than anything to give the fans one last run of the group, especially since they all have their own individual success, but don't want to deal with Mathew,' the source explained. It's unlikely that Mathew would allow the women to cut any deals without him. His financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month. Destiny's Child first album debuted in \u00a01998 . In late 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 invited her dad to meet daughter Blue Ivy and to have a conversation with him that was chronicled for her HBO documentary. But after that, says the source, she stopped communicating . Last December photos emerged of a huge garage sale he was having in Houston, where selling both Beyonc\u00e9 and old Destiny's Child memorabilia to raise money. 'At best they maybe could offer him a flat rate or one-time settlement to buy out his portion of the group, but otherwise we may never get a Destiny's Child reunion because none of them want him to benefit financially,' the source concluded. Destiny's Child made their debut in 1998 with their self-titled release. The group then consisted of Beyonc\u00e9, Kelly, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett. In 1999, Mathew kicked out LaTavia and LeToya and replaced them with Michelle and a short-lived member Farrah Franklin (she barely lasted three months) before settling in as a trio. They would release four additional albums; win three Grammy Awards and go on to sell more than 60 million records worldwide. Mathew Knowles financial problems have been widely reported over the last year. Having once earned millions of dollars, Mathew told a court during a child support hearing in 2014 that he only made $127K in 2013 and has expenses of at $51,000 a month . Last December photos emerged of a huge garage sale Knowles was having in Houston, where selling both Beyonc\u00e9 and old Destiny's Child memorabilia to raise money. Giant Beyonce posters sold \u00a0for $200 . T-shirts for sale: . After their breakup in 2005, Beyonc\u00e9 became an international pop star with five solo albums releases and 17 Grammy wins. In addition to starring in movies like Dreamgirls, Obsessed, The Pink Panther and Cadillac Records; Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband Jay-Z became friends of President Barack and Michelle Obama. Kelly first became a top-selling European music superstar before finding solo success in the U.S. with hit singles like 'When Love Takes Over' and 'Motivation.' With four solo albums under her belt, she's won a Grammy Award as a solo artist and became a judge for both Simon Cowell's The X Factor UK and The X Factor US editions. Michelle was has released three chart-topping Gospel CDs and dance album called 'Unexpected.' She's also starred in multiple Broadway productions including Aida, The Color Purple, Chicago, and Fela!. In addition to co-hosting Oxygen's Fix My Choir series, she's been named a frontrunner as a new co-host for ABC's The View.",

Days later, the one-year-old bully breed mix showed up sickly and covered in dirt at a nearby farm. Now, the dog that defied death is recovering with the help of good Samaritans and veterinarians at Washington State University. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Ryann Simmons sits with the dog his girlfriend is fostering at their home in Moses Lake, Wash. The dog, Theia, survived being run over, beaten with a hammer and buried, and now needs surgery . Heroic: Theia, a 1-year-old bully breed mix was hit by a car and then struck in the head with a hammer and buried, but she managed to dig herself out . Hanging on: A driver hit the dog with a car -- and that person proceeded to strike the dog. The dog appeared to be hit with hammer in a mercy killing. The dog used to roam the streets getting scraps of food from people in Moses Lake, a farm town about 100 miles west of Spokane. About a month ago, she was struck by a car. Then things got worse: Someone cracked her in the head with a hammer and placed her in a box in a farm field. But the dog somehow survived and was discovered at a nearby farm with a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity. The wounds helped veterinarians piece together what happened, including the hammer blow. 'I'm assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery,' said Sara Mellado, who learned about the dog's plight on Facebook and took the animal into her Moses Lake home. She named the dog Theia. Recover: Theia is scheduled to go into surgery in a few weeks time after raising money through crowdfunding . New lease of life: Theia, who truly rose from the grave, rarely stops wagging her tail . Back on all fours! Theia's injuries include a dislocated jaw and multiple bone fractures around her nasal cavity, which makes it difficult for her to eat and breathe but it looks as though she is truly on the mend . 'Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,' Mellado told The Associated Press. 'She's a true miracle dog, and she deserves a good life.' Theia is receiving care at WSU's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Pullman. A CT scan of her skull revealed a condition that constricts the nasal passages, restricting air flow into the lungs, said veterinary resident Andrea Sundholm, who's assisting with Theia's treatment. It was caused by multiple nasal bone fractures. When Theia tries to draw air in through her nose, she's forced to open her mouth to breathe instead. But with a dislocated jaw, that is challenging as well. Theia's jaw is healing on its own, but the nasal-bone fractures have caused lasting problems, Sundholm said. Fixing that will require surgery to insert a stent, she said. Help out: Mellado has raised more than $12,000 towards the dog's surgery using the crowdfunding website GoFundMe. So far, contributions have come from Moses Lake, Washington State University and elsewhere . Ouch! X-rays of Theia's skull show the damage that was caused by everything she went through . The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund awarded $700 to help pay for Theia's early treatment. Mellado has raised another $10,000 for the surgery through a crowdfunding website, and is planning to call WSU to schedule the procedure. The university said despite her injuries, Theia is friendly and likes to kiss people's cheeks. Mellado said she has been deluged with calls from people seeking to help. Theia is staying with Mellado's family until they find her a permanent home. 'She's a puppy,' Mellado said. 'She's outgoing, lovable, up for meeting new people.'",

But many current systems fail to solve the problem of how energy is managed and used overnight when the sun sets. Traditionally, energy gathered during the day is sent back to the grid, but this can prove costly if you need to buy it back - unless you have a smart battery that stores the excess energy in your home. Sonnenspeicher (pictured) uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harnessed by solar panels. This energy can be used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity back to the grid, homeowners can then use their stored supply for power . With this in mind, German firm Automatic Storage Device (ASD) and designer Wolfram Walter have created the Sonnenspeicher. It uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store the energy harvested during the day by solar panels fitted to a roof. This energy is used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity to the grid, and potentially having to buy it back at a later date or time, homeowners can use this stored supply to power their home until the sun rises again. Sonnenspeicher\u00a0features an intelligent management system that automatically controls the charging and discharging current, to make it easier to manage how much energy is being used.

Prices start at\u00a0\u20ac8,450 (\u00a36,170).

For example, whenever there is energy in the battery available, the connection to the grid is locked. When this energy runs out, the Sonnenspeicher connects to the grid 'in a millisecond'. This switchover works the other way too. If a home is predominantly powered by the grid, the Sonnenspeicher will still store energy and instead act like a generator during a power cut. 'We wanted to create a storage system that makes you truly independent of the national power grid, that adequately supplies all of your household appliances at all times, and that remains efficient and trouble-free for at least 20 years, so that you can have the peace of mind that your investment really is worth every penny,' said the firm.

The firm said an average home can save around \u20ac1,200 a year (\u00a3876), so it would still take around seven years to recoup the costs, but the system will last for 20 years.",

Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 . 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video . The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 . Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National . Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding.\u00a0And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to \u00a310,000. Her team will be led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household. Waley-Cohen is a Celebrity Ambassador for The Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) and was famously pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge at the Roller Disco he organised to raise money for a ward in memory of his brother.",

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com\u00a0said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .",

He did so beaming from ear to ear, admitting that he had seen the tweets from his Manchester United team-mates congratulating him on scoring what he called \u2018one of the most important goals of my life\u2019. Not everyone had been as complimentary as Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney, with Sky pundit Thierry Henry criticizing him for not immediately running to Cristiano Ronaldo who played the ball to him for the goal. Javier Hernandez (left) scores to send Real Madrid into the Champions League semi-final . Hernandez struck in the 88th minute to send Madrid through and fierce rivals Atletico Madrid out . Marca (left) say Hernandez scored 'the goal of his life' while AS praises 'Chicharito' for winning the tie . To pick up on that and not on the out-pouring of elation is to not understand just how much the Mexican striker has toiled for the last two seasons desperate for a chance to do what he feels he does best \u2013 score big goals in big games. \u2018It was a great assist [from Ronaldo]\u2019 he said after the match once the adrenalin levels that sent him sprinting towards the Real Madrid supporters behind the stadium\u2019s south goal, had subsided. Despite starting only seven of the fifty games Real Madrid have played this season Hernandez has wriggled his way into the affections of the club\u2019s supporters much and on three occasions, he got himself into goalscoring positions on Wednesday night. With the first two opportunities he snatched at the chance \u2013 shooting woefully into the side netting in the first half with Ronaldo and Isco better placed, and pulling another shot across the face of the goal in the second period. But when he hit the target with the third opportunity the stadium responded. His name echoed around all four sides of the ground and that is not something afforded lightly to any player in their first campaign. There was nothing special about the finish but getting there, to apply it when for the previous 88 minutes he had run himself into the ground does deserve credit and he had around 80,000 spectators wanting to thank him personally at the end. Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) provided a splendid assist for Hernandez's goal in the Champions League . Hernandez celebrates Madrid's victory with team-mate Ronaldo after the final whistle . Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick led the tributes to Hernandez on Twitter after the game . The Spanish radio journalists who mobbed him as he emerged from some post-match physiotherapy, all wanted to ask him about the last great Mexican striker to wear the white shirt, Hugo Sanchez. With a goals-per-minutes ratio that is better than Karim Benzema\u2019s, there are even claims he should be starting more games. He replaced the Frenchman last night because of a knee injury that may yet sideline him for another couple of games. Once the euphoria of a last gasp winner subsides, Benzema\u2019s extra quality has to be recognized and \u2018El Chicharito\u2019s\u2019 place will eventually be back on the bench. In the longer-term he could satisfy himself in the knowledge that injuries will always present him with chances like last night. But he wants to be playing regularly and that will mean at the end of the season, when he returns to United, it will be to seek a new permanent deal elsewhere. \u2018He has suffered\u2019 said Carlo Ancelotti after the game. \u2018He deserved the goal because he has never given in. He always trains well and he always gives everything when he plays. It\u2019s a great reward for him.\u2019 Had the 88th minute strike not come and Atletico held on to win on penalties, Ancelotti would have been criticized for his faith in the Mexican and the \u2018Little Pea\u2019 might have played his last minutes for Madrid with only the league left to contest. Some believe Hernandez should start more often ahead of Karim Benzema, who currently has a knee injury . Hernandez missed a couple of chances before scoring, but his persistence eventually paid off for Madrid . Real's players celebrate after Hernandez's late goal secured progress to the Champions League semi-final . As it is Madrid still have nine games to play and he will play his part. He has already written himself a little piece of Madrid history and reminded everyone what he can do. No wonder he ran straight to supporters to wildly celebrate; no wonder he didn\u2019t want to leave the stadium last night.",

The #SkyhighSelfie is one of the unusual extras being offered on the airline's Dreamliner 787 routes, alongside mood lighting to help with jetlag, windows that can be darkened with a touch of a button and full length windows in the toilets. Scroll down for video . All guests on the new Virgin 787 Dreamliner routes will be able to take a selfie and share it on Facebook, with specially-selected cabin shots advised . Developed in conjunction with Jiffybots, this bespoke Facebook application will allow customers to check in free of charge and share their location and photos with their friends and followers mid-flight. Virgin Atlantic is also developing certain #SkyhighSelfie spots in the cabin to offer customers the chance to take the perfect selfie onboard and share their experience. The first selfie spot will go live on Birthday Girl, the first of its 787 aircraft to be purchased, from this month and customers can take their picture with the iconic Virgin Atlantic Flying Lady carrying her celebratory champagne coupe. The app will also act as a sky high discussion forum where customers on the flight can chat and spark debate in the air creating an onboard community. To access the free wifi and check in on Facebook, upload their photo or participate in the onboard discussion form, all customers need to do is click on a specially created link and log in. The mood lighting is available in all classes aboard Virgin's Dreamliner, helping passengers adjust to time zones . The 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable comes on as the plane flattens out on its journey . Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic said: 'This is just one area of our ongoing developments with technology as the connectivity on board our new 787s allows us to deliver innovative and unique digital experiences for our customers. 'Connectivity is a key focus moving forward for Virgin Atlantic and we'll continue the roll out across our fleet over the next two years.' Other key features include full-length mirrors in the bathroom, and special mood lighting. The bar area in business class has been changed so customers can even have meetings face-to-face over a glass of wine, while right, the staff will be able to help you get that perfect selfie . The lighting changes colour throughout the flight to help passengers relax and unwind, fall asleep and even adjust time zones. On boarding the aircraft, a soft 'rose champagne' colour has been chosen to de-stress passengers whilst encouraging them to relax into their journey. This then changes into 'purple haze' which is designed to be cosy and comfortable before transforming into 'amber warmth' which creates a candlelight environment for passengers whilst dining. To help passengers drift into a deep sleep, 'silver moonlight' is introduced to reflect a beautiful moon-lit sky. Virgin executives have realised that connectivity during flights is key with so many of us desiring permanent Wi-Fi . One of the key modifications in business class is a modification of the bar area to make it more social. Two stools now sit opposite each other so customers can dine opposite each other, we also offer pre-dinner cocktails and wine tasting at the bar. Colleagues can also enjoy a business meeting and can actually book the bar for a meeting. The innovative fixtures will be featured on all Virgin Atlantic's 787 Dreamliner routes .",

Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, was once dubbed \u2018Jabba the Hutt\u2019 by bullies and became so depressed over his size that he refused to leave his house for a year. He was just 18 when he took an overdose of 30 pills, but survived, ironically, because he hadn\u2019t taken enough to defeat his massive frame. Scroll down for video . From bulk to hulk: Nathan Priestley, 21, from Norwich, Norfolk, pictured before (left) and after (right) his staggering weight loss, was once dubbed \u2018Jabba the Hutt\u2019 by bullies . Following his suicide attempt in September 2011, something snapped in Nathan and he made the decision to stop wallowing in self-pity and turn his life around. Within two years, he had shrunk to 14 stone. During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds. Nathan ran the streets in the dead of night when no-one was around and turned off the lights so he could use a treadmill at his local gym unseen. After a year, Nathan started using weights to tone his slimmed-down figure, and was so successful he landed himself a job as a personal trainer. Nathan, now a trim 13 stone, said: 'I was always overweight as a kid and as I grew up the bullying contributed to that because I tended to comfort eat. 'Others would throw sweets at me when I was on the bus and call me \"fatty\", \"fat mess\" and \"Jabba the Hutt\". Transformation: Nathan's former 26-stone bulk (left) drove him to a suicide attempt when he was only 18, but he has since lost more than half his bodyweight and is now a ripped gym instructor (right) Following his suicide attempt, something snapped in Nathan, pictured before his weight loss, and he made the decision to stop wallowing in self-pity and turn his life around . During the first year, he would only exercise in the dark from fear others would mock his efforts as he struggled to start shedding the pounds . 'It was at that period in high school where I started to become really self-conscious about my weight. 'I didn\u2019t leave the house for a year and the only time I would leave my room would be to go downstairs to get food.' Nathan added: 'My parents were really worried about me and tried to tell me to go and see somebody for help. 'After the failed suicide I realised that I needed to turn my life around and I started to diet. 'It was scary going outside and I was too afraid to leave the house because I thought people would be judging me. Before his lifestyle overhaul, Nathan was a sugar addict who gorged on bacon and egg butties, chocolate bars and greasy takeaways. He then went cold turkey and cut out junk food, chocolate, crisps and alcohol, and said he was left suffering from flu-like symptoms as a result. Nathan snacked on cashew nuts and went on a strict low-carb diet which helped him lose a stone a month for eight months. In progress: Nathan said, 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence, so for the first month it was purely diet' He added,\u00a0'When I did eventually start going to the gym, I used to run in a darkened room which was there for people with low self-esteem' 'I never went to the gym at the beginning because I had no confidence so for the first month it was purely diet. 'Then I would get up at three or four in the morning to go for a jog because I didn\u2019t want anybody to see me. 'When I did eventually start going to the gym, I used to run in a darkened room which was there for people with low self-esteem.' By September 2013 - exactly two years after his suicide attempt - Nathan had dropped 14 stone, and has spent the last year dedicating his time to building the perfect body. Nathan now plans to enter body building competitions to showcase his transformation. Old ways: Before his lifestyle overhaul, Nathan was a sugar addict who gorged on bacon and egg butties, chocolate bars, alcohol and greasy takeaways, all of which he then quit cold turkey . 'I just want to show that it is possible to achieve what you want and it is never too late to get to where we want to be in life,' he said. 'I am so much happier now and my life at the moment has completely changed around from where it was three years ago.' He added: 'I am single but I do get attention from girls that I obviously wouldn't have got before. 'I want to show the people that bullied and harassed me that no matter how hard they beat me down, I will achieve more than them. 'If you\u2019re unhappy with yourself, nothing is impossible and you should follow your dreams to become the absolute best version of yourself.'

Hundreds of British teenagers see ISIS as 'pop idols' like One Direction and Justin Bieber, putting children in danger of being radicalised, the country's most senior Muslim prosecutor has said. Nafir Afzal said teenagers are at risk of 'jihadimania' and warned that 'another 7/7' could happen unless Britain makes sweeping changes to the way it tackles terrorism. Mr Afzal, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the north-west, said children are 'manipulated' by Islamists and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation. He told the Guardian's Nigel Bunyan:\u00a0'The boys want to be like them and the girls want to be with them. That's what they used to say about the Beatles and more recently One Direction and Justin Bieber. The propaganda the terrorists put out is akin to marketing, and too many of our teenagers are falling for the image. 'They see their own lives as poor by comparison, and don't realise they are being used. The extremists treat them in a similar way to sexual groomers \u2013 they manipulate them, distance them from their friends and families, and then take them.' Mr Afzal added that a community-led approach to dealing with teenagers who have been corrupted by terrorists would be more successful than the 'stale' strategy used by the police and security services. The prosecutor warned that unless the next government recruited young Muslim role models to help mentor those who are being radicalised, the country could face 'another 7/7' terror attack. He believes that young people are far more likely to listen to people who have gone through their experiences than authority figures. 'At the moment, even the language is wrong. People talk about Isis as if they have some kind of religious basis or political dimension \u2013 a kind of glossy, glorious campaign,' he said. Mr Afzal said teenagers are 'manipulated' by ISIS (file picture) and that Britain needs a new approach in the way it deals with radicalisation . The prosecutor said some Muslim teenagers see Islamists as 'pop idols' like Justin Bieber (left) and One Direction (Harry Styles, right) 'The reality is that they're no more than narcissistic, murderous cowboys. We need to stand up and say that very, very clearly, rather than allow kids to be drawn to them like the equivalent of pop idols.' Hundreds of young Muslims are thought to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, but Mr Afzal believes there are far more 'ticking time bombs' still in Britain. His comments came as it emerged that the Labour councillor's son caught trying to cross from Turkey to Syria with his family may be part of an extremist group. Waheed Ahmed, 21 \u2013 the son of councillor Shakil Ahmed \u2013 is said to be a member of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, which advocates a global Muslim caliphate, similar to the one established by ISIS. Ahmed, a politics student at Manchester University, was arrested by Turkish police at the border town of Reyhanli last week. He was one of a group of nine detained, all from Rochdale, including four children aged from one to 11. They could be flown back to the UK today. Nafir Afzal last month quit the CPS despite being cleared of allegations suggesting he texted a defendant in a case. In the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS. Mr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences. This included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions. He said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice. More recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall. He also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse. The prosecutor last year claimed that there would be a fresh wave of Operation Yewtree arrests concerning the abuse of children by celebrities. He said: 'This is a growing industry. There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some are very high-profile figures.' Mr Afzal began his CPS career in central London and went on to be awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.

The outspoken Rochdale candidate said it was 'unacceptable' that people who were prepared to join ISIS should be free to come home. It comes after nine members of the same family were arrested in Turkey \u2013 including the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor in Rochdale. Scroll down for video . Waheed Ahmed (right) - the son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - and his cousins walk into the Turkish Police Department's Foreigners' office today after being caught trying to cross into Syria . The family \u2013 including Councillor Shakil Ahmed's son Waheed, his cousins, aunt and four children \u2013 are expected return to the UK from Turkey this week. Coun Ahmed, 45 \u2013 who was photographed with Labour leader Ed Miliband just weeks ago \u2013 served alongside Mr Danczuk's wife Karen on the Town Council until her resignation in January. But Mr Danczuk today lashed out at suggestions that the family could be allowed to return to Britain without facing any terror charges. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Danczuk said: 'I think I speak for the vast majority of people in Rochdale in saying that this family will not be welcome back in Rochdale.' Mr Danczuk added: 'The Islamic State in Syria are carrying out sickening and barbaric acts of inhumanity and anyone who pledges their allegiance to this cruel and twisted ideology will rightly be seen as an enemy of the UK. 'Waheed and his family were apprehended trying to get into Syria and had they been allowed to cross the border then I've been given to believe Waheed would now be getting trained up to fight for ISIS. Mr Danczuk said they were not welcome back in Rochdale . 'The police have to recognize this, because the idea that someone who was prepared to join a terrorist outfit like ISIS could be allowed to return to civilian life in Rochdale and carry on as though nothing has happened is unacceptable.' It shares a border with part of Syria controlled by rebel factions including those linked to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Rochdale nine are the biggest family group caught attempting to enter the unstable territory. The three men and two women, aged between 21 and 47, were taken to a hospital with their children, aged one, three, eight and 11 after being apprehended last week. Photographs showed Waheed Ahmed, dressed in traditional robes and wearing heavy boots, leading the group from a minibus into a police station. Several women, all wearing headscarfs which covered their faces, could be seen carrying children. Most of the party were wearing walking boots, perfect for trekking across the rugged region. Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters and others hoping to reach Islamic State-held areas of Syria and Iraq. The Ahmed family are originally from Kashmir but settled in Rochdale in the 1980s and have lived in their current home since 2006. Coun Ahmed posted a picture of himself with Labour leader Ed Miliband on his Facebook page just before Christmas. Their arrest came after Yahya Rashid, 19, was charged with preparing acts of terrorism after flying into Luton Airport from Istanbul.

Waheed smiled in a car as he left a hospital after undergoing medical checks and fingerprinting in Hatay southern of Turkey last week . He is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group. Mr Danczuk said the number of Britons fleeing the country to join ISIS \u2013 now thought to number more than 600 \u2013 exposed the failure of the Government's anti-terror strategy. He said: 'I have spent the last few days in discussions with the Foreign Office minister, Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, local authority leaders, religious groups and local people.' Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the British family caught trying to cross into would be forced to train up as ISIS fighters . The outspoken candidate added: 'The message coming back to me loud and clear is that while the vast majority reject this ideology of hatred, exclusion and intolerance, there are some people who are susceptible to radicalization. 'I do not think the Government's Prevent strategy is working and we need a much smarter approach from all the authorities to stop this cancer spreading.'

Oliveira has won 14 caps for his country and was once linked to a \u00a324million move to Manchester United, but his career has stalled at Benfica and Swansea is his third loan spell in as many seasons. The 23-year-old has found it tough to make an impression in south Wales but he is set to make his second Barclays Premier League start at bottom club Leicester on Saturday with Gomis sidelined by hamstring trouble. Nelson Oliveira is on-loan at Swansea from Portuguese giants Benfica but has struggled for first-team action . The striker (right) has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury and is expected to start against\u00a0Leicester . 'I've had to be patient waiting for my chance,' Oliveira told the official Swansea website. 'But that's understandable. It's normal that when you join a very good team who are doing well and are eighth in the table, then you have to wait for your chance.' Gomis has been ruled out for between three to four weeks after being injured in the early stages of last weekend's 1-1 home draw with Everton. The France international has scored four goals in seven games and Oliveira, who has recovered from a training-ground ankle injury in time to feature at the King Power Stadium, admits that Gomis' form has made life difficult for him. Oliveira is hoping to take his Swansea chance presented to him by the absence of the in-form Bafetimbi Gomis . 'Bafe has been doing very well and scoring goals,' said Oliveira, who has made seven of his eight Swansea appearances from the bench with his only start coming in the 5-0 home defeat to Chelsea in January. 'He's a good player and person and I feel for him because of the injury. 'He's been in a good moment and is important to the team. 'I'm not happy he is injured, but if it gives me a chance then I really want to take it; work hard, play well and help the team. 'It would be nice to score my first goal for the club and I'm always confident in my own ability. Manager Garry Monk is set to hand\u00a0Oliveira only the second Premier League start of his career at Swansea . 'And I know, the more I play the more confident I will get.' The injury to Gomis on the back of selling Wilfried Bony to Manchester City in January has highlighted the shortage of strikers at Swansea, and manager Garry Monk has made no secret of the fact that it is one department where the club need to strengthen this summer. 'It is an area where we need to help those who are here,' Monk said. 'We still need to look at Nelson and Marvin Emnes is not an out and out striker. 'Hopefully Nelson can have some more game time but we are looking to strengthen that area.'",

The latest research, by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98.7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97.6 per cent . They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr Guest said: 'These results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. 'It is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a 'reluctance to embrace this tested, time-old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts. There is no single test for prostate cancer, but the most commonly used are blood tests, a physical examination or a biopsy.

Prostate cancer, pictured, is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year . 'Over the years, millions of pounds of NHS funding has been poured into the traditional test methods, and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability,' Dr Guest added. 'This has caused a huge waste of resources, not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals. 'Moreover, the detection dogs provide alternative solution that yields consistently accurate results. If our detection dogs were a machine, there would be huge demand for them.' Medical Detection Dogs, which is based in Milton Keynes, trains specialist canines to detect the odour of human disease. They also train Medical Alert Assistance dogs to help people with life-threatening health conditions go about their daily lives. The research is published in the Journal Of Urology.",

The Maglev train completed a test run on a track in Yamanashi, beating the previous record of 361mph (580km/h) set in 2003. Another attempt is scheduled for tomorrow, and engineers at the Central Japan Railway Company predict it could reach 373mph (600km/h). Scroll down for video . A Japanese bullet train has broken the speed record for rail vehicles by reaching 366mph (589km/h) Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. The seven-car train was able to go so fast because it made use of a magnetic charge to lift and move it above a guideway. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h), which will cut the journey time for a 178-mile journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964 . It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. The speeds won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service in 2027 . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe. 'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said. China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (\u00a3830million) to build . 'It's a very difficult system to make operational.' A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher. Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University. The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write.

A group of Nevada sex workers, Hookers For Hillary, have come out in favor of the Democratic contender for president . According to their website, they\u2019re supporting the former secretary of state because of her work on health care reform, foreign relation experience, tax reform and responsible government oversight on public health issues. 'Hillary Clinton, as part of her husband's administration, envisioned health care reform in the 1990's, long before President Obama was able to sign it into law,' they write. 'The Affordable Health Care Act made health insurance available for the first time ever to the 500 independent contractors employed by Dennis Hof. With any Republican nominee likely to work for its' repeal, the Bunnies want to protect the quality health coverage that they now enjoy.' 'As Secretary Of State, Hillary Clinton gained invaluable experience negotiating with foreign leaders, and the Bunnies can definitely relate to negotiating through a language barrier,' they state. The group cite Clinton's work on health care reform, foreign experience, tax reform and responsible government oversight on public health issues as reasons to vote for her . The hookers all work at Dennis Hof's Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Carson City . 'The Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will.' 'Bill Clinton presided over the most prosperous time in Bunny Ranch history, which coincided with a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans such as brothel owner Dennis Hof,' the Bunny Ranch writes. 'The Bunnies recognize that thriving economies are built from the bottom up, where the vast majority of their clients originate. 'A return to relying on the disproven theory of trickle-down economics would only serve to exclude the vast majority of hard-working Bunny Ranch clients from having the discretionary income to enjoy with their favorite Bunny.' Citing Nevada's mandatory testing of legal prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases, the Bunny Ranch also applauded Mrs. Clinton for recognizing 'the fact that responsible government oversight is a key to protecting the public's health from widespread disease.'",

After next month's election, ministers could be asked to make sure Easter Day always falls between April 9 and 15, so businesses can plan holiday rotas in advance and allow the travel industry to better prepare for the summer season. In 1928, the Easter act was passed in Parliament to make sure that the holiday weekend would be a fixed date in April. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and his wife Samantha attend an Easter Sunday service at St Nicholas Church in Oxfordshire. After next month's general election, minister could be asked to consider fixing the date of Easter . Both the House of Commons and House of Lords passed the Act but it was unable to get the agreement of churches and therefore has never been implemented. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church did not object to the plans although, they were never seriously discussed. But just before the dissolution of Parliament last week, Conservative Sir Greg Knight, who is defending his East Yorkshire seat at the general election, asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. This also prompted the National Secular Society to write to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding Easter be a set date in April. Pope Francis leads Easter Mass in St Peter's Square in the Vatican. It is thought that the Roman Catholic Church do not object to the plans to fix a date for Easter . The letter by the society's executive director Keith Porteous Wood, said: 'The variation of the date of Easter by over a month causes significant and unnecessary inconvenience. This is particularly disruptive to the orderly planning of school terms and to business. 'As you will be aware, the law requires large shops, including supermarkets and even DIY stores, to close on Easter Sunday. 'The high proportion of the population that are not observant Christians, be they religiously unconcerned or of other faiths, are prevented from using them then, when many would want to do so. 'We support the rights of those who wish to observe Easter, but is is unreasonable and disrespectful to the remainder of the population for the operation of the law to prevent them from shopping then in such outlets.' Spectators gather to watch the The Passion of the Christ production on Good Friday in Trafalgar Square.\u00a0But just before the dissolution of Parliament, Conservative Sir Greg Knight asked ministers if there were any plans to implement the Easter Act 1928. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday always falls on the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon . The Local Government Association and the Family and Childcare Trust have also backed the plan, saying that at least the two-week Easter school holidays should be the same every year to allow parents to plan childcare. However, according to the Independent Business Minister Jo Swinson said there was 'no indication' that Easter would become a fixed date. On the Gregorian calendar, used in the UK, Easter Sunday is always the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon. The Paschal full moon is the first full moon occurring on or after the spring equinox, meaning Easter weekend usually falls any time between March 22 and April 25. But since this shifts from year to year, most people follow the calendrical spring equinox, which is reckoned as March 21. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Easter is determined using the Julian calendar and is always celebrated after the Jewish festival of Passover. This year it will be celebrated on April 12, next Sunday.",

In Twitter\u2019s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans \u2013 just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000.

Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter \u2013 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton\u2019s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez\u2019s side.

The strips, produced by sportswear giants Nike, have caused a bit of stir across the pond, because of the decision to go with a black and white colour scheme rather than the traditional red, white and blue. But striker\u00a0Alex Morgan hailed Nike's design as innovative. 'The black and white are different from anything we've ever had before,' she said, before adding, 'You know it's not a lot of red, white and blue in the white one because they wanted a clean look. I think it stands out in the fact that it is clean and just simple and I love that.' Scroll down for video . (Left to right:) Tobin Heath, Alex Morgan and Sydne Leroux of the USA women's soccer team pose . T he USA women's soccer team have unveiled their new kits for the World Cup hosted by Canada in June . There has been some controversy surrounding the decision to use a black and white colour scheme . Nike spokesperson and global creative director Martin Lotti explained,\u00a0'We always design home and away as one story, so the focus was on the blue with some of the red (for the away), and then the focus on the home was white. 'If you look at it traditionally, actually, all the home kits are always white. So we're actually not changing the history. In face we are being authentic to the history where it's always a white kit.' Nike have opted to put the focus of the new kit on the feet first and worked their way up. The neon yellow socks or 'volt' in Nike parlance are aimed to draw attention to the bright blue cleats. 'It's the first time as well that (the kit) is fully integrated, so going from the boot right to the sock, then it fades from the volt into the white kit,' Lotti said, 'It's a real head-to-toe look.' The USA women's team kick off their World Cup campaign against Australia on June 8 with a group match in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Some people have questioned the decision to abandon the USA's traditional red, white and blue colours .

Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch star in the new season, which premieres June 21. Here's the plot synopsis, according to Den of Geek: . \"A bizarre murder brings together three law-enforcement officers and a career criminal, each of whom must navigate a web of conspiracy and betrayal in the scorched landscapes of California. Colin Farrell is Ray Velcoro, a compromised detective in the all-industrial City of Vinci, LA County. Vince Vaughn plays Frank Semyon, a criminal and entrepreneur in danger of losing his life's work, while his wife and closest ally (Kelly Reilly), struggles with his choices and her own. Rachel McAdams is Ani Bezzerides, a Ventura County Sheriff's detective often at odds with the system she serves, while Taylor Kitsch plays Paul Woodrugh, a war veteran and motorcycle cop for the California Highway Patrol who discovers a crime scene which triggers an investigation involving three law enforcement groups, multiple criminal collusions, and billions of dollars.\" Yes, please. The first season starred Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as a pair of Louisiana State Police detectives investigating the death of a young woman.

A known child sex offender has been arrested on suspicion of stealing a school bus and driving it around to pick up youngsters. Patrick James Fredricksen, 30 - who has previous convictions for unlawful sexual activity with a minor and impersonating a firefighter - was stopped on his way to one child's home in eastern Utah, police say. He had already used the bus's on-board list of children's names and addresses to try and abduct a young girl, they added. Fredricksen has now been booked into Emery County Jail for investigation of theft of a vehicle and attempted child kidnapping. He is also expected to face a charge of damaging a prison after breaking a sprinkler pipe inside his cell and flooding the booking area, said sheriff spokeswoman Janalee Luke. Fredricksen's crime spree is alleged to have started while he was laying turf for a landscaping firm at a baseball complex in Huntington on Monday. An employee at the site phoned the local sheriff's office to report a worker 'was acting strange' and had left on foot with a set of master keys to the complex. Shortly afterwards, a nearby funeral-parlor worker reported that his car had been stolen from the company car park. Audacious: Fredricksen is said to have taken an American school bus and driven it to youngsters' homes . He told police he had noticed a 'suspicious' person around the building' but was talking to a bereaved family at the time so 'wasn't too concerned', according to the sheriff's office. They claim Fredricksen was the thief and that he drove the car to an empty school bus, which had its keys inside. 'After stealing the bus and using a list he found in the bus containing names and directions [to children's houses], Fredricksen attempted to pick one child up at her home and was asking directions to a second child's home,' said the sheriff's office. He had been foiled in his first attempt to a child after parking the bus on the family's driveway, according to KSL News.\u00a0The girl's father got to the vehicle first and would not let her board after quizzing the driver. Fredricksen was eventually stopped by a sheriff's lieutenant following a report of a suspicious person driving a school bus in the Cleveland area of Emery County.\u00a0The lieutenant said he halted the slow-moving vehicle by pulling in front of it. The empty school bus, thought to be identical to the ones seen here in Utah, reportedly had its keys inside . Fredricksen, who has also used the names Pat Shelton and Patrick Fredrickson, is on Utah's Sex Offender Registry after pleading guilty in 2004 to unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Court records show he was separately charged in 2005 with sexual exploitation of a minor and dealing in material harmful to a minor but the case was dismissed as part of an apparent plea bargain that resolved another case against him. The following year, Fredricksen was living in Salt Lake County when he pleaded guilty to impersonating a fireman. He had previously worked as a volunteer firefighter for the Huntington Fire Department but was dismissed in 2003 for stealing clothing and equipment. After his dismissal, he pinned on a stolen badge and lent a hand at emergencies, the court was told. He discovered where the real firefighters were working by listening to a police scanner. He also stole firefighting equipment and used his fake status to rent an apartment and get credit, according to newspaper reports from the time. He was sentenced to 36 months of probation and ordered to have counselling.",

The 61-year-old Democrat has pleaded not guilty to eight bribery counts related to his close personal friendship with eye surgeon Dr Salomon Melgen, 60, according to a 68-page federal indictment unsealed this month and detailed in the New York Post. Perhaps the most embarrassing of the accusations is that Menendez used his influence to get visas for married Melgen's multiple young lovers abroad - including a Brazilian model who posed on the cover of 'Sexy' magazine and a Ukrainian actress who moved to Florida to live in one of Melgen's homes. Scroll down for videos . Corrupt? U.S. Senator Robert Menendez faces the possibility of 15 years in prison if convicted of eight counts of bribery for using his political influence to help a wealthy donor in exchange for nearly $1million in campaign contributions and gifts . Melgen's ladies: According to an indictment unsealed this month, Menendez helped donor Dr Salomon Melgen bring at least three mistresses to the U.S. on visas - including Brazilian actress Juliana Lopes Leite (left) and Ukrainian model Svitlana Buchyk (right) Menendez and Melgen met at a fundraiser in 1993, shortly after Menendez was voted into the Senate. The two quickly became close, with Menendez being invited to fly on Melgen's private jet and visit his villa in the Dominican Republic on several occasions. According to the details in the indictment, Menendez began helping out his rich friend in 1998, when Melgen wanted to fly a 22-year-old girlfriend - identified as 'girlfriend 2 in court documents - and her 18-year-old sister from the Dominican Republic to spend Christmas with him in the States. Claiming innocence: Melgen has also been charged in the indictment, in addition to other Medicaid fraud charges, pleading not guilty to both. He is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami . Despite Melgen writing a letter to the embassy in Santo Domingo, the sisters' applications were initially denied due to the fact that they were unemployed and therefore more likely to overstay their visas. When Melgen found got the bad news, he reached out to his friend Menendez for help. Menendez then told his senior policy adviser Mark Lopes that he planned to personally call the ambassador and, if that didn't work, a contact at the State Department. An unidentified high-ranking member in the State Department allegedly responded by telling Menendez that he agreed with the visa decision. Nevertheless, a few weeks later the sisters were re-interviewed and this time their visas were approved. Lopes emailed a colleague after and wrote that it was 'ONLY DUE to the fact that RM intervened.' Menendez next helped Melgen in 2007, when the doctor was trying to get another young woman to visit him in the U.S. The woman identified as 'girlfriend 3' in court documents is described as a Ukrainian actress and model who was 20 years old and living in Spain around the time at Menendez intervened in her immigration process. According to the indictment, a Menendez staffer reached out to the U.S. consul general in Madrid on behalf of a 'famous person in Spain' who was a 'good friend' of Melgen and needed a visa to 'undergo medical evaluation for plastic surgery in the U.S'. 'Dr Melgen is a person of the highest caliber,' Menendez wrote . 'He is a fine citizen and held in high esteem by his peers.' It's believed that 'girlfriend 3' is model Svitlana Buchyk, now 28, a woman who has been tied to Melgen and who lived in Spain before moving to Florida. Svitlana made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car that was registered in Melgen's wife's name. At the time, Buchyk gave police Melgen's address in North Palm Beach as her own. When contacted the the Miami Herald at the time, she told the paper that she worked for Melgen in the past but would not describe what that work involved. 'He treated me well,' she said. 'He had money. He was very generous.' She now allegedly goes by the name Lana Moyzuk and lives in Los Angeles. Employee? Melgen's alleged mistress Svitlana Buchyk (pictured) made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car belonging to Melgen's wife. She told the Miami Herald at the time that she used to work for Melgen, but would not saw in what capacity . It appears Melgen may have been juggling women in 2007, when he brought Buchyk to the U.S., since he also reportedly started dating a famous Brazilian actress that same year. Menendez is also accused of intervening to help this woman to the U.S. a few years later, when she wanted to study law at the University of Miami. The Post has identified \u00a0'girlfriend 1' as 34-year-old Juliana Lopes Leite, who once appeared on Brazil's version of Big Brother and posed nude in several magazines before her move to the U.S. to become a lawyer. The indictment says Menendez knew Leite was one of Melgen's paramours when he agreed to help with her visa application, ordering his adviser Lopes to write a letter in the woman's favor to the State Department. In the letter, lopes wrote that Leite '(no relation to me) \u00a0has her visa application appointment in Brasilia, Brazil, tomorrow . . . Sen. Menendez would like to advocate unconditionally for Dr. Melgen and encourage careful consideration of [Girlfriend 1]\u2019s visa application.' The State Department got back to Menendez's office in just a few hours later and the following day Leite's visa was approved. She graduated from the University of Miami in 2011, and still resides in the city as a lawyer. Melgen is also facing charges in the indictment unsealed this month, in addition to separate 76-count indictment for Medicaid fraud. He remains behind bars at the Federal Detention Center in Miami after being deemed a flight risk. Meanwhile, Menendez continues his role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has raised $1.3million for his legal defense fund.",

He claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the Liberal Democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys. In fact Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib Dem grandee in the years before he died.

He insisted there would be no inquiry despite revelations in Saturday's Daily Mail that the Liberal party \u2013 a forerunner to the Lib Dems \u2013 offered hush money equivalent to a month's wages to an activist after she complained about Smith molesting a teenage boy in 1979. Mr Clegg was confronted over the Smith scandal during a phone-in show on LBC radio yesterday. He was asked by 'John from Bexleyheath' why the Lib Dems had not investigated despite new details of Smith's prolific paedophilia exposed in this paper's serialisation of Labour politician Simon Danczuk's book about the late Rochdale MP. Mr Clegg attempted to distance the Lib Dems from Smith and said 'any political party' should co-operate with the police inquiry. He said: 'As it happens, Cyril Smith, as you may know, the allegations surrounding him, actually go right back to the time when he was a Labour politician, back, well before I was even born, I think.' Mr Clegg accused Mr Danczuk of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. He added: 'Cyril Smith was active in politics, by the way, in a party which no longer exists \u2013 the Liberal party. 'So he was a Labour politician, and then he was a politician for most of his career, for a Liberal party, which no longer exists. All this happened well before the Liberal Democrats were even formed.' Mr Clegg said the only way to get justice was for the police to investigate and blamed them for not having done so. Mr Danczuk, the Labour candidate for Rochdale, said his book made it clear that Smith had started out as a member of the Labour party. Nick Clegg made a desperate attempt to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith today by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician' He added: 'Nobody will be surprised to hear that Nick Clegg is being disingenuous in his comments. Mr Clegg accused Labour's Simon Danczuk (pictured) of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that actually Cyril Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. 'I urge him to face up to the fact that one of his colleagues \u2013 somebody who he and other members of his party celebrated for very many years \u2013 was a paedophile. 'I think it is a disgrace to try to avoid tackling this issue and to try to politicise this issue in the way that he is doing.' Smith was elected as a Liberal MP in 1972, but after the Lib Dems were formed in 1988 took the whip of the new party until his retirement from Parliament in 1992. He remained a Liberal Democrat grandee up to his death in 2010 at the age of 82. A gushing video tribute from Mr Clegg was played at Smith's 80th birthday party at Rochdale town hall in 2008. The Lib Dem leader told him: 'I'm a great admirer of you personally, but also owe you a great debt of gratitude politically too.' The Daily Mail's serialisation of Mr Danczuk's book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, revealed that senior Liberals were made aware of the paedophile MP's abuse. Lord Steel, who as David Steel was Liberal leader from 1976 until 1988 and nominated Smith for a knighthood, was alerted in 1979 to claims that Smith had subjected boys to humiliating spankings but Smith denied any wrongdoing. Senior Lib Dems including the Business Secretary Vince Cable and the former leader Charles Kennedy have insisted they heard nothing. The party has been accused of 'squirming' over the issue.",

Ride Like The Wind was one of 34 colts which remain in the first Classic of the season run on Saturday, May 2. Ride Like The Wind won just one of his four starts last season but he has run twice this term, posting a career best on his most recent start when landing the Group Three Prix Djebel by a head. French trainer Freddy Head likens his 2,000 Guineas hope Ride Like The Wind to Charm Spirit . Both the runner-up that day, Make Believe, and the fifth home, Sinfonietta, could reoppose in the Guineas to make it a three-pronged French assault on the 2,000 Guineas. Head said: \u2018Ride Like The Wind will run in the 2,000 Guineas. He has done very well since his last race, his work has been good, and I think that he has improved a bit. \u2018He is on the same sort of level as Charm Spirit was at this time last year. They are similar horses in that they tend to be a bit keen and if Ride Like The Wind settles better than Charm Spirit did last year I think that he has a good chance. Head says Ride Like The Wind is 'on the same sort of level' as Charm Spirit was at this time last year . \u2018That is why I have given him two runs already this season, to get the freshness out of him before the Guineas. 'I was very happy with his Prix Djebel victory. He settled then quickened well and it was to his credit that he won despite being held up at the back of the field when the pace was slow. 'The undulations at Newmarket won\u2019t be a problem for him and although seven furlongs is a good trip for him at the moment I think that he will stay a mile as long as he relaxes.\u2019 The Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained pair of Gleneagles and Highland Reel head the 2,000 Guineas entries. Also still in contention are the three winners of last week\u2019s Classic trials \u2013 Kool Kompany (Craven Stakes), Home Of The Brave (Free Handicap) and Muhaarar (Greenham Stakes). Gleneagles and Highland Reel, both trained by Aidan O\u2019Brien, lead the entries for the 2,000 Guineas . Roger Varian\u2019s impressive Newbury winner Intilaaq could still be supplemented to the Guineas. Connections would have to pay \u00a330,000 on Monday to add him to the line-up. One colt who is looking likely to be supplemented to the 2,000 Guineas field is Godolphin's Territories, who has pleased Andre Fabre since winning a Group Three at Longchamp. A statement on Godolphin\u2019s website quoted Fabre as saying: \u2018Territories has come out of his trial very well and has come on for the run. At this stage, a supplementary entry in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket is under serious consideration and we are 90% certain to take that route, subject to the horse continuing to please me.\u2019",

Mr Morris says he wasn't driving when his Volvo was photographed doing 57km/h in a 50km/h zone last year. But he won't say who was behind the wheel. He has invoked a spousal privilege case from 1817, arguing it's unconstitutional for a Queensland court to fine him when there's evidence he was not the driver. Scroll down for video . Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws . He says he was in a meeting with top judges when the Volvo was snapped, and they are willing to testify that he was with them. He argues the spousal privilege principle, established in England 200 years ago, means a husband can't be compelled to provide information that incriminates his wife. 'I decline to identify the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the relevant time,' Mr Morris reportedly wrote in a letter to the Department of Transport. Earlier this year, Mr Morris wrote to federal, state and territory attorneys-general saying he planned to challenge parts of Queensland's speed-camera laws.

In a photograph revealed by the Sunday\u00a0Mirror, the 20-year-old is seen taking a drag from the large orange pipe \u2013 containing fruit-scented tobacco and smoked through hot coals via a tube \u2013 in a picture published in the Sunday Mirror. Sterling recently snubbed a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract at Anfield amid fears he could leave the club this summer. Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe . The 20-year-old (second right) recently snubbed a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer from the Merseyside club . The England international (right) played in the Red's FA Cup quarter final win over Blackburn on Wednesday . Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was snapped on a social media site with the picture captioned \u20181 down 3 to go\u2019, suggesting there was more puffing in store for the youngster that night. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes. Having already irked certain Reds fans for refusing to dedicate his immediate future to Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team after being offered the improved contract offer, he could again cut an unpopular figure for putting his health at risk during the Merseysiders\u2019 run in to fight for a top four place in the Premier League. Sterling (second right) attended the launch of the 2015-16 Liverpool kit at Anfield on Friday afternoon . There was a large turnout for the launch of the new kit,\u00a0which will be worn throughout the 2015-16 season . On the The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: \u2018Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' However Sterling is not the first England international to be caught indulging himself in the increasingly popular fad. Jack Wilshere became embroiled in his third smoking controversy in 15 months after a picture emerged of the Arsenal midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub in February. The 23-year-old was recovering from ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during a defeat by Manchester United in November last year. Choosing to keep his disciplinary plans private at the time of Wilshere's misdemeanour, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger was clear about his views on players that choose inhale potentially harmful substances. England and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) was involved in a smoking controversy back in February . 'I disagree completely with that behaviour,' the Frenchman said. 'When you're a football player you are an example and as well you don't do what damages your health. 'When you go out socially [and smoke] you as well damage your reputation as an example.' Depending on the result in the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon, Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates could close the gap between themselves and fourth placed Manchester City to four points if the Blues fall to their local rivals and if they defeat Newcastle on Monday.",

Jamie Jewitt, 24,\u00a0and Henry Rogers, 22, both admit that when they were in their teens, their self-esteem was at rock bottom. Henry, from Ealing, reached eighteen stone at his heaviest.\u00a0Before he made his foray into modelling, Henry, 22, was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. Scroll down for video . Henry Rogers, 22, hit 18st at his heaviest, left, but went on an intense two-year diet, including going vegan for a year, and now he's a sought-after model, right . At this point, he was keen to pursue a career in rugby, which was his passion. However, after reaching 18st, he decided to embark on a strict diet and after shedding the pounds and slimming down to 12st, he landed a job at Abercrombie & Fitch, where he was scouted by top agency, Models 1. His best friend Jamie Jewitt, 24, from Essex,\u00a0weighed 15st before his 15th birthday. Jamie was so self-conscious with his looks, he barely posed for any photographs and has hardly any snaps from his teen years. Before he made his foray into modelling, left, Henry was a student and working part-time as an electronic salesman. After shedding the weight, he landed a job in Abercrombie & Fitch and his career sky-rocketed from there, right . The men are using their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the 'shame' around body image and insecurity amongst men . After two years of intense and solid training - which included following a strict vegan diet for a year - he shed the excess weight and now weighs 12st. After he shed the weight, his family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked. The first casting was unsuccessful and he focused on his education. But fearing that he'd feel defeated, his parents encouraged him to go to a second casting. He was successful and moved out to New York alone to pursue his career in modelling. Despite initial setbacks, the pair  have since fronted campaigns for Tom Ford, Armani, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana.

The duo have even ventured into the world of reality TV, starring on New York's answer to Made In Chelsea, Taking New York. The boys have, however, left the show to focus on their modelling careers. And now, they say they want to use their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the \u2019shame\u2019 around \u2018body image\u2019 and \u2018insecurity\u2019 amongst men. So why do some men struggle to talk about body insecurities? Jamie and Henry think it is a 'masculine thing'. Discussing the topic, Jamie said: 'This year we have seen women leading the way. The likes of the Spice Girls encouraged the \"feel good\" movement. They encouraged women coming together and celebrating \"body beautiful\". 'But, for men, we are all too cowardly to talk about body image and insecurities. Even though we are all feeling it, we are not having those discussions down the gym. You don\u2019t want to be that guy that gets a tough time from your mates for talking out. It is silly really.' After he shed the weight, Jamie's family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked - and he managed to get spotted and now stars in the biggest designer's campaigns . The pair want to use their newfound platform for the better and are getting set to promote healthy male body image in a photoshoot with Attitude/Ateen coming out in June . Henry added: 'For some reason men don\u2019t feel like they can admit that they are insecure about their looks, that they don\u2019t feel the same pressures that women do. But with all the women paving the way for us and speaking out so confidently about their insecurities, we thought, why not admit to the world that we\u2019re not always comfortable in our skin either. 'Where are the male celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? There aren\u2019t any. Where are the female celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? Everywhere. 'From Pink to Kelly Clarkson. Women are out there talking loud and proud. We are letting the side down.'

But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video . Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant . Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom . The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail . An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna . Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations . This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in . Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations . 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at \u00a33.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'",

The 24-year-old Belgian has scored 18 goals across all competitions for his club this season, helping the Blues win the Capital One Cup and putting them on the brink of a first Premier League title since 2010. He was rewarded for his sterling performances with the top individual award of the night at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. Victory in their next two games - at Leicester and at home to Crystal Palace - would see Chelsea wrap up the championship. Eden Hazard poses with the PFA trophy after winning the award with a superb season in a Chelsea shirt . The 24-year-old Belgian poses with the trophy after collecting the gong at a glittering award ceremony at London's Grosvenor Hotel .

Didier Drogba posted this picture on Instagram  of Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Hazard, John Terry and Cesc Fabregas . John Terry posted this photograph with Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and Gary Cahill at the PFA Awards ceremony . Hazard has remarkably won Player of the Year or Young Player of the Year every season since 2009 with Lille or Chelsea. Hazard said of his award success: 'I'm very happy. One day I want to be the best and what I did this season is play very well, Chelsea played very well. 'I don't know if I deserve to win but it is good for me. 'It is good, it is better to be voted by the players - they know everything about football. This is good. I'm very happy.' He took the Young Player of the Year prize 12 months ago, and has rapidly progressed to the top award. 'We are almost champions, maybe this is the key,' said Hazard. 'Last season we finished third and this season we have an opportunity to win the league. This has changed from last season. 'I continue like I did last season - I try to be the same. I try to score more goals than last season. Personally I have played a good season, I have been there in the big games and I scored a lot of important goals, this is why I'm better this season.'

He picked out that moment as one of his best of the campaign. Asked to describe his season in a single word, Hazard struggled. 'I don't want to say 'amazing' because it is not finished yet - maybe amazing!' he said.

Hazard is embraced by team-mates after giving Chelsea the lead against Arsenal in October . Hazard has already won silverware this season, with the brilliant Belgian clutching the Capital One Cup with countryman Thibaut Courtois . Hazard (front) skips past the challenge of Manchester United's Wayne Rooney as the Chelsea man launches another attack . Mourinho has long sung the praises of the 24-year-old, believing he is rivalled by only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the global order. 'I had lots of stars, but he is the humble star,' the Portuguese said last weekend. 'He knows that he is one of the three best players in the world, the responsibility that comes (with that) and he is coping with that responsibility. 'He understands that his talent is fundamental for the team.' Hazard was earlier on Sunday named in the PFA Premier League team of the year - for the third time in his three seasons in England. He was one of six Blues players in the XI, along with captain John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa. The PFA Premier League Team of the Year for the 2014-15 season was announced ahead of Hazard being named Player of the Year . Hazard has benefited from working with Mourinho, with the Portuguese coach adding grit to his naturally flamboyant game . Ivanovic, though, was in no doubt as to the team's most influential cog. The Serbia defender, speaking about Hazard last week, said: 'He has been our most important player since day one. 'He is the guy who you just have to give the ball and he will do everything. 'Sometimes he looks so impressive, like he is not from this world.' Hazard arrived at Stamford Bridge in June 2012 - having been crowned Ligue 1 player of the year in each of his final two campaigns with Lille - for a fee reportedly around \u00a332million. Tottenham's Harry Kane - the only English attacking player in the team of the season - took the 2014/15 Young Player of the Year award. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a remarkable rise to stardom, scoring 30 goals for Spurs in all competitions this term despite not being given a regular starting slot until November. He helped Mauricio Pochettino's men to the Capital One Cup final, and also scored 79 seconds into his senior England debut as a substitute in the 4-0 European Championship qualifying victory over Lithuania at Wembley last month. Elsewhere, Ji So-yun of Chelsea Ladies won the\u00a0PFA Women's Player of the Year, while\u00a0Leah Williamson of Arsenal Ladies won the PFA Women's Young Player of the Year. Harry Kane capped a tremendous breakout season by walking away with the Young Player of the Year award . Kane's fairytale season featured a goal at Wembley on his England debut, just seconds after coming on against Lithuania . Kane was only handed a starting spot by Spurs in November, with the 21-year-old hitting 30 goals in all competitions this season .

Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 . The high point of Burnley's season, so far, is the 1-0 defeat of defending champions Manchester City .",

Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry has been banned from driving after he was caught drunk at the wheel of his Ford Focus. Hendry, 49, rowed with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder before embarking on a drinking session which led to him driving through Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, where he was seen speeding, a court heard. Police followed his 10-year-old car as it crossed double white lines while the father-of-four attempted to drive home. Now the former Premier League player who had spells with Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City, must travel around on his bike, a court heard. Hendry of  Lytham St Annes, admitted drink driving on the town's Church Road on February 21. He was almost twice over the legal limit after drinking in a Lytham cocktail bar. His lawyer Gwyn Lewis told Blackpool Magistrates' Court that Hendry's current income was 'meagre' and he asked for extra time for his client to pay fines and costs until he can start taking his offshore pension in mid May. Mr Lewis said Hendry, who is out of work, no longer wished to pursue a defence of 'special reasons' as a forensic report revealed he would have been over the limit at the time he was breath tested and there was no evidence that his drinks had been spiked. Peter Bardsley, prosecuting, said that a police officer in an unmarked car saw Hendry at 1am pulling away from a junction at speed. He followed Hendry who drove above a 20mph limit and then a 30mph limit sometimes going as fast as 50mph. The officer ordered Hendry's car to stop and smelled alcohol on him. He was arrested and a breath test revealed 63 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath. The legal limit is 35. The court heard Hendy, who played for Blackburn Rover and Manchester City, was seen driving at up to 50mph while drunk after a row with his then girlfriend Sarah Kinder . Argument: Hendry said he had rowed with Sarah Kinder, pictured. He has subsequently been arrested for allegedly breaking a restraining order . Mr Lewis said: 'Mr Hendry is a fit man and regularly cycles. He has not drunk for seven weeks before he was arrested. Playing career: Hendry captained Scotland and played for Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, and Rangers . 'He started what some people call a dry January following the death of his wife in 2009.' 'However he was in an emotional state that day-and he decided to take a drink. However he knows what he drank and still cannot accept the reading from the breath test.' 'His finances are to say the least complicated. He was made bankrupt some years ago. His income is meagre until he can start taking his pension in mid-May.' Chair of the Bench Marilyn Padgett banned Hendry for 17 months. He was also offered a drink drivers' rehabilitation scheme which will reduce his ban by one third if he completes it. He was fined \u00a3110 and the magistrate said: 'We have based this on the lowest level and it will be deferred for six weeks to allow you to start your pension.' He was ordered to pay \u00a3200 court costs and \u00a320 victims' surcharge. In 2010, Hendry was made bankrupt owing \u00a32.2m to friends, family and the taxman. Last weekend he was arrested after allegedly breaking a restraining order which forbids him from contacting his beauty technician former girlfriend Ms Kinder.

The veteran host was attempting to warm up the studio audience ahead of his show on Monday when he made the off-colour gag. Letterman had just opened up questions to the floor, and fielded the first query of the night from a college employee, reported the\u00a0New York Post. They asked what advice the scandal-hit comic would give to this year's graduates. Letterman, who was in 2009 forced to admit to string of affairs, said:\u00a0'Treat a lady like a wh\u2013e, and a wh\u2013e like a lady.' But the joke received a frosty\u00a0reception from the shocked crowd. After being met with stunned silence, the host attempted to recover by offering further advice to graduates to 'eat salad' and 'always be nice'. However, several audience members at the Ed Sullivan Theater were furious over the sexist joke. Retired Jerry Stockton, from Virginia, called it 'disrespectful to women' while another, who would not be named, said it had been an 'odd choice' for the first joke of the evening. The gag is thought to have been a reference to a saying by 1930s screenwriter Wilson Mizner. Scroll down for video . Joe Logan, 41, from Pennsylvania, told the New York Post:\u00a0'Younger people watch his show. We already live in a culture that objectifies women, it's not right to make a joke like that.' A Letterman spokesman said he could not 'confirm the accuracy' of Monday's failed joke and would not comment further. But a source close to the show insisted 'It got a big laugh.' Letterman carried on with the show which had guests including John Travolta and Amy Schumer, star of her eponymous Comedy Central show, 'Inside Amy Schumer.' Old friends: David thanked John for being his friend over the decades during Monday's show. It was during a Monday warm up that he made the gag . The Grease actor, 61, had tried to bring his son Ben on to meet his 'old friend' Letterman but the nervous youngster had fled the stage into his mother's arms. The host later offered some advice to Schumer and instructed her to 'do something now that you'll regret.' So the comedienne immediately lifted her dress and flashed... her surfing scar to a relieved-looking Letterman. In October 2009, the veteran host of the Late Show had been forced to admit to a string of affairs live on air  by a blackmailing producer. The host made the shocking revelation on his show that he had cheated on his wife, Regina Lasko, whom he had only married that March. He made the confession after becoming the victim of an extortion plot concocted by a then-CBS producer, Robert Halderman, who demanded $2 million in exchange for his silence over the affairs. Letterman is now planning to retire from the show after more than 20 years of hosting on May 20. Good times: David rubbed his forehead while Amy cracked up after he told her to do something she'd regret .",

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Vesnina have all been picked for Russian, with captain Anastasia Myskina now having to find a replacement for Sharapova. Myskina, who won the French Open in 2004, said she had been in constant contact with the Russian number one. 'Over the last few days, I have spoken with Maria and her team a lot,' Myskina said. 'Unfortunately her condition will not allow her to play for the national team. Maria did everything she could to try and play in Sochi. However, at the moment, she just isn't ready.

Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now. Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come. It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a \"revolution\") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe. They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape. We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided. The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed. And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official. That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden. \"If something serious isn't done,\" he warns, \"dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand.\" Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program. Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants. \"Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated,\" she recalled. \"Let's keep that in mind.\" Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home. That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort. And while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.",

The episode of An Hour with Ruta, which aired on independent TV channel LNK last week,\u00a0claimed that foreign children were being seized and fostered with Norwegian parents to strengthen the Nordic country's 'genetic material.' An introduction to the chat show argued that\u00a0Norway's Child Protection Service (Barnevernet) argued that it was deliberately targeting Lithuanian children which were seen as a 'sought-after commodity'. Lithuanian talk show An Hour with Ruta (pictured) has accused Norway of stealing their children in an attempt to tackle 'the highest rate of inbreeding in the world' It stated that 'In Norway, Lithuanian children are taken away from their parents.' An 'expert' on the controversial service told show host R\u016bta Mikelkevi\u010di\u016bte that the country needed fresh blood to combat its rates of inbreeding which she said had led to high rates of babies being born with birth defects. Neringa Ozolina, a Lithuanian based in \u00c5lesund, said:\u00a0'The birth rate is the lowest in Norway,' according to a report by\u00a0The Local. Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gra\u017eina Le\u0161\u010dinskiene (pictured) hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service . 'Inbreeding in Norway is the greatest in the world, and the same is true of the percentage of children born with Down syndrome and other birth defects.' Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gra\u017eina Le\u0161\u010dinskiene hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service. She claimed he had been taken from her after displaying what was deemed to be 'sexualised behaviour', which included frequent visits to the toilet and sniffing his hands. Dag Malmer Halvorsen, Norwegian Ambassador to Lithuania was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations form to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime . She is still fighting to have her son returned to her. Norway's Ambassador to Lithuania Dag Halvorsen admitted the issue of children being taken into care from foreign parents living in the Nordic country was a major concern in Lithuania. The problem is so widespread that Mr Halvorsen was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations firm to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime. 'It is said that there is a history of inbreeding in Norway and that there is a high incidence of Down syndrome among Norwegian children,' he told Norway's NRK channel. 'They argue therefore that it is important for Norwegian authorities to obtain fresh, foreign children, such as Lithuanian ones, to strengthen the genetic material.' Earlier this year Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman accused the services of acting 'like the Nazis' by not allowing a Czech mother of the two seized boys to talk to them in Czech. Russian authorities have also attacked Norway over its seizure of children from their Russian-speaking families.",

Analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the Home Counties. The potential goldmine in the Weald Basin, across Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, could meet up to a third of Britain\u2019s oil demand within 15 years, according to the consortium exploring the area. Scroll down for video . UK Oil & Gas Investments say they have discovered 100billion barrels worth of oil reserves in the Weald Basin, near Gatwick airport (pictured, the well head at Horse Hill) A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . This could reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia and could be a major boost for British industry at a time when the North Sea supply is dwindling. But industry experts remained sceptical of the claims, with one describing them as \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. Since 1975, of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the UK North Sea, only 45billion have been pumped out. It is believed another 20billion barrels can be recovered before extraction becomes too difficult. Experts warned last night that only a fraction of the Weald Basin oil may be accessible for extraction. They also claimed fracking could be required to retrieve significant volumes. Stephen Sanderson, the chief executive of UKOG, said the site at Horse Hill was 'world class' and had the potential for 'significant daily oil production' at this proposed drilling site . Horse Hill Developments consortium made the discovery during test drilling in a well five miles from Gatwick Airport. UK Oil & Gas Investments, which has a 30 per cent stake, said \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile \u2013 equating to 100billion barrels across the basin. At current crude prices, this could be worth \u00a33.7trillion. Stephen Sanderson of UKOG, which insisted it would not use fracking, said: \u2018By 2030, we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the UK\u2019s oil demand from within the Weald area.\u2019 Neil Ritson, of fellow consortium firm Solo Oil, said it was of \u2018major economic significance\u2019. If flow tests showed oil could be extracted, the production process could begin within 18 months, he added. US firm Nutech, which conducted the tests, estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted \u2013 up to 15billion barrels. UKOG chairman David Lenigas said drilling in the Weald could create \u2018many thousands\u2019 of jobs. Although the exploration site covered 55 square miles out of 1,100, he said the consortium was confident the entire region was oil-rich. Works: The well is situated in this container on the proposed drilling site . Exploration: Experts are now trying to work out how much of the oil will be properly recoverable . Mr Lenigas dismissed suggestions it would be hard to extract from the site, saying the ground was limestone which acted \u2018like a big sponge\u2019 and that \u2018you can effectively suck the oil out\u2019. The Australian entrepreneur, who lives in Monaco, is a director of 16 British companies \u2013 and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices. UKOG shares soared after the firm claimed to have discovered a \u2018world-class potential resource\u2019. However, Professor Alastair Fraser, of Imperial College London, said the claims were \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. A study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region, while the British Geological Survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil. Discovery: The Horse Hill site near Gatwick in Sussex, where a large amount of oil has apparently been found . Drilling: Exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile . Development: The site is owned by a number of companies including UK Oil & Gas Investments . The professor added: \u2018The question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so.\u2019 Malcolm Graham-Wood, of oil consultants HydroCarbon Capital, suggested residents might object to rows of onshore oil wells, adding: \u2018The question is can it produce oil? It is extremely difficult with a very low recovery rate. This is potentially interesting but I wouldn\u2019t attribute any value yet.\u2019 But Mr Lenigas said: \u2018To all those people who say I am hiking up the share price, I am not. I am just saying what the Nutech report says \u2026 I feel passionate that this is globally significant for Britain.\u2019 A Department of Energy & Climate Change spokesman said: \u2018The Government welcomes any new information which expands our understanding of the potential of the Weald Basin.\u2019 There might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the Home Counties \u2013 but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits. The Government owns the land under your house \u2013 meaning homeowners have no right to any oil found beneath them. Once oil has been found, oil companies pay the Government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits. The Government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted. The only way an oil company would pay the surface landowner is if it wanted to base its drilling site on their land. However, firms that undertake fracking, which is seen as a more intrusive and controversial method of extracting oil than simply drilling, must sometimes agree to provide \u2018community benefits\u2019. This could include building a playground or school nearby the fracking site, and is seen as compensation for residents. Oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area, as well as gaining planning permission from the local council. Oil rush: The Weald Basin, of which Horse Hill is part, could contain a total of 100billion barrels . Mystery: It is not yet known how much of the area's oil will be easily recoverable . Boom: The Sussex countryside could soon be dotted with oil wells (file photo)",

The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday overwhelmingly passed the latest version of a bill known as the USA Freedom Act by a bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. The measure seeks to codify President Barack Obama's proposal to end the NSA's collection of domestic calling records.  It would allow the agency to request certain records held by the telephone companies under a court order in terrorism investigations. The authority to collect those records and other related surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act will expire June 1 unless Congress passes a law reauthorizing it.\u00a0The House bill would do that, with changes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . UNHOLY TRIUMVIRATE? CIA Director John Brennan (center), National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers (right) and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (left) will soon be handed new rules of the road for mass-surveillance efforts . REMEMBER ME? NSA leaker Edward Snowden is still taking refuge outside the US, nearly two years after exposing the depth of the agency's eavesdropping program . Republican Representatives Bob Goodlatte and Jim . Sensenbrenner, and Democrats John Conyers and Jerry Nadler . introduced the 'USA Freedom Act.' It would result in phone companies, not the NSA, collecting so-called 'metadata' on trillions of phone calls. Government agencies could get access to it by applying to a judge empowered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Similar legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by . Democrat Patrick Leahy and Republican Mike Lee. But Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch . McConnell is seemingly out of phase, sponsoring his own bill to extend the PATRIOT Act \u2013 unchanged \u2013 until the end of 2020. McConnell said he intended his bill to be a starting point for legislative debate, not a complete solution. A similar bill to the one that cleared the Judiciary Committee passed the full House last year by a bipartisan vote of 303 to 121 but narrowly failed a procedural vote in the Senate. The Judiciary Committee chairman, Virginia Republican Rep.  Bob Goodlatte, said the bill's provisions had been carefully negotiated with both the intelligence committee and intelligence agencies. During the hearing, lawmakers said a deal had been reached to bring the USA Freedom Act to the floor without going through the intelligence committee, where many Republicans support continuing the NSA bulk collection. The NSA's collection and storage of U.S. 'to and from' landline calling records \u2013 times, dates and numbers, but not content of the calls \u2013 was the most controversial program among many disclosed by former NSA systems administrator Edward Snowden. CONTRARIAN: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is trying to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act without changes . Some NSA officials opposed the program, and independent evaluations have found it of limited value as a counterterrorism tool. Goodlatte said the House bill would create a 'narrower, targeted program,' that will still allow the NSA to hunt for connections between foreign terrorists and U.S. residents. 'We must act decisively to end bulk collection in the United States,' said Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat, in an Associated Press interview. 'For years, the NSA has collected our phone records, yet it cannot point to a single attack that the collection has stopped,' added Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who was one of the Patriot Act's original authors. Some lawmakers offered amendments they said would toughen the bill's civil liberties provisions, but those were voted down, with other lawmakers saying they would kill the deal and empower those who want to continue NSA phone records collection. A civil liberties group praised the bill. 'The USA Freedom Act of 2015 offers an effective path forward in reforming overbroad domestic surveillance and putting an end to the bulk collection of Americans' communications,' said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, in a statement.",

Nobody is expected to win a majority when votes are cast on May 7 in what is being touted as the closest and most unpredictable race since the 1970s. Prime Minister David Cameron, of the Conservatives, narrowly topped the polls assessing who 'won' the two-hour clash against six other parties in an unusual format for Britain. Crucially, 33 per cent of the 7.4 million viewers hailed Cameron as 'the most impressive' on the subject of the economy, which lies at the heart of each party's campaign. But pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be Cameron or the Labour Party's Ed Miliband who takes the top job in an inevitable coalition after votes are cast. Scroll down for video . The build-up: Prime Minister David Cameron went head-to-head with six other party leaders in a TV debate on Thursday night in an unusual format for Britain. It comes six weeks ahead of the general election on May 7 . Neck-and-neck: Cameron was hailed as statesmanlike in the debate as he tries to edge out Miliband (right) Nicola Sturgeon, of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), was widely touted as one of the victors in the debate, which also featured the environment-focused Green Party, led by Natalie Bennett, and Wales' Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Nigel Farage of the UK Independence Party completed the line-up. Analysts remarked that none of the leaders managed to deliver a 'killer line' that would set them apart from the other participants. 'There was clearly no knock-out blow,' said Peter Kellner of pollster YouGov. Jonny Tudor, 17, who asked one of the questions on the night, said afterwards: 'Some performed well in answer to certain questions, other performed well on different subjects, but there was no definitive winner.' A rare moment of drama came when a female audience member briefly interrupted Cameron to complain about the number of homeless people sleeping in the streets. Too close to call? Pollsters refuse to predict whether it will be the Labour Party's Ed Miliband (left) or David Cameron (right) in the top job after votes are cast. But polls named Cameron as last night's debate 'winner' Range: Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, was touted as one of the victors. Analysts remarked that none of the seven leaders delivered a 'killer line' to stand out from the rest . Rare moment of drama: A woman stood up during the debate to heckle Cameron about homelessness . But in a result that will calm Conservative nerves, a Comres/ITV poll showed 40 per cent of voters asked afterwards judged Cameron was the most capable of leading Britain, compared to 28 per cent who named Miliband. The event was the first and only full TV debate of a campaign that has yet to stir voters, many of whom say they feel jaded despite a rising economy. It is the only time Cameron and Miliband will go head-to-head on issues of policy before votes are cast. In one of Cameron's more animated moments in an otherwise reserved performance, he pointed to his rivals, one-by-one, and said: 'What I'm hearing is more debt and more taxes, more debt and more taxes, a lot more debt and more taxes, some more debt and more taxes, and definitely more debt and more taxes.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was forced to reference mistakes he made in the last five years in coalition .

The Italian-inspired mansion, which has incredible 360-degree views across the mountains, has now gone on the market for a tidy $29.5 million. Homeowner Dick Rothkopf, a former toy company chief, chose the location for the estate in 2008 because his family enjoyed hiking in the nearby hills. But the property is so remote that it took two years, a team of engineers and $1 million to build the 1.5-mile driveway from the roadway to its front door, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal reported. Incredible: This Italian-inspired mansion in the mountains of Vail, Colorado has gone on sale for $29.5 million . Stunning: The home, which was built in 2008, is made from materials brought over from the homeowner's trips to Italy . Spacious: Inside the 13,000-square-foot home is a spacious gourmet kitchen, which is perfect for entertaining guests . Opulent: The entire property has eight bedrooms and eight full bathrooms over two buildings, as well as an outdoor barn . European: The luxurious home is known as 'Il Podere' - which means 'family homestead' in the Tuscan region . No details were spared at the 17,000-square-foot estate itself, either. The home, which is known as 'Il Podere' - meaning 'family homestead' - was built on 230 acres of land using\u00a0materials collected during the Rothkopfs' trips to Italy. It features a main residence with seven bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, three half bathrooms, an elevator and a gourmet kitchen across 13,000 square foot. There's also a billiard room,\u00a0a gym, an indoor basketball court and a home theater. Outside is a pool with a spa and sauna, a pool house, a two-car garage and a tennis court, as well as a lake, a pond, a stream and stunning views. Comfortable: A massive fireplace in a living room offers comfortable nights in for humans and pets alike . Hidden: Beneath arches and down walkways are recreation rooms for both children and adults . Airy: Large windows and terraces give terrific views across the Vail Valley in Colorado . Beautiful: As well as an office, the main home has seven bedrooms and seven full bathrooms . Fully equipped: A large gym can also be found at the home, as well as a spa and a sauna . Luxury: There is a movie theater inside the home, as well as a billiard room and an indoor basketball court . Serene: The home is 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes and less than two hours from Aspen . Picturesque: The family who built the property chose this spot in Vail because they enjoyed hiking there . There is also a 2,000-square-foot caretaker's house, with one bedroom and one-and-a-half bathrooms, while a separate barn also houses a loft and a bathroom. And if the home itself doesn't offer enough entertainment, it's just 25 minutes from Vail's ski slopes,\u00a0an hour and 45 minutes from Aspen and two hours from Denver. The listing with Douglas Elliman\u00a0calls the estate 'breathtakingly beautiful, tranquil, pristine'. The family is leaving to build a home in Sonoma, California but plans to buy a smaller place in Vail so they can still make use of its slopes. Large: As well as a separate building for a caretaker, the estate also has a barn with a loft and a bathroom . Determined: Its current owners were intent on living at the location so built a $1 million to the house . Vistas: A swimming pool and terrace area gives unobstructed views across the valley . Restful: There is also a spa and a sauna at the home, as well as a separate one-bedroom caretaker's house . Great outdoors: The estate, which also has a stream and pond, stretches across nearly 17,000 square foot .

Sheila Secker, 78, had been given the pay-as-you-go phone by her son, but as she had not used the phone for some time it had been cut off. When the grandmother collapsed in her home in December, she could not contact her family and died in hospital a few days later, the Sunday Times reports. Cancelled: As Sheila Secker had not used her pay-as-you-go phone for any chargeable services, Vodafone retired her number without warning . Mrs Secker's son Steve told the newspaper how his mother had owned the mobile phone for 14 years, and recently topped up the credit, but had not made any calls. Shortly before her fall, Mrs Secker moved into a new home, near York, and had yet to have a landline installed, so relied on her mobile. Mr Secker told the Sunday Times' Money section how the family raised the alarm the next day after not hearing from his mother, and emergency services were called. Mrs Secker died in hospital on New Year's Day. When Mr Secker contacted Vodafone he was told his mother's number had been retired, and that a 'glitch' in the system had allowed the elderly woman to continue to 'top up' her credit. Take heed: Most major mobile phone operators regularly 'recycle' numbers when they have been out of use for a three to six months . 'What I cannot fathom is, if Vodafone has retired a number, how can it permit money to be taken as a top-up,' Mr Secker, 46, told the Sunday Times. 'This is nothing more than a rip-off to add insult to injury'. Most major phone operators regularly 'recycle' phone numbers when they have been out of use for a certain time. A Vodafone pay-as-you-go mobile is put into 'semi-quarantine' if no chargeable calls or texts are made for 90 days. After a\u00a0further\u00a090 days the number is disconnected, and 270 days later the number is recycled and given to another customer, with any credit on the phone lost. EE retires a pay-as-you-go number after 180 days of inactivity and O2 disconnects a pay-as-you-go phone after six months of no chargeable services. Tesco Mobile allows six months of inactivity before sending the customer a text to remind them to use their phone again, or their number will be lost.",

Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, is facing extradition and is wanted by American prosecutors after allegedly causing the 2010 Wall Street 'flash crash' and making more than \u00a326 million using a fraudulent trading technique. Sarao, of Hounslow, west London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday and was bailed with a surety of \u00a35 million. Suspected rogue trader Navinder Sarao (circled) lived in his parents' modest home because it gave him a split-second advantage worth millions of pounds . Sarao (pictured in court) spent a third night in custody last night after failing to pay the \u00a35million surety demanded by the courts to grant him bail . However, he has remained behind bars since his brief appearance, and will remain there over the weekend after an official from the magistrates' court today said it had not received the money. The spokeswoman said: 'It hasn't been paid and it can't be paid over the weekend. He will therefore remain in custody until at least Monday when he is able to pay the money.' The former Brunel University student allegedly made \u00a3550,000 in five minutes on the day of the 'Flash Crash', the biggest one-day collapse in Wall Street history. He is accused of using computer programs to create 'spoof' transactions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and faces charges which could carry a 380-year prison sentence. It's claimed he did all this from his parents' semi-detached home in Hounslow, west London, where he ran his one man trading company. He was arrested at the address on Tuesday afternoon at the request of American prosecutors. Under bail conditions he will be tagged and he has surrendered his passport and must live at the family home - keeping to a curfew of between 11pm and 4am at that address. His parents have also agreed to surrender their passports as part of the bail conditions. A full extradition hearing for Sarao has been set for August 18th and 19th, with a preliminary hearing on May 26th. Sarao's family's semi-detached house in suburban west London (pictured), from where he traded . After his arrest earlier this week made headlines across the world, details of his life have been revealed by former colleagues. One of which told MailOnline today: 'He was a super human trader - we were in awe of his ability to make money. When he left Futex he took \u00a32.5million from his account with him. That was unheard of. 'We were all encouraged to set up offshore accounts. If he has as much money as people think then that's where it'll be.' He is said to have 'loved making money, not spending it', and friend told MailOnline he would make \u00a3250,000 a day trading. Despite his alleged wealth he would travel to work late so he could buy off-peak tickets, only have lunch if he could find cut price sandwiches and shunned drinking in pubs for pints of milk at his desk.

According to Ms Bartholomew, she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection. However the butcher who was working at the shop on Monday has hit back saying Ms Bartholomew is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night when she was buying a chicken for her and her Roosters star boyfriend Aidan Guerra to have for dinner . The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up. There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said. Ms Bartholomew claims the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi swore at her and told her to leave, but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude . The chicken (pictured in front of Aidan Guerra) was cooked by Ms Bartholomew as part of a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast . 'Another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash, and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own.' However, the butcher vehemently denies he called Ms Bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine. 'She's just a troublemaker,' the butcher told Daily Mail Australia.\u00a0'I was very slow and she started having a go at me.' Ms Bartholomew (pictured with Mr Guerra) said the butcher told her to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' But the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman (pictured) He told Daily Mail Australia that he's trying to fit into Australian life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in Bondi. Ms Bartholomew\u00a0claims the butcher then asked her 'Why don't you just go to a f***ing Aussie butcher'. 'She said I'm half Italian don't speak to me like that,' the butcher said.\u00a0'I said if you're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go.' 'It's a free country there's about eight butcher shops in Bondi,' he added. Ms Bartholomew (left) and the butcher both said she didn't end up paying for the chicken she and Mr Guerra (right) later ate . Ms Bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her. 'I said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to \"take it and f*** off\",' she claims. 'I think I was just the victim of racial abuse,' the young Bondi woman wrote in a heated Facebook post shortly afterwards. However the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage. 'She didn't even end up paying for the chicken, she got a free chicken,' he said. Ms Bartholomew told Daily Mail Australia 'I have never been to this particular butcher before.' 'I'm going to assume it wasn't me who he was really angry at, however I just happened to be in there at the time.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)An Arizona police chief on Wednesday supported an officer's decision to drive his car into an armed suspect, saying that although the move could have killed the suspect, deadly force was justified. Video of the incident, recorded February 19 by the dashboard cameras of two Marana police cars, shows one of the cars running into a suspect with who had a rifle in the city about a half hour from Tucson. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. The footage has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" The video has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used to detain the man. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force, Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several incidents there the day he was struck. At 6:45 a.m. on February 19, Valencia allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in Tucson with a metal object in his hand. Authorities said he was dressed only in his underwear. He was charged with theft. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure. Just after that he entered a home and stole a car, police said. Authorities said he drove to a Walmart in Marana, where he allegedly stole a .30-30 rifle and ammunition. He fled the store with Walmart employees in pursuit. Police encountered him in a business park walking down the road. An officer told him several times to drop the rifle, Lt. Tim Brunenkant with Marana police said in an email containing a timeline of events. Valencia, police said, walked away from the officer, turned a corner and stopped. Valencia pointed the rifle at the officer then walked away again toward a Coca-Cola bottling plant and another business. \"As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created,\" Brunenkant wrote. Brunenkant also said by phone that before Rapiejko's encounter with Valencia, the suspect had pointed the rifle at his head multiple times and threatened suicide before fleeing. Rozema said that Valencia's firing of the weapon, his refusal to obey the first officer's commands to drop the gun and the pointing of the gun at the officer were key. \"And so you have another officer who sees and seizes an opportunity to end the threat and put an end to the situation,\" the chief said. Cohen-Metzger criticized the fact that Rapiejko hit Valencia from behind. \"My client's back was turned and the officer drove right into him,\" she said. \"It isn't that dissimilar to a police officer shooting a fleeing suspect in the back.\" CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer.

The Tangerines' demotion into the third tier was finally confirmed on Easter Monday and that triggered pre-match public displays of fury from fans at the Oyston family's handling of the club on Tuesday. Dozens of supporters gathered outside the West Stand 45 minutes before kick-off and hurled eggs at the back of the directors' boxes before a flare, smoke bomb and firework were tossed into the cordoned-off area in front of the main reception area. Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead against Reading on Tuesday night . But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed . Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool . Blackpool: Lewis (Parish 73); Hall (Maher 50), Clarke, O'Dea, Dunne; Cubero, O'Hara, Perkins, Orlandi (Osavi-Samuel 78), Jacobs; Madine . Goal: O'Hara (pen, 6) Booked: O'Hara . Reading: Federici; Gunter, Pearce, Knight, Obita; McCleary (Mackie 45), Ake, Norwood, Robson-Kanu; Yakubu (Cox 78), Appiah (Pogrebnyak 45) Goal: Hall \u00a0(OG, 46) Ref: G. Eltringham . Att: 9,614 . With stewards and police present, the scenes did not descend into violence but the message delivered from those in attendance was clear - they want Oyston to depart a team that this week became the first in the Football League to be relegated. On the pitch, Jamie O'Hara's early penalty was cancelled out by Grant Hall's unfortunate own goal just 20 seconds after the restart as the basement-dwelling Seasiders' winless run was extended to 13 games. Some of the supporters who congregated in front of the West Stand did not even walk into a half-empty stadium for the game and they missed their side taking a sixth-minute lead. Zat Knight got the wrong side of Sheffield Wednesday loanee Gary Madine and tripped him from behind, allowing O'Hara to step up and stroke the resulting penalty into the corner as Adam Federici guessed the wrong way. Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family . Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading . A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests . The cut-up pitch arguably denied the hosts a second as the ball bobbled away from David Perkins, who had orchestrated a three-on-two break, on the edge of the Royals' penalty area. Winger Michael Jacobs then blasted into the side-netting from 25 yards as Blackpool entered the interval with a one-goal lead. That disappeared 20 seconds after the restart, though, when the Royals made a lightning start to the second period. Pavel Pogrebnyak made inroads down the left flank and he squared for Yakubu, whose shot back across goal smashed against the unfortunate Hall before going over the line. Hall stayed on the turf and after woozily returning to his feet, he was replaced by Niall Maher. Perkins bent an effort narrowly past a post but Joe Lewis and Federici remained largely untroubled, as did Blackpool substitute Elliot Parish when he replaced an injured Lewis, with Pogrebnyak's header off target the closest either side came to a winner. The result leaves Lee Clark's side on 25 points, still one point shy of the lowest points tally ever accumulated by a team in the second tier when there have been 24 teams competing.",

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr\u00a0Prasanna . \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,\u2019 he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: \u2018Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c . \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O\u2019Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll and\u00a0Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr\u00a0Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.",

Provisions including baby formula, food and medication were being being ferried to people who are stranded in Gilliston Heights, near Maitland. 'Patience is going to be a big part of the next few days and weeks,' the premier said. It will be a long time before storm-battered victims get back on their feet, he said. The SES has responded to more than 14,000 requests for assistance since Sunday. SES Commissioner Adam Dent urged bosses to remain flexible in coming days, despite the clearer skies. 'It's often when the rain stops and perhaps when less images are on TV that people take the focus away from our work, we still need to work for several days to come,' he said.

The shadow business secretary said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters. Mr Umunna's remarks come after Mr Farage dragged into a fresh racism storm after National Front members turned up to campaign for him in his South Thanet constituency. Scroll down for video . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Nigel Farage had 'a problem with race' following his remarks last about 'fully black' and 'half black' Ukip supporters . The row started after a group of far-Right supporters calling themselves the East Kent English Patriots supported Mr Farage at an event in Broadstairs on Friday evening. They were led by Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League, and enjoyed the protection of Ukip's security teams, which encircled the Broadstairs Pavilion. Mr Field, who has a criminal record for assault, drank beers behind the cordon with fellow members of his group and gestured to onlookers as a crowd waited for Mr Farage's arrival. The Ukip leader moved to disown the far-right campaigners, saying: 'Members of an extremist group today arrived at a Ukip public meeting at the same time as a Mail on Sunday camera arrives.' But Labour's Mr Umunna, whose father was born in Nigeria, accused Ukip of whipping up 'anti-immigration sentiment'. Mr Umunna said: 'The likes of Ukip don't like what modern Britain is. They claim to love Britain, but they hate modern Britain. If I'm wrong about that why do we see a stream of invective directed at different groups in society from their candidates and their members? 'There is a virus of racism which runs through that party which they've failed to deal with, and I'm not surprised given their leader doesn't see the need for equalities legislation that we have in Britain today and that we're very proud of.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage, stopping for a pint in Ramsgate, Kent, was accused of having a 'problem with race' Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League (pictured in the white hat)\u00a0turned up to campaign for Ukip in South Thanet constituency last week . Last week, Mr Farage defended Ukip's manifesto, which featured only one ethnic-minority person, saying the party had one spokesman who was 'fully black' and another who was 'half black'. Responding to these remarks, Mr Umunna said: 'I just think the guy's got a problem with race. I'm just saying what I think. 'As a party they've got a problem with race. And I don't think you can kick out racism from their party unless you have got a leadership which understands it and understands race in modern Britain. 'I have no truck with this notion that immigrants are to blame for all of the country's problems. We saw people do that to black and Asian people like my father in the Sixties and Seventies, and now the group they're trying to blame for all their problems are Eastern Europeans.'",

Richard Curry, from Loveclough in Lancashire, was told he had malignant melanoma in his septum, the thin strip which separates the nostrils. He was warned that he would have to have his nose removed to stop the cancer from spreading but could be fitted with a prosthetic. Pensioner Richard Curry, who wears a prosthetic nose attached to his face using magnets, after his own had to be removed when he was diagnosed with cancer . But in order to make sure that the new nose stayed in place, the 71-year-old then had to have magnetic implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity during a procedure at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. And now Mr Curry has spoken of his shock at how successful the operation has been of keeping his new nose in place. He said: 'Losing my nose was something of a shock but I didn't have much choice because this kind of cancer is one of the most dangerous you can get. The 71-yer-old had a procedure to have metal implants inserted into his cheekbones and nasal cavity in order to hold his prosthetic in place . 'I ws just grateful it was caught in time and removed, and when they mentioned they could attach a new one with magnets, I just thought it was amazing.' Mr Curry's nose was removed in 2013, after he spotted traces of blood in a tissue, and the implants were gradually inserted of the course of the next 12 months. He added: 'In the early days I wasn't quite sure how much adhesive to put on, and my stick-on nose would sometimes fall off in hot weater, for example. 'And there was an incident in Asda which gave the girl on the till a bit of a shock. 'The implants were all ready last September and I was so pleased with the results. 'It's comfortable and it looks good, and I've even still got my sense of smell. 'I just need to get it touched up for colour every now and then, like before going on holiday so it matches my skin.' Mr Curry, a retired civil servant, who lives with his partner James Rogerson now wears his new nose all day but removes it at night when he goes to bed. A check-up last month found no signs of the cancer returning when he met with prosthetist Tony Simpson, maxillofacial surgeon Gary Cousin and ear, nose and throat specialist Paddy Morar. Mr Morar said: 'Cancers of the nose are not that common at all, you probably only get one every three years or so, so this was a very unusual procedure. Mr Curry's prosthetic nose, which is held on by magnets. Specialist Paddy Morar says it is fairly common to use magnets to attach prosthetic ears, but was the first time they had used them to attach a nose . 'Magnets are used quite commonly with prosthetic ears, but this was the first time we had used them to attach a nose. 'Richard couldn't have radiotherapy so it had to be surgery and we were extremely impressed by his attitude throughout, he's a very strong character and a model patient.

The New York Post reported in addition to being stripped of his badge, Detective Patrick Cherry will be placed on modified duty before being transferred out of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. 'No good cop should watch that video without a wince,' NYPD Police Chief Bill Bratton said at a press conference announcing Cherry was being placed on modified duty. Scroll down for video . Screaming and raging: Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . 'Because all good cops know that officer just made their jobs a little bit harder,' Bratton added. 'In that kind of encounter, anger like that is unacceptable. In any encounter, discourtesy and obscene language like that is unacceptable.' The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau launched an investigation into the incident, which occurred in the West Village, after footage captured by a passenger was posted online. The officer was named by the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Shell shocked: The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . Detective Cherry was in plainclothes and trying to park his unmarked Hyundai without signalling when the Uber driver known only as\u00a0Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his driving ability. Cherry's case was transferred to the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said Cherry was returning from a visit with his colleague Detective Harry Hill. Hill had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and Cherry was reportedly very stressed. 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health,' Palladino said. 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts at the driver, screaming, 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that.' 'That's not the way it works,' he continued. 'How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai . 'Our Uber driver, Humayun, was abused by a police officer today in New York,' Sanjay Seth, who took the video, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. 'The unending rage, door slamming, throwing items into the car, threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer's remarks at the end really took it to another level.' 'The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident,' Uber said in a statement. 'We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs.'",

But not everyone was smiling after Sir Paul McCartney married Heather Mills. Take a closer look at Macca's wedding party picture and you'll spot his daughters Stella and Mary looking decidedly glum. Scroll down for video . The pair \u2013 daughters of Sir Paul's first wife Linda, who died of cancer four years previously \u2013 were said to have been less than overjoyed by their father's choice of partner. The remarkable picture is a portent of the bitterness that would follow the wedding in 2002 \u2013 as Sir Paul and Ms Mills separated in 2006 and went through a bitter and messy divorce in 2008. Astonishingly, the image is the first to emerge of the former Beatle and Ms Mills from their wedding reception. In another never-before-seen picture, Sir Paul acts out a mock striptease in front of his delighted bride during the reception, which was attended by 300 guests. Sir Paul, then 59, and Ms Mills had ordered a media blackout of the event in Ireland. These pictures belong to the family of Sir Paul's late housekeeper Rose Martin, who was among those invited to the event at the 17th Century Castle Leslie in County Monaghan. The ceremony was shrouded in such secrecy that on the invitations guests were told only to arrive at a hotel at Heathrow Airport at an appointed time from where they would be flown to an unnamed destination. Other guests included the only other surviving Beatle, Ringo Starr, the band's legendary producer Sir George Martin, Pretenders singer Chrissy Hynde, and model Twiggy. Sir Paul and Ms Mills are pictured (left) in 2003\u00a0at a screening for the film 'Concert For George' and (right) in\u00a0Hollywood in 2007 . The pair posed with photographer Dennis Stone (left) as they arrived back in London after a trip abroad . Sir Paul (left) and Ms Mills (right) went through a bitter and messy divorce in 2008 and are pictured leaving the High Court after one of their hearings . Mary (left) and Stella (right) McCartney join Sir Paul at the launch of Meet Free Monday seven years after his 2002 wedding . The couple turned down a \u00a31.5 million offer from Hello! magazine for exclusive photos of the event. One official portrait \u2013 of the couple outside the church \u2013 was published, for charity. These photos and other memorabilia, including the invitation \u2013 featuring Sir Paul giving Ms Mills a piggy-back \u2013 are being sold at Omega Auctions in Stockport, Cheshire, next month. Mrs Martin's family decided to sell them after her death aged 92 in 2013. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: 'They decided the best thing was to pass them on to fans.'",

Jim Ratcliffe, founder and chairman of chemical company Ineos, has applied to planning officials in the New Forest to seek to demolish an existing beach hut and replace it with a 'carbon neutral' mansion. The 62-year-old businessman who is based in Switzerland claims that the new house, if built, will be his only UK residence. The proposed beach house in this computer generated image would only be visible from yachts on the Solent . The high-tech planned mansion will be virtually 'carbon-zero' and uses renewable energy such as solar power . Billionaire tycoon Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a futuristic beach house on a site he owns overlooking the Solent . The planning application claims the building will be 'climate-change proof due to its jacking system. The building has been designed by Charles Morris, who was the architect responsible for the Orchard Room at Prince Charles's Highgrove Estate. According the document: 'The development proposals incorporate domestic-scale micro renewable energy systems, including an array of photovoltaic cells, solar hot water and an air source heat pump. 'The solar thermal hot water system provides hot water powered directly from the sun; the photovoltaic cells will provide electrictiy to power immersion heaters to ensure that there is hot water in all weather conditions. 'The air source heat pump will draw latent heat from the air even when air temperature is as low as -25C to heat the house via underfloor heating. 'The dwelling would be so thermally efficient and would harness so much renewable energy that it will not need a boiler. 'The dwelling has been designed to be lifted by 73 piston jacks, with with a capacity to lift 25 tonnes; this will allow the development to respond to rising sea levels over the next 100 years, this is truly innovative and truly unique.' Mr Ratcliffe is seeking to demolish the existing house on the site and replace it with the new mansion . The house has a revolutionary jacking system which can lift the property up in the case of flooding . The \u00a34million luxury mansion will have stunning views of the Isle of Wight and is at the edge of the New Forest . Mr Ratcliffe bought the site in 2005 and has had several previous planning applications rejected. According to the plans, the house would only be visible from yachts on the Solent. His neighbours include Dire Straits lead singer Mark Knopfler and the band's bass guitarist John Illsley who live either side of the planned development. Graham Baker of the New Forest Association told the Times: 'Mr Ratcliffe bough a beach house, a small cheaply built occasional dwelling. He wants to erect a mansion in its place.' Mr Baker claimed the planned jacking system is not sufficiently unique to allow planners to grant the house permission. However, neighbour Frank Woodward, 89, who lives 100 metres away from the beach house said: 'This area was flooded a few years ago so I think it's a good idea. There used to be a much bigger house on that site. 'Mr Ratcliffe has got the money. He has to have a big house. People who are objecting have only been living here for five minutes.'",

Mohammed Dahbi discriminated against actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer after ordering them to 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He warned that if they ignored his request during the trip on September 18, 2011, he would throw them out. Outraged: Mohammed Dahbi was accused of discrimination after ordering actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer to stop kissing and 'keep that behavior for the bedroom'. He was ordered to pay the couple $10,000 in fines . When they got out, Dahbi also called the pair 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away. He claimed during the city's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings\u00a0they were 'touching each other all over' and 'kissing heavily' . But according to DNAinfo New York, Judge John Spooner disagreed and ordered him to pay the fine. He also made him attend anti-discrimination training and pay a $5,000 civil penalty to the city. Ms Spitzer told the news website: 'We felt that what happened to us was wrong and he needed to take responsibility for his actions. The trip began at Columbus Circle when Ms Spizter climbed into the yellow cab with her dog and headed to pick Ms Thronton up in Chelsea, before heading to Sunset Park in Brooklyn. However, when they hit the Meatpacking District, Dahbi turned around and barked the orders at them. Verbal abuse: When the pair (pictured) got out, Dahbi also called them 'b*****', 'c****' and 'whores' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away . They said he was discriminating against them because they were gay, to which he replied: 'Don't make me out to be an a**hole.' They insist it was just a peck on the lips. Spizter told DNAinfo she knew this because she had just been to the dentist. She said: 'That\u2019s why I\u2019m so aware of what my behavior was in the taxi.' Dahbi's lawyer, Ali Najmi said he had never mentioned anything about the pair's sexuality and has a 'standard of decency'. They are now planning to appeal the decision. In a statement on his firm's website, he said: 'We will be pursuing an appeal of this decision. The Administrative Judge acted unreasonably and made conclusions of fact that cannot be substantiated based on the record. The fine amount is completely unfair given that there was no real injury here.'",

Insurers are dodging the rules that ban them from charging female drivers less by offering lower premiums to motorists who have jobs that are done mainly by women, he said. Stephen McDonald, of Newcastle University Business School, analysed this pay-by-job system. Sheilas' Wheels:\u00a0The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels . He found car insurance costs have plunged for young dental nurses and social workers, which are female-dominated roles. But insurers have pushed up bills for young drivers who have jobs that mean they are likely to be male, such as construction workers and civil engineers. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011, he said. But a 21-year-old plasterer or civil engineer is likely to be paying 13 per cent more. This difference in premiums based on occupation was not seen in older age groups, but only for young drivers \u2013 \u2018where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest\u2019, he explained. Dr McDonald, who presented his research to a Royal Economic Society conference, warned the same methods may be used by insurers when it comes to paying pensions. Someone who tells their insurer they are a 21-year-old dental nurse is likely to get car insurance for 10 per cent less than they would have done in 2011 . EU law bans them from giving more generous annuities to men, who don\u2019t usually live as long as women. But it does not prevent them from paying rates based on the jobs pensioners used to do. The gender equality rules, laid down by the EU Court of Justice, came into effect from December 2012. They meant that many car insurance firms had to change their pricing policies, including \u2018female-focused\u2019 insurers Sheilas\u2019 Wheels. Dr McDonald said: \u2018The ruling has been effective at stopping discrimination by gender. \u2018However, for young drivers, for whom the difference in risk between males and females is greatest, there is evidence that firms are engaging in indirect discrimination using occupations as a proxy for gender, with insurance prices becoming relatively lower for those in female-dominated jobs.\u2019 His report examined insurance premiums between November 2011 and November 2013 for people at four ages: 21, 25, 40 and 55. It looked at six professions: civil engineers and plasterers, who are nearly all men; solicitors and sports hall staff, who are roughly evenly split by sex; and social workers and dental nurses, who are mostly female. To make fair comparisons, the quotations were taken for people in the same area, Gosforth, in Newcastle. The cut in premiums for those in female-dominated jobs was \u2018not the case for the older ages\u2019, Dr McDonald said. \u2018It suggests that this is therefore only an issue in the riskiest segments of the motor insurance market and for those ages where the difference in expected claims between men and women is greatest.\u2019",

Madison County prosecutors filed paperwork in Circuit Court charging Geraldine Jones, 36, with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement\u00a0in the death of  Samantha Fleming, 23, of Anderson. Police Sgt Chad Boynton said Monday afternoon police had not yet been in contact with Jones, of Gary, who police say is being treated in Texas for depression. Scroll down for video . Geraldine Jones, 36, of Gary, Indiana, was charged with murder, kidnapping and criminal confinement . Samantha Fleming and her three-week old baby went missing from her home in Anderson, Indiana, on April 5 . Police believe Fleming, 23, was lured from her home by Jones and the new mother brought Serenity with her . Authorities in Texas have taken precautions to make sure Jones can't leave the hospital and Indiana police are hoping to begin extradition proceedings, Fox 59 reported. Sgt Boynton said:\u00a0'We are making preparations to initiate conversation just as soon as possible.' Fleming was living with her boyfriend, but disappeared with her three-week-old baby Serenity on April 5. Police investigating Fleming's disappearance on Friday found her body in Jones' home in Gary, about 165 miles northwest of Anderson. She had been stabbed, wrapped in plastic and soaked with bleach. When police arrived, Fleming's daughter was being held by Jones' sister, who told police she had been caring for her sister's child while her sister was in Texas. Police determined the child was Fleming's and the baby was returned to relatives in Indianapolis. Authorities say they believe Jones got Fleming to travel to northwest Indiana by telling her she worked for the Indiana Department of Child Services and she needed to attend a hearing. Serenity was being held by Jones' sister, who told police she had been caring for her sister's young child . A woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared saying she was with DCS and wanted information . Indiana State Personnel Department spokeswoman Ashley Emsweller Hungate said no one named Geraldine Jones or with the name of her sister has ever worked for DCS. Police believe Jones may have faked being pregnant, telling family she was expecting twins. Boynton said police don't know how the woman was able to convince Fleming she worked for DCS, but he said Fleming did have previous contact with DCS. He said: 'So therefore the ploy that the suspect used to get her to leave Anderson and head to Lake County may have been more believable in her mind.' Police say a woman called Fleming's mother before she disappeared and said she was with DCS and was seeking information about Fleming and her daughter. The body of Fleming was found stabbed, doused in bleach and wrapped in plastic inside this home in Gary . Authorities said the woman provided legitimate names of DCS employees and implied she was familiar with Fleming's case history. DCS spokesman James Wide said he couldn't comment on whether Fleming had a DCS case because of privacy laws. Wide said DCS is leaving the investigation into how the woman may have tricked Fleming into thinking she worked for DCS up to police. 'There's nothing internally being initiated from it, but we definitely will comply with law enforcement and help them where we can,' he said.",

According to the newspaper, if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James, with the second favourite name being Alexander. Many people are hoping for a girl though - of the 2,200 people polled, a quarter said they wanted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to have a female baby, with only three percent hoping for a younger brother for George. Diana is the favourite name for the second royal baby, name after Williams mother - the late Princess Of Wales .

Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley . Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track . For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track . Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''",

Mr Philp claimed he had no recollection of vandalising the car and that it was out of character for him. Magistrate Michael Quinn reminded him he had a number of similar convictions on his criminal record, but Mr Philp said these were a long time ago and he wanted to 'change things.' The Magistrate asked him: 'So you're working for good and not evil now?' to which Philp replied 'I am.' Mr Philp fronted Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday, where he pleaded guilty to wilful damage of police property .",

The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to \u00a330,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as\u00a0The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down. It was replaced by The Bristol Brewery Georges, which has since closed and been converted into flats. As it is today (right) Many uses: There was a builder, undertaker and joiner stationed at\u00a0Broad Quay Bristol when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855 . How Broad Quay Bristol looks now. It has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat . Little difference: The view through St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works . High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 . St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now . Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was\u00a0destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940.\u00a0Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed . Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol.\u00a0The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s . Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again . Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone . Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol. It is believed the set of pictures could fetch up to \u00a330,000 when they go up for auction tomorrow . This photo shows Host Street in Bristol. It provides a glimpse into the past as much of the historic city centre was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War .",

But they do leave their trash. Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. \"Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,\" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. \"We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,\" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. \"There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip.\" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing \"in an eco-sensitive manner,\" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.",

When Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on TV today to insist none of the country\u2019s troops are positioned in the Ukraine, he looked decidedly fresh-faced for a man accused of war-mongering. The wrinkles on the 62-year-old's forehead, clearly visibly in previous pictures, have disappeared, while his skin look smooth, taut, tanned and younger than ever. Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV today like you have never seen him before - leading to questions that he has had cosmetic surgery to get rid of the bags under his eyes, wrinkles and make his face more chiseled . His appearance this week is radically different to how he was previously pictured in 2007 (left) and 2010 (right). In both photographs the skin of Putin's face is more saggy, and he has visible dark circles under his eyes . And as this series of pictures show, the Russian president's face has changed dramatically over the years \u2013 amid persistent rumours he has undergone cosmetic surgery to give himself a more youthful look. A black and white picture taken in 1991 when he was 37 years old shows him looking gaunt, and black bags under his eyes are clearly visible. Putin, pictured in 1985 (left) with his wife Lyudmila and daughter Katya, and in 1991 (right) when he was chairman of the External Relations Committee of Saint Petersburg, aged 37. His hair was already receding . Pictures taken in 2000 (left) and 2001 (right), when Putin was in his forties, also show 'crow's-feet' on his eyes . During his first term at President in 2007 Putin, then aged 55, looked his age while still healthy . In a photo dated 2000, Putin\u2019s hair still has tones of blonde but the signs of ageing are becoming more apparent on his features. Fast-forward to 2010, and the 'action man', now 57, looks tired and haggared after taking part in a judo session . Questions over whether Putin had gone under the knife came to the fore in 2011, when the then-Prime Minister was photographed with a yellow bruise on his face. Russian media began to question whether Putin had had plastic surgery in 2011. Pictured here announcing his intentions to run to become the President of Russia, journalists wondered if that bid sparked the surgery . Putin's face was puffy but relatively wrinkle-free in December 2013 when he attended a conference in Moscow . Plastic surgeons at the time told MailOnline that Botox injections, a facelift, cheek-fillers, a brow lift and removal of the bags under his eyes would have helped improve his ageing features \u2013 although his spokesman denied at the time he had had any work done. But In the same year he announced he wanted to become the next President of Russia, leading commentators to ask if that was the reason behind his new look. In December 2013, after around two years in office as President, he looked vastly different again, his face puffy but wrinkle-free. And in March this year, the Kremlin was forced to deny rumours that he was unwell \u2013 or had undergone surgery \u2013 when the President disappeared for 10 days, cancelling a string of appointments and public appearances. Questions were raised about Putin's health when he met with the President of Kyrgystan last month after a 10 day disappearance. He refused to explain where he had been saying 'it would be boring without gossip' Putin, pictured on April 16 2014 - looking relaxed and youthful as he give a television interview about Ukraine . When he emerged to meet with the President of Kyrgystan\u00a0his face was puffy and shiny, and eyes only able to partially open, leading journalists to wonder about the cause of his new look. However Putin has remained tight-lipped about his absence, laughing off the suggestions of poor health - or rumours that he had been attending the birth of a love child - saying; 'It would be boring without gossip.' His latest appearance is unlikely to quell suggestions that Putin has been knocking on the doors of plastic surgeons. Putin was recently reported as saying he won't be in office past the year 2024, when he will turns 71 years old - although these pictures suggest there is a good chance he won't look it.",

Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained . A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, \"See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.\"' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting. Scott said he requested a parent-teacher conference, but Nancy Perry brought along her husband Bill, pictured above, who sites on the Board of Education. \u00a0The pair showed him what he described as anti-Obama internet propaganda . City schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter says school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on parent-teacher meetings . 'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.' Ledbetter also apologized for the actions of Perry's husband, who he said shouldn't have attended the parent-teacher conference. Ledbetter said school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on a parent-teacher meeting. 'See, Obama is a baby killer.

With just weeks until his box-office victory lap for \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" Joss Whedon is now facing a lawsuit accusing him of stealing the idea for the 2012 meta-horror movie The Cabin in the Woods. Whedon produced and co-wrote the script for Cabin with director Drew Goddard, a writer on Whedon's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and a fanboy favorite in his own right, with credits that include Netflix's \"Daredevil\" (and reportedly may soon include Sony's upcoming Spider-Man projects). Whedon and Goddard are named as defendants, along with Lionsgate and Whedon's Mutant Enemy production company, in the complaint filed Monday in California federal court. Joss Whedon Slams 'Jurassic World' Clip as \"'70s-Era Sexist\" In the complaint, Peter Gallagher (no, not that Peter Gallagher) claims Whedon and Goddard took the idea for \"The Cabin in the Woods\" from his 2006 novel \"The Little White Trip: A Night In the Pines.\" He's suing for copyright infringement and wants $10 million in damages. Gallagher is basing his claim on the works' similar premises: Both feature a group of young people terrorized by monsters while staying at a cabin in what is revealed to be (spoiler alert) a horror-film scenario designed by mysterious operators. Read the full complaint. Gallagher also alleges similarities between the characters' names and personalities -- his book's blond Julie and shy Dura and the film's Jules (Anna Hutchison) and Dana (Kristen Connolly), and handsome and scatterbrained men in both works -- and certain scenes involving the characters finding strange items in their respective cabins and discovering hidden cameras. 'Age of Ultron': Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch Are \"Massively Important,\" Says Joss Whedon (Video) In the complaint, Gallagher describes how he self-published the novel and \"began grassroots efforts\" to sell it on the Venice Beach boardwalk and on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. \"[The defendants] currently reside and operate out of Santa Monica, California, a short distance from where the Book was sold,\" the lawsuit claims. Gallagher alleges that he \"was contacted by multiple credited entertainment industry producers who expressed interest in the Book,\" but he doesn't specify Lionsgate or Mutant Enemy. A Lionsgate spokesman declined to comment. The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to representatives for Whedon and Goddard. \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nIf there's someone who isn't scared to show her colourful side in these times of taupe and elephant breathe, it is celebrated interior designer Abigail Ahern. Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I\u2019ve ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette \u2013 silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys \u2013 it\u2019s what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour',\u00a0come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don\u2019t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot\u2019s Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room \u2013 say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to\u00a0communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you\u2019ll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You\u2019ll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo \u2013 all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery \u2013 you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don\u2019t neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you\u2019ve made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

Before that, the Twilight saga managed $3.3 billion over five films from 2008. The Avengers garnered $1.5 billion with just one film in 2012, and there are three other sequels to come, with the follow-up hitting cinemas May 1. When it comes to Hollywood's primary concern - banking a major box office - a series or superhero adaptation is largely seen as a surefire success, in a benchmark set in the early 2000's by Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings, and followed by The Pirates Of The Caribbean and Spiderman. However, while original screenplays and independent projects are being edged out and overlooked as a result, there is still a small group of stars considered capable of pulling people into theaters in droves. According to a new survey in\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter - which called upon producers, agents and executives to list those who can command a major opening based on their fan base - \u00a0there are six superstars around that can keep the studios swelling, without having to resort to turning a best-selling book or beloved comic into a picture. In return, they can ask for $20 million per film. 1. Sandra Bullock . The acting favorite, who won an Oscar in 2010 for The Blind Side, topped Forbes' list of the highest-earning actresses in 2014. The Miss Congeniality star took the headline spot thanks to her gripping turn in Gravity, which became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2013, with a global box office of $716 million. And while her buddy cop comedy The Heat with Melissa McCarthy managed similarly impressive numbers, with about $229.9 million worldwide, the powerful pull that Bullock has today is a career-long achievement. Thrillers like Speed, A Time To Kill ,Murder By Numbers and Crash served her well, but Bullock's legion of loyal fans have really followed her quality comedies and dramas - from While You Were Sleeping to Hope Floats, Practical Magic, 28 Days, Two Weeks Notice and The Proposal. Theater favorite: Sandra Bullock has built up an impressive and loyal following over a career spanning almost 30 years. Here she is pictured in 2013's Gravity (left) and Speed in in 1994 (right) Old faithful: Bullock made her name - and continues to - by appearing in feel-good romantic comedies, such as Hope Floats with Harry Connick Jr. in 1998. In it Bullock plays a housewife who moves back to the small town she is from following the collapse of her marriage . 2. Leonardo DiCaprio . For a young guy who started out doing TV ads for Bubble Yum chewing gum in the 1990s, DiCaprio is now 40 and a bona fide movie star. While 1997's Titanic is still ranked as the second highest-grossing film of all time (after Avatar), taking $2.18 billion, he has appeared in some of the largest films of the last 15 years, including Inception, Django Unchained, The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, The Aviator and, most recently, The Wolf Of Wall St. According to The Richest, his films have grossed an astounding $2.3 billion. Mr blockbuster: Leonardo DiCaprio asked for $25 million up front to appear as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf Of Wall Street (left), according to reports. His is pictured out and about in New York in September 2014 (right) 3. Matt Damon . He is perhaps best-known for the Bourne spy series, which spawned three films from 2002. And, despite a shaky return once the series wrapped up, with the disappointing performances of The Adjustment Bureau, Margaret, Invictus, Green Zone, We Bought a Zoo and Promised Land, Damon showed once more he is a leading man when not playing Jason Bourne. End-of-the-world blockbuster Elysium became a big movie for Sony in 2013, not just for its global takings of $286 million, but for being an original screenplay - a follow-up to Neill Blomkamp's sleeper hit District 9 - and not an adaptation. However the big money will come in 2016, when he reprises his role as Bourne. Leading man: Matt Damon - pictured left with his wife Luciana Barroso - made a big comeback in 2013 with sci-fi hit Elysium (right) 4. Robert Downey Jr. This comeback king put a shocking bout of arrests, rehab and prison behind him when he played unconventional superhero Tony Stark in 2008's Iron Man. He followed it up in 2009 by appearing as the title role in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, and then its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows, in 2011. Iron Man 2 proved another major hit in 2010, and then the character appeared in The Avengers in 2012, before Iron Man 3 broke office records in 2013, collecting $1.2 billion. Downey Jr. now has an estimated net worth of $190 million, and is said to be on the best pay packet of all the actors who are signed on to The Avenger's. Comeback king: Robert Downey Jr. has played Iron Man in three installments, plus The Avengers franchise, all of which has a big pay pack . 5. Angelina Jolie . She won an Oscar for playing a disturbingly violent inmate of a female mental institution in 1999's Girl, Interrupted, before going to refashion herself as a leading action star, with roles in Gone In 60 Seconds, Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith, The Wanted and Salt. While her most recent film, Unbroken, featured her as director, the Disney live-action flick Maleficent became the fourth highest-grossing film of 2014, taking $758 million. The actress was paid a reported $15 million for the Sleeping Beauty remake, and is set to make $20 million for the Salt sequel. Regardless of the film, if Jolie is in it, audiences will go see it. Action star: While last year's Maleficent was a big box office hit, Jolie is expected to collect $20 for the Salt sequel . 6. Denzel Washington . Two-time Academy Award nominee Denzel Washington has a career that is as diverse as it is spread out. From Muslim minister and human rights activist Malcolm X in 1992, to boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter The Hurricane and football coach Herman Boone in Remember the Titans, he moved into a series of action roles, including Training Day, Man On Fire and American Gangster. But his portrayed of an alcoholic but brilliant commerical pilot who prevents a catastrophic plane crash in Flight is the most memorable of late. Washington is believed to have been paid $20 million - $10 million more than co-star Mark Wahlberg - for the 2013 film 2 Guns. According to The Hollywood Reporter survey, however, there is a separate list of actors who are not far behind this list. The second group are said to be able to command $15 million each per picture. In order, that list goes\u00a0Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence, Melissa McCarthy and Channing Tatum. The $15 million club: The recent survey said these six are Hollywood's next-in-line for huge pay packets.\u00a0In order, that list goes Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence, Melissa McCarthy and Channing Tatum .",

A team led by Imperial College London has already applied to patent the therapy, which they say could be ready for human trials within three years. The scientists discovered a protein which helps boost the body\u2019s immune system ten-fold, an astonishing effect which could help patients fight off cancers and viruses. The protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic T-cells, which have the ability to detect cancerous cells, hunt them down, and destroy them . The protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic T-cells, which have the ability to detect cancerous cells, hunt them down, and destroy them. In a chance discovery in mice, it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or LEM - dramatically boosted the body\u2019s number of T-cells. They are now developing a gene therapy that would boost the production of LEM proteins, in turn increasing the number of T-cells available to attack cancer cells. The therapy, revealed in the international journal Science last night, would use the existing T-cells taken from individual patients. The patient\u2019s cells would be removed, modified with the insertion of LEM-producing genes, and then infused back into the patients via a drip, probably on four occasions over two months. It might also be used to treat other viruses, they said. The development, which also involved researchers from Queen Mary University of London, ETH Zurich in Switzerland and Harvard Medical School in the US, has already been six years in the making. Cytotoxic T-cells are an important component of the immune system, but when faced with serious infections or advanced cancer, they are usually unable to mobilise in large enough quantities to fight the disease. In a chance discovery in mice, it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or LEM - dramatically boosted the body\u2019s number of T-cells . By screening mice with genetic mutations, the Imperial team discovered a strain of mice that produced ten times as many cytotoxic T-cells when infected with a virus, compared with normal mice. The discovery was unexpected because the new protein had no known function and resembles no other protein known to science. But the mice suppressed infections more effectively and were far more resistant to cancer. They also produced more of a second type of T-cells, memory cells, enabling them to recognise infections they have encountered previously and launch a rapid response. In further experiments the scientists went on to show that the LEM molecule had a similar impact on the human immune system. A team led by Imperial College London (pictured) has already applied to patent the therapy, which they say could be ready for human trials within three years . Study leader Professor Philip Ashton-Rickardt of Imperial College, said: \u2018Cancer cells have ways to suppress T-cell activity, helping them to escape the immune system. \u2018Genetically engineering T cells to augment their ability to fight cancer has been a goal for some time and techniques for modifying them already exist. \u2018By introducing an active version of the LEM gene into the T-cells of cancer patients, we hope we can provide a robust treatment for patients. \u2018Next we will test the therapy in mice, make sure it is safe and see if it can be combined with other therapies. The treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time, relying on an extraction of the patient\u2019s own cells . \u2018If all goes well, we hope to be ready to carry out human trials in about three years.\u2019 He said gene therapy would initially be used to treat patients with advanced cancer. The treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time, relying on an extraction of the patient\u2019s own cells. But he insisted the cost would be manageable, given the significant benefits it could bring. Imperial College has already filed two patents for the technology, and a spin-off company called ImmunarT has been formed with the aim of commercialising the therapy. Dr Mike Turner of the Wellcome Trust, which helped fund the research, said: \u2018The discovery of a protein that could boost the immune response to not only cancer, but also to viruses, is a fascinating one. \u2018Further investigation in animal models is needed before human trials can commence, but there is potential for a new type of treatment that capitalises on the immune system\u2019s innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells.\u2019",

The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club has quickly become one of Britain's most elite sporting venues since The Prince of Wales joined when it was founded in 1982. It's attracted royals and celebrities including Prince William and Harry, actress Stephanie Powers and Rolling Stone Bill Wyman. But attempts to cash in on this elite status by launching a brand of fashion and polo-related goods have been scuppered by the European Court after objections fromthe Beverly Hills Polo Club.

Bill Wyman, bass guitarist for The Rolling Stones at the club with a friend in 1987 . The ruling will be all the more frustrating for bosses at the Berkshire club, given that its rival isn't even a real polo club and openly admits to using the sport to create the perception of eliteness. The Berkshire club had applied to register its polo player logo on four classes of item including glasses, watches, jewellery and leather goods including travel bags, whips, harnesses and saddlery. But it was opposed by the Beverly Hills brand on the grounds that people could confuse the logo with their own and the case was eventually taken to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. While it allowed the logo on whips, harnesses and saddlery, which discerning customers were unlikely to get confused, it ruled against the Berkshire club on applications for the other items. It said: 'It is true that the polo player is facing left and holding his mallet upright, while the earlier marks the polo player is facing right and holding his mallet ready to strike the ball. 'However, those slight differences are not sufficient enough to reduce significantly the similarity deriving from the fact that both the signs at issue display the figure of a polo player astride a galloping horse,' The Times reports. In 2006, the club was also blocked from using its logo on perfume and soap after a challenge from Ralph Lauren, famous for its Polo brand, also featuring a polo player, swinging a mallet. Too similar: Logo for the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club . The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club was founded in 1985 by music mogul Bryan Morrison, who made a fortune working with stars including Wham, Pink Ffloyd, Elton John and Robin Gibb from The Beegees. After Prince Charles became its first member, it quickly gained an international reputation and attracted stars from the music, fashion and film industries. It also became a favourite with the royals, with the late Major Ronald Furguson, father of Sarah, Duchess of York, being employed as the sponsorship manager. Founder Morrison died in 2008, having spent two years in a coma after being thrown from his pony at the club. His son, Jamie, is an England polo player and is now involved in the commercial side of the club.

On the first day of filming in Scotland -- the first shot, in fact -- the camera broke. The weather was bad. The hotel was dismal. Python member Graham Chapman was suffering from alcohol withdrawal. It got better. On the day of its first American screening in New York, a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. Thanks to the popularity of \"Python\" on American TV, the movie was a box-office hit, making $5 million -- more than 10 times its budget. More importantly, it soon became a comedy classic. The dialogue alone has been widely quoted, with such lines as \"It's just a flesh wound\" and \"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries\" referenced on shows such as \"The Simpsons,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and \"The Blacklist.\"  Python member Eric Idle turned the film into the Tony-winning Broadway play \"Spamalot.\" The troupe ended up making three movies -- well, four, if you count \"And Now for Something Completely Different,\" five if you include \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,\" five-and-a-half if you allow \"The Rutles,\" six if you ... well, three. We'll say three. Is there a best one? Where should you start? Let's break them down: . From its dramatic opening credits featuring fake-Swedish subtitles to the adventures of Sir Launcelot (\"the boldest and most expensive of the knights\"), weighted-bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks, \"Holy Grail\" is probably the loosest and most Python-esque of the Python oeuvre. As a movie with a plot and character and all that movie nonsense, it falls short -- but as a repository for some of Python's best gags, it remains perhaps the best (and certainly most quotable) of the bunch. Besides, it features the word \"shrubbery.\" \" 'Grail' is a bit like 'A Hard Day's Night,' \" Idle observed in the Pythons' autobiography. \"It's got a joie de vivre that's very infectious, it's very hard not to like.\" Pros: The dialogue. The Black Knight. The Knights Who Say \"Ni.\" Cons: It's sometimes sloppy. And it doesn't really have an ending. Verdict: Better than a cheese shop full of ex-parrots. Probably Python's most consistent movie, \"Life of Brian\" is the story of a guy born down the road from Jesus who finds himself hailed as a messiah and ends up crucified. It was a satire on organized religion, first-century politics and zealotry -- one of the best bits is the ongoing argument between \"the People's Front of Judea\" and \"the Judean People's Front\" -- but try telling that to the protesters. The film was picketed in cities across the United States, deplored by some religious leaders and banned in Ireland and Norway. (Sweden promoted it with the line, \"The film so funny that it was banned in Norway.\") It did have one huge supporter: ex-Beatle George Harrison, who mortgaged his estate to help fund the movie when a financier pulled out. \"He paid for it because he wanted to see it,\" Idle recalled. \"The most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history.\" Pros: Graham Chapman's performance as Brian. \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Cons: The adventurous but ultimately pointless animated-alien scene. Michael Palin's lisping Pilate (though, to be fair, it's so childishly broad you can't help but laugh). Verdict: Funnier than the Spanish Inquisition. \"Meaning of Life,\" constructed as a series of sketches, is the most uneven of the three narrative Python films. After the stunning opening sequence, Gilliam's \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\" -- about the revenge of some pirate-like accountants -- the film struggles to find its footing. Even the Pythons thought so. \"The rhythms weren't right,\" said Gilliam. \"It needed a whole other rewrite,\" said Idle. Nevertheless, it has its moments: the \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" sequence, about religion, sex and contraception; the organ donor who's surprised by a demand for his liver; and -- of course -- the infamous Mr. Creosote, the absurdly fat man who gorges on a monstrous meal at a posh restaurant, regurgitates it at length, and is then encouraged to have a \"wafer-thin\" after-dinner mint -- with disastrous results. It also has the sweetest of all Python songs: Idle's \"The Galaxy Song,\" which is even more uplifting than \"Brian's\" \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\" Not a bad conclusion, given what happened to Mr. Creosote. Pros: \"Permanent Assurance.\" Mr. Creosote. \"The Galaxy Song.\" Cons: The fish. The schoolmaster's sex lesson. The fish. Verdict: More enjoyable than watching the Upper-Class Twit of the Year competition.",

The seal cull even takes place during the animals' breeding season - meaning that some cubs are being left to fend for themselves when their mothers are shot dead. Farmers say the seal killings are essential to stop the animals from destroying fish stocks off the coast of Scotland and northern England, but campaigners insist there are more humane methods of protecting fish. Warning: graphic images . Killed: This picture shows two seals shot in Crovie, north-east Scotland in an attempt to protect fish stocks . Shot: A seal killed near Blackpool; it is legal to cull seals without a licence in England . The practice of seal clubbing in Canada has long been regarded with revulsion around the world - but many Britons may be unaware that the animals are also being killed in the UK. Supporters of the practice claim that seals threaten farmed salmon, wild fish around the coasts and fish which are kept for sporting purposes. Figures from the Scottish government show that 205 seals were legally killed in Scottish waters last year by farmers, fishermen and angling firms. Some campaigners suggest that the real number of dead seals is much higher, as the official figure only includes those which were recorded to the authorities by people who had previously obtained licences. Fishermen have been given licences to kill more than 800 seals this year, although typically marksmen kill only around a quarter of the seals which can legally be culled. Trussed up: Two dead seals which have been thrown in the back of a van after being culled . Disposal: A van winches away the body of a seal after it was shot dead in Crovie to protect fish . Marksman: A gunman waits for the appearance of seals which could threaten stocks of salmon . Activists have called on consumers to more careful about buying Scottish salmon in supermarkets and fishmongers, encouraging them to investigate the origins of their fish. 'People who are horrified by what's happening in places like Norway and Scotland don't realise this is happening on their own doorstep,' said Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. 'The shooting tends to go on in remote locations, so it's not something most people tend to come across. Unlike in some countries, seals are not hunted in the UK for their skin, fur or meat. However, fishermen and farmer are allowed to kill seals which they believe are threatening fish stocks. In Scotland, they must get a licence which restricts the number of animals they can legally kill. But in the rest of Britain, there are no legal restrictions on culling seals, meaning people are free to do as they please. 'It's very simple - ask your retailer before you buy Scottish salmon whether seals were shot in the production of that salmon. 'Not every fish farmer is shooting seals, it's perfectly possible to protect fish without shooting seals.' He insisted that there is no need to cull seals in order to keep them away from fish stocks, saying that acoustic deterrents and strong nets can protect salmon just as well. Around three quarters of farms where seals are killed are certified by the RSPCA as 'Freedom Food' farms, Mr Ottaway added, saying that the animal protection charity should do more to crack down on the practice. He also called on the Scottish government to toughen up its licensing regime, which states that seals should only be killed as a 'last resort'. Mr Ottaway said: 'It's not the last resort if they're not using the best possible deterrents and the best possible nets. 'They recognise the value of seals as a tourist attraction, but have no problem with shooting them.' Threatened: British seal pups could starve if their mothers are shot dead (file photo) Protection: You need a licence to kill seals in Scotland but not in other parts of the UK (file photo) Because there are no restrictions on when farmers can kill seals if they have a licence, breeding mothers are likely to die, leaving their cubs unable to fend for themselves. Outside Scotland, it is legal to kill seals without any need for a licence - meaning that there is no way of measuring exactly how many die every year. The Scottish salmon industry, which produces annual export of \u00a3285million, insists that it is necessary to kill seals in order to protect farms. Scott Landsburgh of the Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation told the Daily Mirror: 'We have championed deterrence techniques that are designed to keep seals away from our fish, and shooting is always last resort. 'When a determined seal attacks fish in our pens it can kill and damage large numbers and it is important that we do whatever we can to reduce the chances of this happening.' A spokesman for the Scottish government said: 'Scottish seals are now better protected than ever before. Since 2011 it has been illegal in Scotland to shoot a seal except as a last resort under strict licensing conditions, and the number of seals shot under licence has more than halved since then.'",

It is perhaps fitting that Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots. Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance\u00e9 at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Juntion prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Old neighborhood: Cedar Junction is about a mile and a half away from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play tight end for the New England Patriots . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home. New home: Hernandez is starting his sentence at maximum-security prison MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (pictured above) Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts (pictured above . They then post for a new mugshot and are fingerprinted before sitting in a special chair that scans their bodies for possible hidden objects. All new inmates receive a paper bag containing seven pairs of underwear and a specially-designed razor and pen that can't be used as a weapon. Jerry-rigged weapons are something Hernandez should be concerned with, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hogson. Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said. Labor: Workers at Cedar Junction's prison manufacture license plates for 50 cents an hour - a far cry from the $40million contract extension Hernandez received from the Patriots in 2012 . The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma. And for a former professional athlete who's used to eating large satisfying meals, Hernandez may lose his appetite in the cafeteria where the food was once described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Cedar Point is where all male inmates are booked when they start their sentences in Massachusetts, so Hernandez will eventually be moved to another facility in the coming weeks or months, . It's reported that he will be sent to Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts next. Moving: Hernandez will be moved in the coming weeks or moths to the Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts (pictured above)",

Both Democrats are toying with a presidential run, both are facing long odds in that endeavor, and both shared a stage at the Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Friday night. But, as was evident at the dinner, that is where the similarities end. O'Malley is a former mayor and Maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand. Webb, on the contrary, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former senator from Virginia who comes across as more stoic and, at times, uncomfortable with retail politics. Before the event, O'Malley confidently cruised the union hall. He took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances. \"It is a marathon, not a sprint,\" one man told O'Malley, a nod to his long odds in the 2016 Democratic nomination process. \"Yes, it is; it's a marathon,\" O'Malley responded. \"Welcome to Iowa,\" said another man. \"We hope to see you here more.\" O'Malley smiled, \"Thanks a lot. I hope you do, too.\" Webb wasn't nearly as active, opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him. As Webb cut into his sizable helping of pork, O'Malley was standing directly behind him, shaking hands. The former Virginia senator, after possibly seeing O'Malley making the rounds, did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard Democratic activists in the room. \"Seven months old,\" Zach Smith, a new father, said of his baby boy, Noah. \"I have a bunch of kids. The youngest one is 8 years old,\" Webb said. The baby looked up at the senator. \"He is pretty calm,\" Webb remarked, himself calm. Despite coming from bordering states, Webb and O'Malley don't know each other. When they passed each other in a Des Moines hotel lobby on Friday morning, it was the first time the two had met. That said, the two Democrats find themselves in the same position. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid Sunday, leads every national and state poll of the Democratic field. She has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination. O'Malley and Webb are both looking up at her. In a March CNN/ORC poll (PDF) of national Democrats, only 1% said O'Malley and Webb were their top choice. In a January poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register (PDF), O'Malley was at 1% among Iowa Democrats, while Webb found himself at 3%. The speaking portion of the night further showed Webb and O'Malley's differences. Webb, who spoke before the governor, gave a more subdued, biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president: Basic governance, economic justice and criminal justice reform. To the approval of the audience, Webb promised to come back to Iowa regularly. \"I am committing to you right now,\" he said, \"we are going to go over the whole state.\" And the biggest applause came near the end of his speech, when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues. \"Money is ruining our political process,\" Webb said to a chorus of applause and \"hear hear.\" O'Malley, on the other hand, gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines. At points, the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands. \"When the American Dream is denied, our lives shrink, our hopes fade, and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear,\" O'Malley said, delivering the same stump speech he usually gives. \"To make the dream true again, we must fight for better wages for all workers, so that Americans can support their families on what they earn.\" As the event wound down, Webb and O'Malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people. O'Malley, who spent the previous day in Iowa, left Friday night for New York. Webb, who is in the midst of a four-day trip to Iowa, stayed in Des Moines and headlined a veterans event on Saturday morning in Waterloo. Webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event. He told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans. He also touted his work on passing the 21st Century G.I. Bill of Rights, a 2008 act that expanded education benefits for veterans, and stressed that more needed to be done. \"You want the next greatest generation, give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had,\" Webb said to applause. \"If you really want to thank them, hire a vet.\" After the event, Webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny Saturday morning. Asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, Webb smiled. Skepticism of retail politics is not new for Webb. As a one-term Democratic senator, Webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning, namely fundraising and retail politics. This time, he put on a rosy view. \"This is the good part of it, \"Webb said, with a laugh. \"Talking to the media, that is not always the good part.\"",

Horrified guests dived for cover as the groom's brother lost control of the gun at a reception in the capital Riyadh. Firing guns in the air is a traditional way of celebrating special occasions in some parts of Saudi Arabia and despite government efforts to stop it, the dangerous practice lingers on. Shotgun wedding: The groom's brother was caught on camera as he lost control of a Kalashnikov while firing a celebratory round into the air . Banging start: As the man starts shooting, he loses control of the rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street over the wedding guest . The incident was caught on camera, and the short clip shows the wedding party making its way towards the wedding hall when suddenly the brother of the groom starts shooting in the air. As he fires off the celebratory round, he loses control of the Kalashnikov rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street. Once he stops shooting, the video shows the guests attempt to reform a queue and act as if nothing untoward had happened, while  resuming their slow procession to the wedding. The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times. Several online commentators criticise the gunman, calling him irresponsible and unable to hold his rifle right. Bad move:\u00a0The procession was making its way towards the ceremony when the man started shooting . Bad aim: The round accidentally hits the wall as the wedding procession walks and bullets ricochet . The 30-second clip, believed to have been filmed with a mobile phone has been viewed nearly 140,000 times . User KhalifASakar wrote: 'It was highly irresponsible on his part. If he was so keen on his kind of jubilation, he should do it in an open space away from people. 'Even though I do not know much about firearms, I can tell you he was not holding his Kalashnikov correctly.' Another, Byzanti, said: 'The police should use the video clip to identify the brother and apply the law. 'As long as there is no punishment, people will continue to act irresponsibly. Those who attempt to show off their firearm skills are usually cowards in real action.' Abu Atab posted: 'The Kalashnikov man should be tied up alongside the family sheep until the wedding is over.' The Saudi government has been calling for an end to the local tradition of firing guns into the air to celebrate weddings and birthdays, which has often resulted in accidental deaths. A government spokesman said: 'Security agencies have been told to monitor wedding halls and places of celebration to prevent this sort of thing happening. 'Those that break the law will be severely punished. We are aware of this video and relevant authorities are looking into it.'",

Consultant Peter Wilson told a BBC TV documentary Ashya\u2019s chances of long-term survival could have been halved by Brett and Naghmeh King\u2019s decision to flee abroad with him before he had the treatment he was being offered here. Dr Wilson, clinical director for child health at Southampton General Hospital, claimed the chemotherapy was essential to reduce the chances of the five-year-old\u2019s cancer returning. Scroll down for video . Clinicians in an \u2018impossible situation\u2019 as a result of King family\u2019s flight to Spain after disagreeing with doctors . And in an interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he complained of the \u2018vitriol\u2019 to which he had been subjected as a result of the case, saying: \u2018I personally received a letter from a person who said they wished my children got cancer and died.\u2019 Mr and Mrs King had accused the hospital of planning treatment which would have left their son a \u2018vegetable\u2019 and took him abroad last year for proton beam therapy, an alternative form of radiotherapy. Mr King, 51, said Ashya did not need subsequent chemotherapy as his cancer was in remission. Last month, four months after the proton treatment ended, the family said scans showed \u2018no evidence\u2019 of the tumour. But Dr Wilson, a paediatric intensive care consultant, said Ashya should have undergone chemotherapy within six weeks of his original surgery to remove the tumour in Southampton last July, and said it was too early to say he had been cured. He told the BBC: \u2018We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is\u2026 every month that goes by that he\u2019s not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens. The family then went to Prague for proton beam therapy, and now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour . \u2018There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival \u2013 so survival going from 80 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent, which is quite dramatic.\u2019 Dr Wilson said there was an \u2018international consensus\u2019 of medical opinion that Ashya\u2019s form of brain cancer should be treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After he had the surgery in Southampton his parents took him from the hospital without telling doctors. He was eventually given radiotherapy in the form of proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic, but his parents said the chemotherapy was not needed. They initially fled to Spain where they were arrested then released after the High Court approved their plan to take Ashya to Prague. The NHS eventually agreed to pay for the proton therapy there. Dr Wilson said there was a risk that tiny cancerous cells remained around the tumour site after the surgery, and that chemotherapy and radiotherapy were required to treat those cells to offer the best possible chance that the cancer would not return. The Kings were unavailable for comment but have said they wanted Ashya to receive the best possible treatment. Paediatric intensive care consultant Dr Peter Wilson said it was 'deeply unfair when the NHS is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all\u2019 that he had to say no to parents wanting proton beam therapy for their children .",

The U.N.-sponsored talks should resume \"but only after a complete halt of attacks,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in a Facebook post. The previous round of talks between Houthi rebels and the government of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi failed in January after rebels attacked the President's personal residence and presidential palace in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly monthlong air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni government military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, according to security sources in Taiz. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. Explosions lasted for about 40 minutes, they said. It was unclear whether it was a resumption of the operation or a short-term series of strikes. Meanwhile, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa on Wednesday, according to a senior Saudi source speaking on condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back \"security and stability through establishing a political process,\" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Hadi, who claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,\" said Hadi. In the country's south, security officials on Wednesday reported two U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants in Mukalla. Six suspected militants died in the attack. This is the second drone strike in three days. On Monday, six militants were killed when drone strikes targeted two vehicles in Shabwah, west of Mukalla. A U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday that the United States is conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last few days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Nic Robertson, Salim Essaid, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.",

Investigated: Between 2009 and 2014 a total of 617 youngsters aged under ten in the West Midlands either committed, of were suspected of committing, a crime, according to figures (file picture posed by model) They include 41 nine-year-old boys investigated for crimes last year including five suspected of sexual offences, according to the details released\u00a0after a Freedom of Information Act request. A nine-year-old girl was also linked to a case of criminal damage while a five-year-old girl was alleged to have committed sexual activity with a child. The legal age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten. But four-year-old children have also been investigated on suspicion of possessing cannabis, criminal damage, assault, theft and sexual activity with a child aged under 13. In both 2013 and 2014 two-year-old boys were believed to be behind assaults and in 2012 a three-year-old girl was suspected of being responsible for a theft. Publication: West Midlands Police (whose headquarters in Birmingham are pictured) released figures showing that in both 2013 and 2014 two-year-old boys were believed to be behind assaults . Police admitted some of the figures may be inaccurate - including statistics showing a rape suspect aged minus three, and a one-year-old breaching a non-molestation order. A boy of 13 became one of Britain's youngest murderers after he was jailed for at least 12 years for killing a woman he had just mugged by stamping on her face so hard it left a footprint on her cheek.

He added that the FOI response was released with the following caveat: 'Although every effort is made to ensure the figures presented are accurate and complete, the data collected is subject to inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recorded system. \u2018As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when interpreting those data. \u2018Data on ages is calculated from date of birth, which is inputted manually.

He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.",

In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It's very, very dangerous. It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.",

A groundbreaking facial surgeon has been struck off after repeatedly punching a patient in the face 'like a boxer' to fix his broken cheekbone. Professor Ninian Peckitt, 63, claimed he was attempting to reduce the fracture when he hit the patient up to ten times while a colleague held his head, a medical hearing heard. The patient, known as Patient A, had come to Ipswich Hospital in February 2012 after an industrial accident and been operated on by Prof Peckitt, who is a world-renowned facial surgeon. But he required a second procedure after falling off the bed in hospital which displaced his cheekbone. That's when Prof Peckitt struck the patient while he was under anesthetic. Prof Peckitt, an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo-facial surgery at Ipswich Hospital, claimed he 'digitally manipulated' the patient's face and denied any wrongdoing. But he was 'erased' from the medical register after the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel found that his fitness to practice was impaired. The hearing heard that\u00a0Patient A could have been blinded by the force of the punches from Professor Peckitt. Chair Dr Ian Spafford said 'under no circumstances' would it be appropriate to apply enough force to potentially damage to the optic nerve. Erica Rapaport, a dental surgeon with more than 30 years experience, said she was told to hold the patient's head before the first punch. She said she was left in 'total shock' and there were gasps from colleagues in the operating theatre as she gave a harrowing account of the procedure. 'He made his hand into a fist and he hit the patient in the face on the left side of his cheek. 'His hand was about six inches away. I think the first time he punched the patient I wasn't holding him and it was then that I was instructed to do so by Prof Peckitt. 'He said that when the patient fell out of bed, the cheekbone which was already fractured was moved outwards so he was trying to re-position it without having to make further cuts to the face. 'He said this at least after the first punch. 'He applied about ten punches like a boxer. He took aim and then punched. 'The first punch was unexpected and then he explained what he was doing. He spoke as he punched again and again.' After graduating in medicine from the University of Sheffield in 1979, Mr Peckitt completed further training with the Royal College of Surgeons of England and became a Fellow of the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery in 2009. He has lectured on titanium implants and been published in medical journals so Miss Rapaport said she came into the hospital on her day off to take part in surgery and learn about his renowned techniques. Christopher Hamlet, representing the General Medical Council, previously told the hearing that the case wasn't based on the outcome of the procedure but the method. Professor Peckitt didn't seek advice from colleagues and quit his post days later. He was also alleged to have failed to check the medical records of a second patient, Patient B, which led to him attempting an unnecessary procedure on her, and to have treated another, Patient C, for a complex facial deformity without seeking the advice of another surgeon. At the tribunal in Manchester, Miss Rapaport was asked to clarify the analogy by panel member Dr Shazad Amin who suggested it implied Prof Pickett took a 'larger swing'. Asked if the punch was more 'of a jab', she added: 'I meant he was looking to take aim. Professor Ninian Peckitt had been an Honorary locum consultant at Ipswich Hospital when he punched a patient to correct a broken cheekbone. He later wrote the patient's face had been 'digitally manipulated' 'When I said it was like a boxer I meant he was carefully aiming where he wanted to hit. 'Then he pulled his hand back to get the maximum hit as he touched the patient's face. 'I can remember a feeling of total shock the first time he hit the patient because I wasn't expecting it and I think anyone who saw what happened was reacting in a similar way and then he asked me to assist by holding the patient's head. '[The punches] were his fist aimed at the side of the patient's face. 'He was looking himself and inspecting it and asked if anybody thought the fracture had moved. 'I understand generally it is nice not to have to make an incision but I do not understand the uncontrolled nature of hitting someone. 'I didn't challenge him at the time. I was too shocked.' Miss Rapaport added that following the operation, Prof Peckitt told her to write that the cheek had been adjusted by 'external pressure' in her operating notes. She said: 'Prof Peckitt asked me to write up the note and I felt very challenged by what he had just done. I asked him if he would write it and he said he would dictate the exact words for me to write down. 'He said \"the left malar was adjusted by external pressure\". They were precisely his words. 'I particularly [didn't want to] write the note because accurately I would have had to write \"Prof Peckitt punched the patient to try and move the left zygoma\" and that's not something I would have wanted to do. 'I didn't challenge him. Partly because he is a consultant and partly because I was so shocked that I didn't have the strength to argue. 'I didn't see any damage, I just thought it was a very unusual technique. 'I was holding his head very still. It must have moved a little [when he punched] but not much. 'Prof Peckitt is much stronger than I am so I could only give as much support as I could so it might have moved a little. 'If I asked you to hold something still then I punched it, you don't know how hard someone is going to punch so you don't know how much resistance to apply.' Prof Peckitt has pioneered 'engineering-assisted' surgery techniques and written extensively on the subject, as well as cosmetic surgery. He is now believed to be working as a consultant surgeon in Dubai and elected not to attend the hearing but issued an email in which he 'emphatically denied' the allegations. He claimed he was being 'victimised' but the panel ignored these claims and the professor was struck off. Panel chair Ian Spafford said: 'The Panel has determined that Mr Peckitt's misconduct is fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to practise medicine. 'Therefore, it has determined that, in the particular circumstances of this case, it would not be sufficient nor proportionate to suspend his registration. 'The Panel is of the view that the public interest requires that it be made clear that Mr Peckitt's behaviour is unacceptable in a member of the medical profession. 'The Panel has determined to direct that Mr Peckitt's name be erased from the Medical Register. 'In the light of all the evidence presented to it, it is satisfied that erasure is a proportionate sanction in his case.'",

A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub\u2019s Facebook page on April 3  - a week after Luke Lazarus was sentenced for raping an 18-year-old at the club. The 23-year-old privileged son of Andrew Lazarus, the owner of the venue in Sydney\u2019s Kings Cross, was jailed for at least three years for the crime on March 27. The photo\u2019s caption said: \u2018We\u2019re throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight \u2013 get amongst it!\u2019 Scroll down for video . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub\u00a0on May 12, 2013 . A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub\u2019s Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter, the Daily Life reports, with one shocked social media user complaining: \u2018This is how Luke Lazarus (sic) father promotes nightclub SOHO. Posted week after sentencing!\u2019. A Twitter user told Daily Mail Australia : \u2018Once it did Twitter rounds and people started commenting it was removed by Saturday.\u2019 A SOHO management spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: \u2018The event on the night was set up by an external promoter as a one-off event. 'He was given access to the official Facebook page but as soon as we noticed he\u2019d put that up it was taken down.' The club agreed that the photo used was \u2018100 per cent inappropriate\u2019. During Luke Lazarus\u2019s rape trial, the jury was told that the former private schoolboy boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway. During Luke Lazarus\u2019s rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' The woman attempted to go back inside in the early hours of May 12, 2013, but Lazarus forcefully told her to get down on the ground on all fours. In sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. On the night the teen was assaulted, the court heard it was the first time she had gone to Sydney's Kings Cross. The SOHO nightclub is a popular venue in Sydney's Kings Cross district . After entering the club Soho, Lazarus walked up to her, told her he was a part owner in the venue and showed her a business card. He then asked if she would like to enter a VIP area before taking her into an alleyway out back. They kissed but when she said she wanted to go back to her friends he said: 'No, stay'. He pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. Scared, she complied. During the ten minute assault that followed, the teen told him she was a virgin. The disturbing image was soon removed by the club's management after a backlash on Twitter . The photo which caused offence on April 3 is in-line with similar photos posted the club's Facebook page . When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. He later texted a friend 'sick night, took a chick's virginity LOL so tight'. Judge Huggett said: 'It was her right to kiss the accused and it was her right to say she wanted to return to her friend. The offender ignored that.' The girl informed police the next morning who seized CCTV footage from the venue which confirmed Lazarus led the woman into the alleyway. Judge Huggett said Lazarus came from a privileged upbringing and had an inflated sense of entitlement and power when he was at the Soho. But she found he had good prospects of rehabilitation, was unlikely to reoffend and was suffering from an adjustment disorder due to a break-up in the weeks prior to the offence. She sentenced him to a maximum of five years in jail. He will be eligible for release in March 2018. Judge Huggett said Lazarus, a South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, came from a privileged upbringing . Lazarus told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement.' He also added that it made him physically ill to think that the incident was not consensual. The 23-year-old was allegedly seeing an American woman but ended the relationship due to his parent's disapproval of her not being Greek. Psychiatrist Dr. Christopher Rikard-Bell, said Lazarus was suffering emotional symptoms as a result of the break up. After Lazarus's sentencing a series of prominent public figures in the local community spoke out in his defence with character references. Waverley mayor Sally Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed his supporters, saying: 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice.'",

Pictures from state-controlled media show the dictator smiling and waving, with his right wrist in bandages . It is the latest in a string of presumed health problems for the North Korean dictator, aged 32 . According to a South Korean official, quoted in Sky News, Jong-Un must have suffered the injury in the recent past. 'He didn't have the injury when he inspected a military unit on April 4,' the government spokesman said, 'so it must be recent.' Doctors who have examined the photos say it is unlikely that he has fractured his wrist, and judged it to be a minor injury. The state of Kim Jong-Un's health is the subject of fascination around the globe, as he presides over the world's most secretive state. Kim Jong-un resurfaced after six weeks of no appearances in October, walking with the help of a walking stick. There were rumours that he had had a gastric band fitted, or suffering from gout which put pressure on his feet . Pictured here with army generals in 2012, King Jong-Un is named the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He has previously revealed plans to launch nuclear strikes on US cities .

Amanda Casey, also of North Carolina, was married to Michael Wilkie for four years and had a daughter with him before the couple divorced. He went on to marry his third wife, Shelby Wilkie. Michael Wilkie was found guilty of first-degree murder in January for the 2012 killing of Shelby Wilkie and is serving a life sentence without parole. Amanda Casey has opened up about the abuse she faced at the hands of Michael Wilkie, who in January was found guilty of the 2012 murder of his third wife . 'He said if I ever tried to take his daughter away from him that he would kill me,' Casey told ABC's 20/20. Casey and Shelby Wilkie had met Michael Wilkie through an online dating site. Casey said they dated for a year-and-a-half before getting married. 'He was very friendly, very charming, easy to talk to, very soft spoken, and he had a good job and seemed to be pretty good,' Casey said. A couple months after marrying in 2004, Michael Wilkie began controlling aspects of Casey's life and alienating himself from Casey's daughter from a previous marriage, Casey said. 'If I planned to do something with one of my friends, he would manipulate the situation, and there would be something that came up that would interfere or get in the way,' she said. And then he began to get physically abusive and attacked her when she was pregnant with their daughter. He grabbed me around my throat and threw me around our bedroom and on the bed. My shoulder went through and made that hole in the sheetrock in the bedroom,' she said. Michael Wilkie (left) was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for killing his third wife, Shelby Wilkie (right). Shelby and Michael Wilkie, both of North Carolina, had met on an online dating site . But Casey never reported the incident and her friends and family were not aware of Michael Wilkie's abusive side because 'he was so good at masking'. 'It was like Jekyll and Hyde: two personalities and you didn't know which one you would get,' Casey said. 'You didn't know which one. You would meet when you got home.' She said she 'had thoughts' that Michael Wilkie would kill her, 'mainly because he told me he would kill me'. But Casey didn't leave Wilkie for quite some time. 'I am the type of person that I will stay in a situation, whether it's a job or a marriage \u2026 longer than I should because I don't give up hope easily,' she told 20/20. 'And I am always thinking about, 'What could I do to make it better?' After an argument about pictures taken of their daughters together in 2006, Casey left Michael Wilkie. She took her older daughter but left the couple's three-year-old behind. The couple later divorced in 2008. Casey eventually remarried and gained joint-custody of her and Michael Wilkie's child, and met her former husband's new wife, Shelby Wilkie, at a school event for their daughter. Shelby Wilkie was murdered in 2012 and her remains were found after a long search. Her and Michael Wilkie's child, Sydney (left), is in the process of being adopted by Shelby's brother, Bill Sprowls, Jr, against Michael\u2019s wishes . She did not, however, warn Shelby Wilkie about the abuse she faced when she was married to Michael Wilkie. 'I had hoped that things had changed, and that it was me and not, you know, him. And that way, hey, he could be happy. She could be happy, and it could be a nice household environment,' Casey said about the couple. Just before Shelby Wilkie went missing the pair did have a short conversation. 'She said, 'I just want to ask you some things about Michael, is that OK?' And I said, 'Sure,' Casey recalled. 'And I said, 'Shelby, if there is anybody that knows what you are going through, it's me.' Casey told Shelby Wilkie she had to go shortly after and asked her to call her back. She never got a call back, and instead saw Michael Wilkie pleading for Shelby Wilkie to come home. Casey (right) married Michael Wilkie in 2004. She said a few months after the wedding be become controlling and eventually physically abusive. At times, she said she feared he would kill her . At first, Casey thought that Shelby Wilkie had run from her husband, but Michael Wilkie was then arrested, charged and found guilty of his wife's murder. Shelby Wilkie had filed two domestic violence charges against her husband before her death, but both were voluntarily dismissed, according to WSOC. Blood and her ashes, along with a charred bracelet her mother had given her, were later found and Michael Wilkie was arrested, according to ABC. And it wasn't until his arrest that Casey finally felt safe, she said. 'It's made me grow as a person,' she said. 'And it has made me stronger as a human being.'",

A National Counterterrorism Center advisory group, ordered by the White House, is expected to recommend what would mark a radical shift in US hostage policy, ABC news reported on Sunday. The NCTC interviewed families of hostages, including the parents of journalist James Foley, who was killed by Islamic State fighters. The family of a US contractor held by Al-Qaeda militants, Warren Weinstein (above), confirmed they paid a ransom in an attempt to secure his release which was reported in the amount of $250,000 . Foley's mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son, and warned that her family could face prosecution for doing so. The Obama administration has denied making any such threats. 'There will be absolutely zero chance of any family member of an American held hostage overseas ever facing jail themselves, or even the threat of prosecution, for trying to free their loved ones,' a senior official told ABC News. Meanwhile, the family of US contractor Warren Weinstein, who was snatched by Al-Qaeda in Pakistan in 2011, confirmed it had paid a ransom to try to secure his release, which was in the amount of $250,000, according to\u00a0CBS News. A spokesman for the family said it had 'made every effort to engage with those holding him or those with the power to find and rescue him.' 'This is an ordinary American family and they are not familiar with how one manages a kidnapping,' the spokesman added. Hostage James Foley was killed by Islamic State fighters. His mother Diane said that officials from President Barack Obama's administration repeatedly told her family it was illegal to try to raise a ransom to free her son . 'As such, they took the advice of those in government who deal with such issues on a regular basis and were disappointed that their efforts were not ultimately successful.' It was unclear what sort of advice the family received from US government officials. Diane Foley welcomed the potential policy shift, which officials discussed with her last week. 'There's a lot that needs to be fixed,' she told ABC News. She said the past threats were 'the straw that broke the camel's back. It was incredible.' A number of hostage families expressed outrage after US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was freed by the Haqqani Network in Pakistan a year ago in exchange for the release of five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo Bay military prison.

The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea's previous two matches, however. Thibaut Courtois (centre) was in phenomenal form as Chelsea beat rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . Courtois (centre) has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a  goal for Hull on March 22 . Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull (left) but was back on form against QPR on Sundat . His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend. But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result. 'I never doubted that I can't catch the ball. Against Hull, I just tried to make the best solution,' he said. 'It was not the best control, but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team. 'Against Stoke, if you want to play high as a team, you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well. Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen. 'But I showed against QPR that if you play high, you can go get the ball from the midfield. If I'm on the 16 yard box, I can go get it there. For me it's not a problem. Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam's 66-yard strike against Stoke . Courtois (right) said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea . 'I continue. I never doubt myself. That's my strength. I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I'm happy. 'The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won. 'I'm 22 and still learning.

Officials didn't say what Schultz was being treated for and the motive for the stabbing remains under investigation. The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home (right) on Saturday on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz . Deputies were told on the police radio that the victim had been stabbed in the neck, reports the San Francisco Gate. The day before the stabbing, deputies had also been called to the home on a request for a psychological evaluation of Schultz. Neighbors say five children lived there and it is believed Schultz may have been friends with one of the older siblings, reports ABC7. Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental . The\u00a0Contra Costa Times reports the stabbing occurred mere yards from the school the younger boy attended. Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Ken Westermann said that the attack wasn't accidental. 'This wasn't a random act. This wasn't some sort of stranger that came into the home and murdered a child. This was a family friend,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'This little guy was the most energetic on the team,' said Almgren's Little League coach Mike De Lambert told KCRA. 'Great smile. And he was infectious, in a positive way, to everybody that he came in contact with.' Discovery Bay is a waterfront community along the banks of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.",

With Lewis Hamilton yet to sign his new contract as he negotiates the finer details with Mercedes, it has been suggested that the 30-year-old will replace Raikkonen at Ferrari for next season. The Finn, however, has arguably never been happier during his Formula One career courtesy of the atmosphere generated within the team by the arrival of the charismatic Arrivabene. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his victory at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen . Raikkonen shakes hands with Hamilton in parc ferme after finishing behind the race winner in Bahrain . Last week Arrivabene urged Raikkonen to raise his game in the wake of an indifferent start to the campaign, certainly compared with team-mate Sebastian Vettel. In Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix, Raikkonen did exactly that, finishing on the podium for the first time in 26 grands prix as runner-up to Hamilton. The performance naturally resulted in Arrivabene being asked as to Raikkonen's chances of staying, given he has an option on his deal for next year, but also whether Ferrari were interested in Hamilton. Arrivabene said: 'Does Lewis Hamilton call you? Because he never calls me. Every driver here in the paddock wants to drive for Ferrari, this is normal, even guys that were quite a lot of the time world champion. 'I'm happy with the drivers we have, but this does not mean I am going to sign with Kimi tomorrow. Nico Rosberg duels for position with Sebastian Vettel heading into Turn 1 during Sunday's race in Bahrain . Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, celebrates his first podium finish since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix . 'We are very clear, I repeat again: I said to Kimi, 'Look, it depends on your performance' and he has demonstrated he's a great driver. 'So if you ask me now \"Does he deserve to renew the option?\" I am going to say yes. But if I am going to say yes, I don't want the driver to fall asleep. I want to keep him awake. Kimi is at his best when he is in a bit in trouble. This is a psychological approach. So the paper (the contract) at the moment is white. Sometimes I have to take the pen, then take it back.' Raikkonen produced his best performance of the season to finish second behind Hamilton . Although Raikkonen managed to split Mercedes duo Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, with Vettel down in fifth, it was not the result practice had suggested as Ferrari appeared stronger on long-run pace than Mercedes. Arrivabene knows Ferrari still have plenty of work to do if they are to keep pace with Mercedes on a regular basis. 'We put together an aggressive strategy, which is exactly what we discussed,' added Arrivabene. 'We recognise the gap we have to Mercedes, so the only way is to be aggressive, even though at this stage you can make a mistake if you are aggressive. 'If one day we are able to catch them, of course the strategy must be put together in a way that is a bit different.'",

McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results allied to the revelation that he receives a cut of transfer fees for United players sales. Since selling prize assets Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic for \u00a32million on transfer deadline day, United have won just once, in a Scottish Cup tie at Stranraer. Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong has backed under-fire Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara . McNamara has faced a furious fan backlash in the past week amid a woeful run of results . After 10 games without a win, the heat was turned up on McNamara on Wednesday night when United lost 3-1 at Dens Park \u2013 their first derby defeat to Dundee since November 2004. However, as McNamara comes under increasing pressure from United fans, some of whom believe his position is untenable, Armstrong yesterday backed his old boss to ride out the most testing period of his managerial career. \u2018Jackie McNamara is a good guy. He was always really nice to me when I was at United - and he is capable of turning it around,\u2019 said the 23-year-old. Celtic unveil former Dundee Utd teammates Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven following their exit . \u2018Yes, United are having woes just now. They are on a bad run of form, and the injuries aren\u2019t really helping either. But these things happen in football. I am sure Jackie McNamara and United will turn it around \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u2019 Asked yesterday if this spell was the toughest test so far of his managerial career, McNamara said: \u2018Not really. We went through a spell last year but it\u2019s things I\u2019ll learn from. I am learning so it\u2019s been good in that sense. \u2018I\u2019ve learned different things, reasons for things and different scenarios recently. I think that will stand me in good stead.\u2019 Mackay-Steven (right) celebrates his goal with former Dundee United teammate John Rankin . Ex-United defender Mark Wilson, who also left Tannadice in January, insists the root of the current crisis at United has been their losing streak - not the manager\u2019s controversial bonus scheme. United face Hamilton today, who have not won in 12 matches, and Wilson believes \u2018bruised figure\u2019 McNamara can win back the fans if he can restore his team to winning ways. \u2018The bonus row doesn\u2019t sit well with the fans,\u2019 conceded Wilson. \u2018But that\u2019s purely because the team is losing. If the team was winning it would all be brushed under the carpet. \u2018Does the manager look a bruised figure right now? Yes, but you can see why! He\u2019 s built a successful attacking team and his players are getting ripped away. Former Dundee United ace Armstrong celebrates with Mackay-Steven after scoring for Celtic . 'You don\u2019t know whether the players had clauses, or whether it\u2019s been a decision made at the top of the club, but if you took Armstrong and Mackay Steven out of any team it would leave a massive hole. 'Take away Andrew Robertson and Ryan Gauld, who were sold last summer, that\u2019s four mainstays of last year\u2019s team now gone. \u2018Those are big shoes to fill, and I\u2019m sure the likes of Aidan Connolly and Blair Spitall, if given time, will do that. Jackie has shown he can go out and buy and rear genuine stars. I believe there is still enough quality there for United to grind out results and start climbing up the league.\u2019",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)The United States has gained much from its position as a space-faring nation. Indeed, U.S. access to space has provided incredible benefit to U.S. national security, defense and the economic well-being of the nation. And in order to effectively confront current and future conflicts, combat terrorism and counter the proliferating threats worldwide, our military depends on space-based capabilities, including intelligence, GPS, and communications satellites. Unfortunately, as global threats increase and the need for assured space access accelerates, the U.S. is faced with a troubling reality -- we are far too reliant on Russian technology to meet our national security obligations. How? For a start, we depend on the Atlas V rocket, which carries many of our most important satellites and is powered by the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine. The fact that we rely on Russia, currently under sanctions for invading a sovereign nation, should reinforce the need for a change in our current course. Assured access to space is an area where the U.S. should not be reliant on nonsecure foreign supply chains, which are subject to disruption, threats, unfavorable contracts and undue leverage against the interests of the U.S. The Ukraine crisis should have served as a wake-up call, highlighting the danger of dependence on Russia to launch national security satellites into space. And the United States should play no part in supporting the defense industry of a country that continues to abrogate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors. Simply put, it is bad policy to rely on others for critical national security requirements, and worse policy when this reliance supports countries taking action in direct contradiction to U.S. national security interests. Dmitry Rogozin, a Russian Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defense and space industries, has called American taxpayer outlays for the Russian engine \"free money\" that goes directly back into Russia's missile modernization programs. It is high time the U.S. government turn to its existing domestic capability and turn off this flow of funds. Fortunately, there are some signs of progress. Last year, Congress took bipartisan action to phase out reliance on the RD-180 engine by the end of the decade, and to transition to an all-American space launch capability. The defense authorization for fiscal year 2015 included restrictions on the future use of the RD-180 for the Atlas V, authorizing $220 million to begin development of a U.S. alternative. This was a wise move, but it's not enough. There are steps that the United States can take now to ensure our access to space and secure our comparative advantage in space -- and in the world. True, development of a new launch system will take time; there are no overnight answers. However, a combination of existing capabilities and dynamic development of new capabilities by the private sector can serve as a foundation for eliminating any capability gap in the U.S. space program. Indeed, new entrants are coming online using launch vehicle systems fully designed and manufactured in America. The two main launch competitors -- United Launch Alliance and SpaceX -- each have all-American systems, namely ULA's Delta IV family of rockets and SpaceX's Falcon 9. Having both options will put America on the path to fielding its indigenous space capabilities for the next generation, while strengthening a space industrial base weakened since the end of the Cold War. The short-term goal should be to transition to existing American-manufactured launch vehicles, as opposed to phasing out systems such as the Delta IV, which continue to provide critical capability. In the long term, next-generation development programs should not involve major Russian subsystems and components. It is time to end America's reliance on Russia's rocket engine. This would be good for national security, good for American innovation and the industrial base -- and good for our country's future.",

In lederhosen and knee-high socks, Adolf Hitler lounges against a tree. The Fuhrer later banned the absurdly camp woodland snap, calling it \u2018beneath one\u2019s dignity\u2019 Hitler seems ill at ease with his hands, squeezing them into his tight lederhosen pockets in one photo, and perching them awkwardly on his hips in another. In one ridiculous picture, he tilts his head and tries a mean and moody stare to camera, topped off by a military cap. It must have felt better than it looked, for after seeing the portrait, he never wore the cap again. In another photo, Hitler tries to strike a casual-yet-serious pose as he balances on the edge of a log cabin veranda showing off his knobbly knees. A snap of him relaxing in a deckchair in a meadow is proof, were it needed, that in those days leaders did not have expert public relations advisers close at hand. The theatrical wartime leader\u2019s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann took many of the black and white photos for Hitler\u2019s own use. But they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) - full of hero worship and pin-up pictures of the Fuhrer, published by his fervent henchman Baldur von Shirach. A tattered copy of the magazine was found by a British soldier in a bombed German house after the war. Souvenir-hunting Pioneer Corps private Alf Roberts, from Barnsley, Yorkshire, brought it home along with a German medal\u00a0and bayonet. Now, 70 years later, military historians have had it translated and are about to publish it in Britain. Von Shirach gushes: \u2018We who have had the privilege of being able to work with him have come to worship and love him.\u2019 He describes the mass-murdering monster as \u2018honest, steadfast and modest\u2019 displaying \u2018strength and kindness\u2019 and whose \u2018soul brushed against the stars\u2019. The theatrical wartime leader\u2019s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann took many of the black and white photos for Hitler\u2019s own use, but they ended up in the Hitler fanzine - Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awaken) His poetic fawning continues page after page, but the magazine is nonetheless a compelling read thanks to the ludicrous vanity of the Fuhrer photos. Von Shirach was only 18 when he met Hitler in Munich in 1925. He quickly moved up the National Socialist ranks through his leadership of the Nazi students association. In 1945 he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in Berlin-Spandau prison. He died in 1974. Photographer Hoffmann died in 1957. He had also introduced Hitler to his assistant, Eva Braun, who became his lover and died with him in 1945. Translation of the \u2018fanzine\u2019 was made difficult by it having been buried in the rubble of a bombed house and having suffered water damage. But with salvaged illustrations and some replacement photos, it is to be published this month by military experts Pen & Sword Books under the title The Rise of Hitler. Translator Trevor Salisbury said: \u2018The book is typical of the propaganda of the time, with the obvious non-critical acceptance of everything Hitler was and what he stood for. \u2018It attempted to present him as a peace-loving man who dearly loved children and was kind to all.

Scroll down for video . Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still far from knowing how it appeared. \u00a0Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid, is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides. It is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life, along with DNA and proteins. The main job of RNA is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome. This prevents the DNA from having to leave the nucleus, and protects it from damage. It also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes. The researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. The study, by the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder, is based on a discovery in the 1980s that RNA can chemically alter its own structure. RNA is similar to DNA, and carries out a number of jobs in our cells, including acting as an on-and-off switch for some genes. Scientists believe that when life was in its early stages, RNA played a leading role in creating complex organisms before DNA and proteins were developed. Many origin-of-life researchers say that RNA chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions. The new study, however, claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in this way instead. The researchers found the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds. These connect together short DNA chains to form long ones, without the need for a separate biological process. The image shows a droplet of condensed nano-DNA and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left. The liquid crystal droplets act as 'micro-reactors' where short DNA can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life . 'Our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early Earth when the first DNA-like molecular fragments appeared,' said CU-Boulder physics Professor Noel Clark, a study co-author. The study suggests that the way in which DNA emerged in the early Earth lies in its structural properties and its ability to self-organise. In the pre-RNA world, the spontaneous self-assembly of fragments of nucleic acids \u2013 the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self-assembly. 'The new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions, the spontaneous self-assembly of small DNA fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers, thereby providing a pre-RNA route to the RNA world,' added Professor Clark.",

Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

Chelsea striker Diego Costa has enjoyed a prolific first season in England after signing from Atletico Madrid . Olivier Giroud has had a fine season despite missing a large chunk of it through injury . In-form Arsenal striker Giroud and Newcastle hitman Cisse have had their seasons interrupted by injury and suspension, while Murray was out on loan at Reading until January. Taking into account only players who have played more than 300 minutes of football, Chelsea have four players in the top 10, including Andre Schurrle, who left for Wolfsburg in January. Costa is expected to miss two weeks of action with a hamstring injury but the minutes-per-goal ratios of Loic Remy and Didier Drogba suggest he won't be too sorely missed - they rank eighth and ninth respectively. Intriguingly, ex-Chelsea veteran Frank Lampard has a marginally better ratio than his Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero and ranks sixth on the list. But Murray, who has scored four goals for Palace in 364 minutes this season, betters them all. Murray slides in to score for Crystal Palace against Arsenal at Selhurst Park back in February .

'I just feel like it really shows our friendship to the next level of where it actually is but people might not see behind closed doors,'\u00a0Mikenzy told WBAY. Scroll down for video . Perfect pair: Mikenzy Snell and\u00a0Matt Pliska, who has Down syndrome, spread an important message about friendship when they were photographed holding this sign at their junior prom in\u00a0Waupaca, Michigan . Since the news outlet first shared the heartwarming picture of Matt and Mikenzy on its Facebook page on March 30, more than 15,000 people have liked the image, ensuring that their prom night will be one that they never forget. After Matt learned that his best friend had been invited to the same dance by somebody else last year, he immediately asked her if she would be his date this time around - and she gladly accepted. And as his date, she did everything she could to make sure that he had a fantastic night. Before prom, Mikenzy took it upon herself to make sure that Matt had the opportunity to be elected onto prom court. When she learned that his name wasn't included in the junior class ballot, which would elect two boys onto prom court, she took it up with the high school office. And although she was initially told it was too late for Matt to be added to the list, she later learned that there was a new ballot with her friend's name on it. Unforgettable night: Mikenzy, who wore a black mermaid gown, posed with her friends for some pre-prom photos . Strike a pose: Matt, who wore a black tux with a bright red vest, threw his jacket over his shoulder for this snapshot . 'We found out later that week he was elected onto prom court,' Mikenzy's mom Carmen told Yahoo Parenting. 'Mikenzy knew that Matt deserved the chance just like everyone else.' Carmen explained that some of her daughter's 'best times' have been with Matt. 'They see movies, go out for dinner and go to watch high school sporting events together,' she said. Matt and Mikenzy first became fast friends in fifth grade after they were partnered together during a class trip. 'He\u2019s such a positive person,' Mikenzy told WBAY. 'He always has a smile on his face.' Meanwhile, when Matt was asked about Mikenzy, he responded: 'Honestly, I love [her].' Celebration: Mikenzy snapped this selfie while holding a champagne flute . Mikenzy, who coaches Special Olympics basketball, said she hopes to one day have a career working with those with\u00a0disabilities, but noted that wherever\u00a0she ends up, she and Matt will remain close. 'I think it\u2019ll be a forever friendship,' she told the outlet. And Matt has plenty of extracurricular activities of his own. The teen, who enjoys bowling, is the team manager for both the boys' hockey team and the girls' soccer team. 'When you have a child that has a disability, they tell you they\u2019re not going to do this, you\u2019re not going to do that,' Matt\u2019s mom Flonnie told WBAY. 'Then you turn around and you watch when they\u2019re growing up.' Good times: Mikenzy, who coaches\u00a0Special Olympics basketball, threw her arms around Matt and another friend for this snapshot . Feeling excited: When Mikenzy shared this Facbook photo yesterday, she revealed that she and Matt were smiling because they received a special phone call from Ellen, believed to be Ellen DeGeneres .",

The Inverness Caley Thistle centre-half will learn on Thursday whether he has been successful in challenging the one-match suspension offered by compliance officer Tony McGlennan. Meekings was charged over the handball that thwarted a Leigh Griffiths effort in their semi-final victory - an incident which also prompted Celtic to write to the SFA seeking \u2018an understanding\u2019 of why no penalty and red card followed. Inverness defender Josh Meekings' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to Celtic on Sunday . Meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match, the punishment he would have got if sent off . But Northern Irishman Boyce, who is also chairman of FIFA\u2019s referees committee, believes the only potential punishment should be levelled at match referee Steven McLean and his assistants. \u2018This sets a very dangerous precedent, I am absolutely, 100 per cent against the compliance officer becoming involved because the referee\u2019s decision is final,\u2019 said Boyce. \u2018It is a totally different matter if someone has gone over the top, or committed a serious foul, or head-butted someone and the referee has missed it. \u2018Those are disciplinary issues. But what happened here is that the referee has made a mistake regarding a hand-ball and that\u2019s the end of it. There is no way the player should now be disciplined for that. \u2018Who is to say it was even intentional? If the Scottish FA or their referees committee decide that they feel a serious mistake was made then they could take action in the future against that referee. \u2018The only punishment, if any punishment at all is due, should be made if the Scottish FA feel the officials in charge of this game acted improperly and made the wrong decision.\u2019 FIFA's head of referees Jim Boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong . Inverness is appealing the ruling that, if upheld, will deny Meekings (right) a place in the Scottish Cup final . The SFA\u2019s disciplinary rules provide scope for action against sending-off offences not seen by the referee, including denying the opposition a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity. And former compliance officer Vincent Lunny believes Meekings should brace himself to miss the showpiece against Falkirk on May 30. \u2018Look at the different options \u2014 any way you look at it, he would have missed the final,\u2019 said Lunny. Meekings (right) celebrates Inverness's 3-2 win over Celtic in their Scottish Cup semi-final . \u2018I suppose it\u2019s natural to feel sympathetic for a player who is potentially missing out on a place in the Scottish Cup Final, which might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance. \u2018But if Steven McLean had seen it at the time, he\u2019d have been sent off and he\u2019d be missing the final had Inverness gone on to win; and if he (Meekings) hadn\u2019t done it, Celtic would have scored and there\u2019s a good chance they would have gone on to win, so again Josh Meekings would have missed the final. \u2018I think it will be an uphill struggle, especially after (Inverness manager) John Hughes\u2019s comments on the radio saying it was a sending-off matter.\u2019",

He was born in Uganda as Anthony Kiyemba, but converted to Islam aged 20, changing his name to Jamal Abdullah. When the family arrived in Britain following the death of his father in 1993, Kiyemba, then 14, was granted indefinite leave to remain, but never applied for British citizenship. Kiyemba was arrested near Peshawar in Pakistan in March 2002, after allegedly trying to enter Afghanistan in the company of 'a probable al-Qaeda operative, a suspected al-Qaeda operative and a low-level jihadist', U.S. military files reveal. Compensated: Kiyemba was awarded \u00a31million from the British government over claims he had been tortured by U.S. intelligence and interrogated by the MI5 at Guantanamo which had violated his human rights . Kiyemba, however, claims he had gone to Pakistan to study Arabic and the Koran because the country was 'very cheap'. Following his 2006 release, he claimed he had only admitted to terrorist activities under torture by American intelligence officers and that he had been interrogated by MI5. He was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years but as he was not a British citizen, he was not entitled to representation by the Foreign Office nor, on his release, to automatic rights to return to his family. Kiyemba, whose mother, four brothers and sister all live in Britain, was instead deported to Uganda, but made several attempts to be allowed back into the UK. 'I may not be British according to some bit of paper but in reality I am a Brit and always will be,' he said in an interview following his release. 'My doctor, my local mosque, my teens, my education, employment, friends, taxes, home and above all else my family - it is all in Britain.' Support: Kiyemba's compensation claims were championed by human rights charity CAGE, whose research director, Asim Qureshi, pictured, famously branded ISIS executioner Jihadi John a 'kind, beautiful' man . Kiyemba was arrested alongside three others in a suburb to Kampala on Tuesday as a result of an operation aided by U.S. officials, Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said. Jamal Kyiemba is one of 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees paid compensation by the British Government over claims of human rights abuse. A total of \u00a320million has been awarded to former prisoners in an out-of-court settlement after they made allegations against British intelligence, the Sun reports. Others include Shaker Aamer, 48, who still remains in Guantanamo after 13 years without charge or trial, despite being cleared for release twice. Once he is released Mr Aamer, from south London, should be entitled to \u00a31million. Ms Kagezi had been a prosecutor in the ongoing trial of 12 suspects accused of being involved in the July 2010 bombings in which 76 people were killed while watching the World Cup final on TV. Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab, who were behind the brutal massacre of nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university this month, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this year, Ms Kagezi had been appointed Head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. Kagezi was shot twice by gunmen after she left her car \u2014 in which she was traveling with two of her children on the way home from work \u2014 to buy groceries in a Kampala suburb. After shooting her in the head and neck, the gunmen fled on a motorcycle, according to police. Ugandan police say there is not yet conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the murder of Ms Kagezi, but that detectives were questioning him about any possible role and about other offenses. Kiyemba has yet to comment on the allegations. Ugandan police on Tuesday arrested at least six suspects.",

The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government\u2019s health promotions agency, which says more action is needed to tackle the \u2018continuing problem\u2019 of \u2018hazardous alcohol consumption in young people\u2019. The move would apply in pubs, clubs, supermarkets and off-licences in Scotland. New measure: Health bosses are considering raising the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 to tackle binge drinking . If introduced it would mean the legal minimum age for buying alcohol would be higher in Scotland than it is in the rest of Britain, where it is 18. Last night Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said he would welcome the minimum age being set at 21. He said: \u2018If it was 21 now, I would not be calling for it to be lowered.\u2019 But he added: \u2018Given the fact that we are where we are, I think that politically it is quite difficult, when the age is 18 for so many other adult rites in our society.\u2019 The proposal to raise the legal age is outlined in a report titled \u2018Best Preventative Investments for Scotland \u2013 What the Evidence and Experts Say\u2019, which examines mea-sures to improve public health. It says the idea to \u2018increase the minimum legal drinking age to 21 would be highly cost-effective, as it would both improve people\u2019s health without having to spend much money, and reduce demand on the NHS\u2019. Report author Neil Craig said: \u2018In Scotland, hazardous alcohol consumption in young people is a continuing problem. \u2018For both males and females, the largest increase in hospitalisation rates for alcohol-related conditions since the early 1980s has been in the 15-24 year olds, and this was particularly marked for females.\u2019 In fact, doctors across the whole of Britain are worried about the increase in such hospitalisations. Between 2002 and 2010, the number of admissions to English hospitals among 15 to 24 year olds due to alcohol rose by 66 per cent to 55,655 \u2013 or more than 150 a day. The proposal has been put forward by experts at NHS Health Scotland, the Scottish Government\u2019s health promotions agency . The increase among women (76 per cent) was higher than in men (57 per cent). While the Government in Westminster has been reluctant to legislate to tackle the alcohol problem, the Scottish Government has had far fewer reservations. It has already agreed a 50p minimum unit price for alcohol, although the controversial move will not be implemented if the Scottish Whisky Association succeeds in an ongoing court battle to block it. The Scottish Government has also banned \u2018BOGOF\u2019 (buy-one-get-one-free) deals and other offers encouraging bulk-buying of alcohol, and reduced the drink driving limit. A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u2018We remain open to the consideration of any evidence-based proposals that can contribute to reducing alcohol-related harm.\u2019 A Department of Health spokesman in London said: \u2018There are no plans to increase the legal age for buying alcohol.\u2019",

The horse, Charly, was patrolling Venice Beach with his minders on Tuesday when the vandalism incident occurred. It was broad daylight, and somehow the person managed to spray Charlie without the handlers seeing - a move that taggers pride themselves on, but usually with stationary objects and facades. 'I think it's unfortunate, but people love to tag things in Venice, so really, I guess a horse is just the next step,' local Mark Stegall told CBS\u00a0LA. Vandalized: Charly was patrolling Venice Beach with\u00a0with his minders Tuesday when the cruel tagger managed to write 'RBS' and an arrow on the horse's flank with silver spray paint . 'It's cruel and it's not respectful,' another local, Robert Kendall, said. 'It's bad for the animals and it's just people who want to mess with the status quo and I think it's pretty awful.' However, tags are cryptic signatures, and authorities are hoping they will be able to track down the person responsible using the tag, which was 'RBS'. A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram. All clean: The paint came off relatively easily, but police are still trying to find the person responsible . 'RBS': The key to finding the tagger likely lies in deciphering the tag, RBS, and working out who it belongs to . A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram . The paint was cleaned off Charly later on Tuesday night without a problem. However the LAPD has requested the public's help in identifying the person responsible. Anyone with information was asked to contact detectives at 310-482-6313. Anyone wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477).",
