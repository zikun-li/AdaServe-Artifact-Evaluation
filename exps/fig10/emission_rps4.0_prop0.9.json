Three-time winner Faldo has confirmed he will cross the famous Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory on the Old Course, having also lifted the Claret Jug at Muirfield in 1987 and 1992. Faldo, whose 58th birthday falls on the Saturday of the championship, said: 'The Open and St Andrews will forever hold a significant place in my heart. My fondest moments on my journey with this great sport are woven with pictures and emotions in this setting. It all means a huge amount to me. Sir Nick Faldo (left) and Tom Watson will compete at The Open for the last time at St Andrews in July . Watson will walk across the Swilcan Bridge for the final time on the 25th anniversary of his victory there . 'I look forward to celebrating all that golf has given me as I cross that storied bridge and the wonderful memories I share with many people. I am grateful for it all and grateful to golf.' R&A chief executive Peter Dawson added: 'Sir Nick Faldo is an inspirational figure in British golf and has enjoyed a remarkable career in The Open. 'He has delighted the galleries over many years with his three victories and consistently outstanding performances. I'm sure there will be great anticipation among the galleries at St Andrews to see him play in The Open once again and he will receive a rousing ovation worthy of a great champion.' Five-time Open champion Watson, who lost a play-off at Turnberry in 2009 at the age of 59, received a special exemption from the R&A to play his final Open in 2015, the 40th anniversary of his first victory at Carnoustie. He and Faldo will be joined by the likes of Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson in the Champion Golfers' Challenge on Wednesday, July 15, a four-hole team event played on the first, second, 17th and 18th on the eve of the championship. Almost 10,000 spectators will be able to watch from seats on the first, 17th and 18th, with a two-tiered grandstand created behind the 18th green for the first time and an L-shaped arena behind the 17th green, as well as the traditional seats to the right of the first. The grandstand behind the famous Road Hole will have a capacity of more than 4,000, with a total of 21,000 seats around the entire course. Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, executive director of championships at the R&A, said: 'There is always an incredible atmosphere at The Open and particularly when it is held in St Andrews. We want to make sure as many spectators as possible can experience that unique atmosphere and enjoy wonderful views of the play on the opening and closing holes at St Andrews. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson paid tribute to the achievements of Faldo during his career . Tom Watson (right) poses with the Claret Jug alongside runner-up in 1975, Jack Newton (left) Rory McIlroy is the current holder of the Claret Jug and will defend the title at St Andrews this year . 'The new arena will provide a fantastic setting for the climax of the Championship at the 72nd hole and will be the ideal place for spectators to greet the new champion golfer of the year.' Several cameras have been implanted into bunkers on the course, with another 'turf camera' giving views of the R&A clubhouse from in front of the first tee. The R&A has also invested \u00a3150,000 in subsidising food and drink prices, meaning the price of fish and chips, for example, is down from \u00a310.50 to \u00a38.50.",

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Last year: Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt last November \u00a0after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game against Hiram University . Never give up: Lauren, picture on March 22, is vowing to never give up her battle with rare brain cancer . A team player: Lauren is working with her doctors and family to fight the disease that will likely kill her . Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center at hospital) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain .",

Derek Skyler Brux, 22, was sentenced to five years probation for taking a train from a coal mine and crashing it into another train last fall. He must also pay $63,000 in restitution to Rail Link, his employer . He was preparing to hit the train a third time when a Rail Link employee was able to get on the engine train and press the fuel cut-off switch, according to K2 Radio. Brux was working at his job at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine, where he had been employed as a utility coal operator for three years, when he received the phone call that upset him on October 9. The details of what exactly his supervisor said were not included in available court documents. During the sentencing on Friday, U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl told Brux he needed to deal with his anger and mental health issues. Brux's public defender David Weiss previous told the court his client had struggled with bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the past. But Brux was able to avoid prison time and instead must serve five years of probation. He also must pay over $63,000 in restitution to Rail Link.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA bowel cancer patient told he had just 18 months to live claims he has been cured by  cannabis oil. David Hibbitt, 33, was diagnosed with the disease in July 2012 and underwent\u00a0chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery to remove his large bowel. Doctors told him the cancer was terminal - so he decided to try cannabis oil as a last resort and bought it from a local dealer for \u00a350 a gram. Now the father-of-one says he has been cancer-free since his last scan in January \u00a0- and puts the class-B drug down to his miracle recovery. David Hibbitt, 33, claims doctors said he had between 18 months and five years to live after being diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. In desperation, he tried cannabis oil, which he now credits with his recovery . He is now looking forward to the future after tying the knot with his partner of six years Heather Martin, 26, at a registry office today. Mr Hibbitt, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'Friends had told me about cannabis oil and I dismissed it at first. I've never been into drugs. 'But in February last year I was told I only had 18 months to five years to live, and I felt I had to try everything I could. 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die.' After going online to research his options, he discovered a lot of information about cannabis oil - and decided to try it. 'I pay around \u00a350 for a gram from a bloke I know who makes it,' he said. 'That lasts me about a month usually. 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy. 'The pain just seemed to disappear and it seems to have done the job. 'I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there.' Mr Hibbitt was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer after initially being told he was suffering from piles. Mr Hibbitt, with fiance Heather, said: 'I felt like the chemo was killing me and I had nothing to lose. I couldn't accept I was going to die' After undergoing treatment at the Christie Hospital, in Manchester, the cancer returned and he had another operation in July 2013 followed by more chemotherapy. He was given the all-clear before Christmas that year, but a month later he found a lump, and was told the cancer was in the lymph nodes in his groin. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn't good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'Researchers are collecting patients' experiences to build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabinoid-based drugs in order to gather solid data on whether they benefit people with cancer.' Mr Hibbitt, who works in advertising, added: 'This time they told me there wasn't a lot they could do. 'In July, after doing a lot of research, I got some cannabis oil. I was having chemo, and I was getting to a point where I couldn't really do much, I had no energy. 'In August I decided I'd had enough and I was going to stop the chemotherapy. In October, he had an operation to remove the affected lymph nodes at the Royal Stoke University Hospital. But he chose to carry on taking cannabis oil rather than have any more treatment, deciding against further chemotherapy sessions. Following a scan in January he was given the all-clear - paving the way for him to organise his wedding. Mr Hibbitt, who has a five-year-old son, Ashton, said: 'We never thought this would happen, it's great. Fingers crossed now I will grow old. 'I feel really good and I hope my story will help other people.' His fiance Heather, a nursery nurse, said: 'I didn't want him to take the cannabis oil at first because it's illegal, but I saw the change in him and slowly got used to it. 'He is a determined person and did a lot of research. He wanted to live. 'We are all amazed how well he's done. I can't see my life without him. We have come through a hell of a lot.' Describing the effects of cannabis oil, he said: 'It gets your pretty high and knocks you for six, but it's nowhere near as bad as chemotherapy.The pain just seemed to disappear. I just want to make other people aware that there are other options out there' Cancer Research UK says it is aware of patients using cannabis extracts to treat themselves but stressed there is 'no good evidence'  to prove it was safe and effective. The charity is supporting clinical trials into the use of the drug and a synthetic cannabinoid to treat the disease. Dr Kat Arney, from Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids - the active chemicals found in cannabis - can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nAn obsessive Arsenal fan made his girlfriend sit a test quizzing her about his favourite football club. Marking her answers with red pen, she scored an impressive 43.5 out of 50, to which he commented, 'Well done Saskia! As a result, I will not be dumping you! (Lucky you)'. Saskia posted snaps of the test to her Twitter account, @saskiaisabxlla, commenting 'Boyfriend made me take an @Arsenal exam!' with emoticons showing she didn't know whether to laugh or cry. We don't blame her. Saskia's football fan boyfriend made her take an Arsenal test and didn't dump her thanks to her A grade . The test took the form of a school exam, with multiple choice questions, tables to complete, and 'in your own words...' section. There were even 'helpful' instructions including 'Read every question at least twice' and 'Check your answers if you have time at the end'. Oh, and 'calculators may be used'. Saskia scored an impressive 87 per cent, but according to her unnamed boyfriend's feedback she 'could have performed better on Q17', needs to 'Learn ALL player positions' and should understand that 'Tottenham are scum'. What does the 'FC' in Arsenal FC stand for? What is the nickname for Arsenal fans? Who is the current manager of Arsenal? Is the kit below (see picture) Arsenal#s current Home kit or Away kit? Name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions. In your own words, explain why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard. Who are our top 2 goalscorers of the season so far? What was the scoreline for the 2014 FA Cup Final vs Hull City? What player scored the winning goal in the 204 FA Cup Final? a) Olivier Giroud . b) Santi Cazorla . c) Aaron Ramsey . d) Per Mertesacker . Why are Arsenal the best team to ever grace English football? Questions put to her in the test included: . 'What was the scoreline for the 2014 FA Cup Final vs Hull City?', . 'What player scored the winning goal in the 2014 FA Cup Final?' 'Name the starting 11 squad of this season in their relevant positions.' She struggled to come up with the 11th player of the starting  squad (Koscielny, defence, apparently) and thought Ozil was defence and Wellbeck a midfielder, when in fact they are midfield and striker respectively. Tut tut. She scored some decent points for her more creative answers. Asked to explain why Alexis Sanchez is better than Eden Hazard in her own words, she wrote, 'Sanchez is buff, scores lots of goals, Hazard is a p***k, Sanchez is Chilean'. She got double marks for the Hazard comment, but only got half a point for the last one. Saskia clearly knows how to keep her boyfriend happy, as she humoured his question of 'Why are Arsenal the best team to ever grace English football?' with the answer of 'They've won many FA Cups' and 'Thierry Henry is a legend'. However, when she got an answer wrong, her examiner wrote the correct answer in capitals and drew an angry face. This man clearly means business. Doh! Saskia struggled to name all 11 players of the starting squad and got confused on the player positions . Saskia's boyfriend drew an angry face when she got a question wrong - this man means business . Saskia kept her boyfriend happy with creative answers to his questions, and got double marks for some... He was impressed with the end result, though, grading her an 'A' and rewarding her by not ending their relationship. And they say romance is dead. Comments generally hailed the man as a 'legend' and fellow football fans were impressed with Saskia's knowledge. Some Twitter users hailed the unnamed boyfriend who tested Saskia on her Arsenal knowledge as a legend . Scoring 87%, football fans were impressed with Saskia, claiming her as 'proper GF material' May men felt inspired, with @lewisxweeked warning his girlfriend to 'get revising' Indeed, @gstarrs85 congratulated Saskia and stating that she was 'proper GF material'. Plenty of men felt inspired by the post, with @lewisxweekes telling his girlfriend @LayciJade to 'get revising' and @DigsXIII crying 'WHERE CAN I GET THIS TEST FROM?' Others, though, felt that the boyfriend had taken things a tad too far. @GunSaurEd11 stated 'football fans are nuts', and @DCSLFC commented 'Imagine actually broadcasting that your boyfriend is the biggest biff-head ever to the world.' We reckon it was  a bit of fun and he wouldn't really have dumped her if she'd failed... at least we like to think that's the case. Trimothy wants to put his girlfriend to the test, although apparently can't be bothered to create his own exam . Eduardo claims 'football fans are nuts' despite appearing to be one as he holds what looks suspiciously like the FA Cup in his hands... Some thought Saskia's boyfriend took things too far with @DCSLFC creatively naming him a 'biff-head'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland (CNN)Protesters angry over the death of Freddie Gray got into physical altercations with police Saturday night in downtown Baltimore near the city's famed baseball stadium. Some of the hundreds who confronted lines of  police officers got into shoving matches with helmeted cops while other demonstrators threw objects. At least five police cars were damaged by people who smashed windows and jumped on them. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was profoundly disappointed by the violence, adding that 95% of the protesters were respectful but a \"small group of agitators intervened.\" Twelve people were arrested, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. \"We continue to have a few isolated pockets of individuals causing disturbances. We are deploying resources to keep everyone safe,\" the Baltimore Police Department tweeted. Fredericka Gray, the twin sister of Freddie Gray, made a statement: \"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence? Freddie Gray would not want this.' Freddie's father and mother do not want any violence. Violence does not get justice.\" Vandals broke and damaged storefront windows and trashed one 7-Eleven, police said. CNN crews observed a window damaged at a Michael Kors store and holes in one at a Subway restaurant. The skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on April 12. He died a week later. The numbers of protesters dissipated substantially just before sunset, though some people were still walking in the streets near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, causing some traffic problems. Earlier, demonstrators had marched through the streets until they arrived at City Hall. Along the way, whenever it appeared the protest might get out of control, organizers reined the marchers back in. The event ended after speeches at Baltimore City Hall on Saturday evening, but many protesters continued to vent their anger by marching down to Inner Harbor. When demonstrators got to the stadium, tensions escalated and some people threw what appeared to be water bottles and other objects at the cops, who wore helmets and stood behind metal barricades. Fans who were arriving to watch the hometown Orioles play the Boston Red Sox were having trouble finding ways to the entrance gates. The Orioles won the game 5-4 in extra innings. For a time it appeared that fans would be held inside the ballpark until the demonstration quieted, but the gates were opened before the contest was over. Throughout the day, protesters yelled, \"No justice, no peace\" and \"All night, all day; we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray.\" The police department used Twitter to update the public on the progress of the march. At City Hall, speakers demanded justice for the Gray family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects. At least one protest organizer had promised in advance that the event would be big enough to shut down the city, but while many people turned out and walked, the major disruption was only to traffic on a few streets. Gray died last Sunday. Protesters have marched since, outraged by the arrest, which was recorded on a bystander's cell phone and the nature of Gray's death. The witness said Gray was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. At some point after he was detained, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. On Friday, police officials said that Gray should have received medical care at the site of his arrest and at other times as he was transported to a police station. The van carrying him stopped three times on its way to the station where he was to be booked, but when it arrived at the Western District officers called for an ambulance, which took him to a hospital. The questions investigators are looking into are: How and where did Gray suffer a severe spinal injury? And are police liable for his death? The preliminary work on his autopsy has been done, but the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and may invite spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report may take 30 to 45 days. Batts told reporters on Friday there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care \"multiple times.\" Those comments upset members of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police. \"We are disappointed in the comments made yesterday by Commissioner Anthony Batts, and various members of his command staff, relative to the actions of the officers directly involved in the Gray investigation,\" Gene Ryan, president of the organization said in a written statement. \"These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete.\" Police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. A wake for Gray will be held Sunday, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday.

Is it heart ruling the head among the United faithful? Or is there a genuine belief that serial winner Louis van Gaal is about to re-assert himself at the very top again? Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Van Gaal poses for pictures with United fans at the training ground during a day for the club's foundation . Van Gaal (pictured talking to fans) is starting to assert himself at the United after a stuttering start . If he is to take United back to the very top, he\u2019ll need more than Memphis Depay. I\u2019ve already established in this column recently that Van Gaal is a great, and he is a winner. I love the fact he has set himself this huge challenge of resurrecting a fallen giant at the end of his career. The Dutchman knows, however, he will not be judged on his ability to repair the damage done by David Moyes. At the end of his (albeit shorter) Old Trafford stay, his record will need to stand comparison with that of Sir Alex Ferguson. Obviously Van Gaal cannot win the same number of trophies Sir Alex picked up during his 27 year reign, so relatively speaking what does he need to achieve to be considered a success at United? Sir Alex underachieved in Europe: only two Champions League wins in his time \u2013 just one more than Liverpool in the same period, and the same number as Jose Mourinho (who won those in significantly fewer years). Van Gaal has also underachieved in this department \u2013 his only Champions League win was with Ajax, not Bayern Munich or Barcelona. Van Gaal will be hungry to add to that success which came 20 years ago. He should target Euro success as soon as possible. Domestically, United still don\u2019t quite look like the finished article, despite their impressive run in 2015. But they should at least be challenging for the title next season. So what needs to change for United to reach that level where they are in the mix to win the Premier League and the Champions League? Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his second Champions League triumph with United in 2008 . Van Gaal celebrates winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 - his only triumph in Europe . Keeping David de Gea would be ideal, but Victor Valdes has winning experience and there is a bond between the former Barcelona keeper and the manager after their time together at the Nou Camp. Van Gaal blooded Valdes and then man-managed him superbly. Either keeper is fine, it\u2019s obvious who would be preferred though. United need a quality right back \u2013 Nathaniel Clyne has been linked and the Southampton man would be perfect. If Clyne is the right fit, Luke Shaw needs to stay fit. He\u2019s been like a rabbit in the headlights this first season, but he\u2019s dealt with Van Gaal\u2019s brutally honest management style well and put in a fine performance at Chelsea. I\u2019ve said before, Shaw has the potential to be an all-time great at United. At centre half, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling might become the trusted partnership, or wisdom may win the day and United could go and get Mats Hummels from Borussia Dortmund. He\u2019s a winner and a leader \u2013 perfect for United. Luke Shaw (right) has had a difficult start to his United career but impressed against Chelsea . Mats Hummels (left) of Dortmund is a player who has long been linked with a move to United . In midfield, United are strong in my view \u2013 Daley Blind and Michael Carrick can fight for that anchor spot, or even play together depending on the opposition. I can\u2019t help thinking that adding another Carrick-type player to the squad might be a wise move for Van Gaal. United fans are seeing the best of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini in this current period, while Juan Mata and Ashley Young have been big positives this season. Wayne Rooney\u2019s quality and contribution as United captain is never up for debate \u2013 for me he should be the closest challenger to Eden Hazard for Player of the Year. Which leaves players like Adnan Januzaj, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria. Ander Hererra (holding off Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas) has impressed for United in recent weeks . Juan Mata (right) is starting to show his best form after moving from Chelsea last January . Angel di Maria (centre) has struggled this season but to leave him leave would be a massive risk for United . United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . Januzaj has stalled a little bit after bursting onto the scene, but he may yet come good. Van Persie would be brilliant off the bench next season \u2013 he\u2019s still capable of scoring important goals. The two South Americans are expensive stellar players, but neither have impressed in their first season in English football. To let both leave would be a gamble \u2013 European rivals will pick them up, and if they suddenly re-discover their game, United will look foolish. Keeping both is also a risk, but one worth taking if you add one more world-class attacking player. And that\u2019s why United need to go all out to get Gareth Bale. At times this season United have been so slow in their build up. Bale brings dynamism, goals and energy to a side. He could flourish at United, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s shadow at Real Madrid. United have already enquired about PSV\u2019s Depay, he has all the skills and end product to be loved at Old Trafford, but United still need that marquee man to humiliate opposing defences at home and abroad. Memphis Depay (left, in action for PSV) is a prime target for United and has the potential to be a great signing . Gareth Bale has the dynamism, goals and energy that United have missed in their side this season . Van Gaal signed a three-year deal. If he wins the Premier League and the Champions League in that time he will be considered a total success at United. It\u2019s a tough ask, but he could win both next season. Given his record of winning titles elsewhere, I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule that out. I suspect the United haters will have to calm themselves down over the next few seasons. Did they really think United would be gone for long?",

United\u2019s shirt sponsors Chevrolet are keen for the club to visit the Far East as the American car giant seeks to expand its business in that part of the world and were enthusiastic about that trip taking place this summer. However, after months of discussions between the United board and manager Van Gaal the club will once again head across the Atlantic for a four-game tour signed off by the manager. Manchester United's pre-season tour of the United States will see them play Louis van Gaal's ex-club Barca . The pre-season plans have been organised to Van Gaal's liking after he was unhappy last year in USA . The Premier League giants will face Club America, San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona and PSG . United will play once again in the International Champions\u2019 Cup, the tournament they won in America last summer. This time, though, with Van Gaal\u2019s influence over all matters of club business growing ever stronger, the club will squeeze four games in to 12 days before heading back to England on July 30 in order to recover in time for the start of the Barclays Premier League season on August 8. July 17 - vs\u00a0Club America . CenturyLink Field, Seattle - 72,000 capacity . July 21 - vs\u00a0San Jose Earthquakes . TBC . July 25 - vs\u00a0Barcelona . Levi's Stadium, California - 68,500 capacity . July 29 - vs\u00a0Paris Saint-Germain . Soldier Field, Chicago - 61,500 capacity . Van Gaal was furious last summer with the amount of travelling United had to do as they zig-zagged around America, playing games in Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. This time, United will be based largely on the west coast, playing games against Club America in Seattle, San Jose Earthquakes, at a venue to be announced and Barcelona near San Francisco before facing PSG in Chicago on the way home. As revealed earlier this month in Sportsmail, the tournament organisers have essentially organised this summer\u2019s tournament around United\u2019s needs. For example, there will be no final this year in order to avoid last summer\u2019s rather delicate situation that saw an irritated Van Gaal having to take his team to Miami for four days for a game he really had no desire to play. It is understood that United will use Seattle as their base before their first game this summer. Next summer\u2019s tour, meanwhile, will almost certainly be to Asia, a continent United haven\u2019t visited since David Moyes\u2019 pre-season of 2013. Ander Herrera, David De Gea and Juan Mata (left to right) hold the trophy after beating Liverpool in Miami . The squad reached the final of the 2014 International Champions Cup, but had travelled about 13,500 miles . July 24 - Manchester United 7-0 LA Galaxy (Pasadena) Attendance: 86,432 . July 26 - Manchester United 3-2 Roma (Denver) Attendance: 54, 117 . July 30 - Manchester United 0-0 Inter Milan (Washington) Attendance: 61,238 .

In a case that was condemned around the world, Luo Kun Kun was expelled from his village when locals - including his own grandfather - signed a petition to banish him to 'protect villagers' health'. Following that cold-hearted decision, the mournful child explained how, 'nobody plays with me, I play alone'. But now a specialist school in Linfen, a city in southern Shanxi Province, has stepped in to help. The Red Ribbon School is the only school in China equipped to look after and educate HIV-positive children. Kun Kun was refused admission to\u00a0schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone . The five-year-old has now been admitted a place at the Red Ribbon School in Linfen, China, . After being banished from his village, Kun Kun finally has a home where he is cared for and looked after . Kun Kun contracted the virus from his mother when she was pregnant with him, but was only diagnosed when he was five years old. His mother and stepfather worked in other provinces, so he was raised near the town of Xichong with his non-blood-related grandparents, who had adopted his stepfather as a child. The boy was refused admission to local schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. When he was diagnosed, his grandparents found themselves isolated in their village of Shufangya in south-eastern China's Sichuan province\u00a0and so sided with the locals. At a special meeting on December 7 last year, 203 village residents signed a petition asking the authorities to 'carry out preventative isolation measures by taking Kun Kun away from the village, and protect the health of the villagers and children'. It went on to say that Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community'. He was also referred to as a 'ticking time bomb'. Wang Yishu, party chief of Shufangya village, said: 'The villagers sympathise with him, he is innocent, and only a small child. But his AIDS is too scary for us'. Kun Kun was forced to play alone in his home village, but has now been admitted to a specialist school . The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's plight made worldwide headlines . However the future is now looking up for Kun Kun, after he was given a place at the boarding school last week. The Sichuan government contacted the school in Linfen when Kun Kun's desperate plight made worldwide headlines. Headteacher Guo Xiaoping said: 'A good social and educational environment is important for Kun Kun and with the help of teachers, he is more open and polite than before'. He added: 'Kun Kun's physical strength is notably below that of the other students. Fortunately, he has been sent here in time, and started taking medication last November. At Kunkun's age, it's crucial that he undergoes proper treatment.' Kun Kun did not say a word when he arrived at the school, according to the headteacher, but can study and talk like a normal student now. The devastating case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China . The child was forced out of his village when villagers signed a petition asking the authorities to remove him . The petition signed by villagers said Kun Kun 'provokes fear among the community' and referred to him as a 'ticking time bomb' Knowledge of HIV/AIDS in China is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from . Kun Kun was banished from the village of Shufangya, near\u00a0the town of Xichong (shown on this map) The case of Kun Kun has highlighted the stigma attached to the disease in China, where many sufferers face widespread discrimination. The problem is so great, even medical workers sometimes refuse to touch those diagnosed with the disease. The latest figures released by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission showed a total of 497,000 people in China have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS since the country's first case in 1985. China has a population of 1.36billion. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS is worse in poor, rural areas, such as the community Kun Kun is from, experts have said. Officials are reportedly planning to educate the villagers who banished Kun Kun through a campaign. The Nanjing-based anti-discrimination NGO Justice for All wrote a letter to party chiefs in Sichuan calling on them to punish school chiefs and local officials for their 'Cultural Revolution style', a reference to the Mao Zedong-inspired public denunciations of 'foes'. 'We cannot imagine how Kun Kun will grow up and look back on the experience of childhood,' said a draft of the letter.",

David Howman, director general of WADA, said this week that he is disappointed Armstrong had not apologised for costly and time-consuming lawsuits before the former cycling champion admitted using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong initially declined comment on Howman's remark, but on Wednesday provided the AP with a May 2013 email exchange with Howman, who initially indicted he could meet with Armstrong, then backed off under advice from WADA lawyers. Lance Armstrong admits groups such as WADA, USADA and others are owed an apology for his offences . WADA director general David Howman said this week that he was disappointed Armstrong hadn't apologised . 'I can talk at a suitable time and at a suitable place ... What do you suggest?' Howman responded to Armstrong's first inquiry about a meeting. A few days later, after Armstrong recounted his upcoming schedule, Howman broke off the discussion. 'Having reflected upon your request to meet with me, and having taken advice from our lawyers, it is apparent that it is a situation where little, if anything, can be gained from such a meeting,' Howman wrote Armstrong. Howman did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment. Armstrong won the Tour de France every year from 1999-2005. Those titles were stripped after a massive report in 2012 by the US Anti-Doping Agency detailed doping by Armstrong and his US Postal Service teammates. In the email, Howman said he told Armstrong's attorneys months earlier they should meet with USADA. Although the intent of the meeting request with Howman is not relayed in emails, Armstrong said Wednesday he reached out to Howman in hopes of discussing a potential 'truth and reconciliation' effort to confront doping in cycling. Armstrong first declined comment on Howman's remark but then revealed his attempt to meet him in 2013 . Armstrong's agreement to take part in a Tour de France charity ride with former England footballer Geoff Thomas has caused controversy with some in cycling saying his presence at the event is disrespectful . A probe into the sport's doping problems was later conducted by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission, which met twice with Armstrong and issued its report in March. Part of the report detailed Armstrong's efforts to debunk a report by the French newspaper L'Equipe that found his urine samples from the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO, a hormone that helps endurance. The UCI hired Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman to investigate the findings and the probe produced a report that Vrijman claimed exonerated Armstrong and instead blamed WADA and the testing lab. Amstrong holds up seven fingers, one for each of the Tour de France titles that were later stripped from him; and former UCI president Pat McQuaid at the 2012 press conference in Geneva that delivered his fate . The report released last month detailed how Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to help write the report that criticized WADA. Armstrong said he doesn't know if he would have apologised to Howman had they met in 2013, but it would have been a chance to do it in person. 'I was in a different headspace,' Armstrong said. 'There's no doubt that a lot of people like them, like USADA, are owed an apology.' Armstrong said there's been no attempt to meet with Howman since 2013.",

After speaking to President Barack Obama on the phone, he said in a televised statement just hours after the agreement was signed on Thursday: 'A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel. He added: 'Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it.' Scroll down for video . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Iran nuclear deal, claiming it threatens the Jewish state and puts his people in mortal danger . One of Netanyahu's scathing comments was shared on his Twitter page during his speech . The preliminary agreement set out a framework where Iran would scale down plans to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium in return for Western powers dropping stringent economic sanctions. They will also be subjected to inspections. If they are found to be in violation of the terms, the sanctions will be put back in place. The deal does mean however that Iran's nuclear program will be able to operate for the next 10 years, even though it is ceasing its enrichment activities at Fordow - an underground facility discovered by the Americans. It prompted Netanyahu\u00a0to urge more pressure to be placed on Iran by Western powers until a better deal is reached. He said: 'This deal would legitimize Iran's nuclear program, bolster Iran's economy, increase Iran's aggression & terror throughout the ME [Middle East] & beyond. 'Such a deal would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it. 'Such a deal would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war. 'The alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on Iran until a better deal is achieved. In response, The White House said in a statement, seen by NBC, that 'progress on the nuclear issue in no way diminishes our concerns with respect to Iran's sponsorship of terrorism and threats towards Israel,' adding that 'the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to the security of Israel.' The deal made in\u00a0Lausanne, Switzerland was announced by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and the European Union's head of foreign policy Federica Mogherini. They said negotiators had reached an agreement with Tehran over its nuclear program and talks would move into the next phase. After speaking to President Barack Obama (pictured Thursday during the announcement of the agreement) on the phone, he said in a statement: 'A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel . Obama (pictured making a speech on the economy in Louisville, Kentucky' added that if Iran follows through then one of the greatest threats to American security will be resolved . Speaking in the Rose Garden on Thursday, Obama said: 'If we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully. But, he added: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.' And 'If there is backsliding' and Iran doesn't meet certain specifications 'there will be no deal.' As Zarif and Mogherini were preparing to give a joint statement in Lausanne, Switzerland, this afternoon Iranian President Hassan Rhouianni tweeted: 'Solutions on key parameters of Iran case reached. Drafting to start immediately, to finish by June 30th.' Zarif insisted that the program is 'exclusively peaceful' and will remain that way as the framework takes shape. From left Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond speaks to US Secretary of State John Kerry as European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifat take their positions before making a statement on the Iranian deal . U.S Secretary of State John Kerry admitted there was still progress to be made when the deal was signed. He said: 'We have no illusions about the fact that we have a ways to travel. We still have many technical details that have to be addressed.' British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond also said there was much more work to be done, but highlighted the success of the talks. He said: 'This is well beyond what many of us thought possible even 18 months ago and a good basis for what I believe could be a very good deal. ' German Chancellor Angela Merkel added: 'We are closer than ever to an agreement that makes it impossible for Iran to possess nuclear weapons. That is a great credit to all negotiating partners.' The White House had repeatedly said that in order for it to enter into a commitment with Tehran it must promise to 'shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon' and 'comply with intrusive inspections that would ensure that they\u2019re living up to the agreement.' The date for work on that accord to be completed is June 30. The preliminary agreement announced in Switzerland on Thursday is spelled out in a four-page document (below) released by the White House and the State Department. Here's some of what Iran is agreeing to do: . In return, the West will: . Obama insisted that: 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it'.

Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, \"Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,\"' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS.\u00a0A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.",

The bathroom debacle caused people to wait more than one hour to get to one of only two working bathrooms and according to those who were there, some were left with no choice but to relieve themselves while standing in line. Traumatized fans uploaded pictures to social media showing the intense queues and plastic glasses filled with urine, as the modernization of Wrigley Field reduced the famous stadium to a potential public health disaster. Scroll down for video . Busting: The line for the restroom can be seen snaking its way to the bathroom which is visible in the top left of the picture . Almost there: Disgruntled and disgusted fans uploaded pictures to social media revealing their trauma in getting to the bathroom . Indeed, the Cubs admitted as much on Sunday as thousands of the 35,000 fans in attendance struggled to get to the bathroom. 'Opening Day at Wrigley Field has always brought challenges with wait times and tonight was particularly extreme,' Cubs spokesman Julian Green said in a statement published after the Cubs had lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0. Stinking the field and the stands out, the Cubs and Wrigley Field claimed the problem began when two bathrooms on the upper deck 'went down temporarily.' This came at a time when the stadium was 'already experiencing issues with long wait times.' Social media was flooded with complaints. Opening day: A general shot of Wrigley Field during batting practice prior to a game between the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday night . 'I'm all for renovating, but I've now missed two innings trying to get into the bathroom,' said James Hillebrand in a tweet. While Cubs fan Russ Stubenruch said, 'The lines were obnoxiously long compared to what you would normally get.' One fan who identified herself as Libby, told Deadspin that the whole scene was a horror show. 'Yes, fans were peeing in cups tonight. They were peeing EVERYWHERE. I heard there were only two working bathrooms- I know the lines were horrific and I also know that some were shut down early on because toilets just wouldn't flush.' Cubs spokesman Julian Green said that 'with 35,000 fans showing up in the ballpark tonight, we were simply not prepared to handle guests during peak periods. We have high standards for service and we missed the mark tonight. 'We want to apologize to our fans for the inconvenience tonight,' he added. 'Moving forward we plan to supplement the existing restrooms with additional portable units and will continue to monitor wait times.'",

Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school, an inquest into her death was told. Miss Nigam would stay up late studying, resulting in sleep deprivation and a negative impact on her performance at school - which caused further depression and anxiety. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford heard the teenager, who had been a volunteer at the London Olympics in 2012, was also worried about her appearance. An inquest heard Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from an obsession to do well at school. Stock photo . Tragically, she had first told her parents she was feeling suicidal in 2013 and had even said she would stand in front of a fast train on a Tuesday to take her life - which is how she ultimately died. Miss Nigam had seen a number of doctors over several years, but her father Ankush Nigam\u00a0told the inquest that she had often refused treatment. He explained that he felt he was 'torturing' his daughter by making her attend appointments - and eventually accepted that she would one day take her life. On February last year, the teenager was struck by a train travelling from London Paddington to Hereford at Twyford railway station in Berkshire. In a statement to the court, train driver Stephen Wood said he saw a pair of legs running into his view from the right as he approached the station. Mr Wood said: 'I saw a person turn towards me and spread their arms wide apart. The train struck this person.' The driver had applied the emergency brake and paramedics were called to the scene, but Miss Nigam, from Lower Earley, Berkshire, died instantly from multiple injuries. Mr Nigam said: 'I'm glad she's in a peaceful place.' He said his daughter first started showing signs of depression and sleep deprivation at 13 and had been on various medication since. The teenager was struck by a train in February last year at Twyford railway station (pictured) in Berkshire . Her doctors had believed she showed improvement when on medication, but she was often reluctant to take it. And Mr Nigam criticised doctors for not believing him and his wife when she said their daughter's condition was worse than she presented to medics. She told doctors she did not want medication for her condition and was not judged to be a suicide risk. But Mr Nigam said his concerns were not taken seriously, even when he explained she had told her parents how she would kill herself in October 2013. He said his daughter had said she knew the times of fast trains and that it would be on a Tuesday. 'That was the first time she made a comment in respect of the train,' he said. 'She clicked her fingers and said it would be instantaneous, so don't worry.' The inquest heard she told doctors she did not want medication for her condition and was not judged to be a suicide risk. Mr Nigam said he began to accept there was nothing that could be done to help his daughter. He said: 'Nobody was willing to accept our version of events. What she said was given so much significance while what we said was ignored. 'I thought I might as well just let her go. I was waiting for something like this to happen. I literally felt like a passenger. 'I wish I had not subjected her to any of those doctors or anybody now. All I have done is added to her misery.' He added that every time he dropped his daughter off at a train station, he feared it would be the last time he saw her. He believes his daughter eventually took her life because she feared she would be put back on medication. The inquest heard Miss Nigam had suffered from a number of conditions in addition to depression, including acne, malnutrition, hair loss and itchy skin. She had achieved all A and A* grades at GCSE level, but was in and out of school and college as she battled her illness. The inquest continues.

Leonie Granger, 25, targeted playboy Mehmet Hassan, 56, after spotting him flashing a roll of \u00a350 notes at a casino in London's West End. The care assistant, from Gillingham, Kent, used her good looks to befriend the poker player, who showered her with gifts, cash and trips to fancy restaurants. Scroll down for video . Aspiring model Leonie Granger (left) has been jailed for 16 years at the Old Bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler Mehmet Hassan (right) who she lured at a casino . Granger (pictured with Mr Hassan at Palm Beach Casino in central London) took advantage of him being a 'soft target', the court heard.\u00a0Judge William Kennedy today described the attack as 'pitiless and wicked' But after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside. They tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings.\u00a0Afterwards, they left him with multiple broken bones, lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood. Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Granger was found guilty of Mr Hassan's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder. She was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by Judge William Kennedy today. Co-defendants Kyrron Jackson, 28, and Nicholas Chandler, 29, were\u00a0found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years. Sentencing, Judge William Kennedy described the attack as 'pitiless and wicked', adding: 'It was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion.' In mitigation, Orlando Pownall QC said Granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with Jackson and 'fell in with his desires'. Mr Pownall said she now 'deeply regretted' what had happened, adding: 'Her head was turned by Mr Jackson who she loved and to some extent by Mr Chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming.' But jailing her, the judge said she had been 'deceitful from the outset' and had 'lost her sense and compassion' when she got involved in the scheme. He added that she clearly cared more for Jackson than he cared for her. Granger, from Gillingham, Kent, used her good looks to befriend the poker player, who showered her with gifts, cash and trips to fancy restaurants. She wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter . Granger and Mr Hassan are pictured on CCTV going in to the Palm Beach Casino in central London together . All the defendants were convicted of robbing Mr Hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him. Jackson and Chandler, both of south east London, were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of Grosvenor Casinos, two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in January last year, and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison. The trial had heard how Mr Hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as Rachel, even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him. Granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two . After their first date, Granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that Hassan was 'flashy' and saying: 'This guy is a professional gambler. He has never worked a day in his life.' On the night of the murder, Mr Hassan had taken Granger to the top Mayfair restaurant Nobu before going on to the Palm Beach Casino nearby, where he gave her \u00a31,000 in cash to gamble with. Dressed in a strapless top, tight-fitting black trousers, high heels and a large gold necklace, Granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing Mr Hassan 'passionately' and she told the pair to 'get a room'. Later, he took her back to his Islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend Jackson and his friend Chandler, who were poised to strike outside. Using parcel tape, the two men tied up Mr Hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash. While Mr Hassan's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered, the killers were filmed on Granger's mobile phone throwing wads of \u00a350 notes around. They fled with \u00a33,000, his TV and mobile phone, but were caught after Granger's phone records were examined. Granger's co-defendants Kyrron Jackson, 28, (left) and Nicholas Chandler, 29, (right), both from south east London, have both been convicted of murdering Mr Hassan and are to be sentenced in due course . Granger (left) helped Kyrron Jackson (centre) and Nicholas Chandler (right) rob and kill gambler Mr Hassan . Police found Mr Hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm. His knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek. Investigators found he had suffered a 'vicious and sustained attack' \u2013 probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money. Granger's 'soft target' was known to have two favourite casinos in Mayfair - the Playboy Casino on Old Park Lane and the Palm Beach Casino in Berkeley Street. He sometimes won as much as \u00a315,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts, he would keep his winnings around his flat, even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave. The fact the divorced father 'enjoyed the company of women' made him particularly 'vulnerable to the unscrupulous', prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors. Chandler is pictured throwing around \u00a350 notes around which he stole from Mr Hassan after killing him . He said Mr Hassan's death was the 'culmination of the ruthless greed' of Jackson and Chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in South Kensington in January and February last year, but with limited success. The jury was shown CCTV film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of Granger and Mr Hassan together in the casino hours before the killing. They were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim's money around hours after the murder, with Jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants. Speaking after their convictions last week, Mr Hassan's family said his death will 'haunt them forever'. His daughter Stephanie Hassan added: 'Every day we miss him and we love him.'",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nAlmost a third of teachers have suffered online bullying at the hands of parents in the last year, a survey suggests. Families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers. Around 30 per cent of teachers said they had been the subject of parents\u2019 abusive internet posts. A study of 1,500 teachers found 30 per cent have suffered online abuse by parents - and that this type of bullying is on the rise accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year . And the poll found that bullying by parents is on the rise, accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year compared to just 27 per cent last year. The survey, by teachers\u2019 union NASUWT, reveals a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. One teacher said they had been sworn at by a parent online over a PE lesson, while a female dance teacher said she had been called a \u2018paedophile\u2019 for wanting to film a performance. Others said they had received insults from parents about their appearance and weight, with one told she was ugly and her \u2018husband could do better than her\u2019. Of those harassed online by parents, 15 per cent had threats made against them, compared to seven per cent in 2014. The poll  also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year . Around eight per cent saw allegations of inappropriate behaviour with students, six per cent saw videos or photos taken without consent and three per cent were told they had behaved inappropriately towards parents. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year \u2013 increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: \u2018It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.\u2019 He added: \u2018The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers\u2019 health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.\u2019 The survey found that many teachers had received racist, sexist and homophobic remarks online \u2013 with one teacher called a \u2018wog\u2019 by a pupil and others called \u2018lesbian\u2019 and \u2018slut\u2019. And teachers said that 60 per cent of the abusive comments online had been written by pupils. Over half of the pupils responsible for abuse were aged between 14 and 16, while 38 per cent were aged between 11 and 14, the teachers\u2019 poll found. One teacher received the comment \u2018I hope she gets cancer\u2019, while a heavily pregnant worker was sworn at, called \u2018fat whore\u2019 and \u2018ugly\u2019. Another said they had been harassed for seven months by pupils who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in their name. A number of teachers reported pupils had used their identity to set up bogus Facebook profiles and post sexually inappropriate messages. One man only found out months afterwards and feared it could be used to \u2018smear him\u2019 and destroy his career. Just under a third of bullied teachers did not report the incidents to their school or to police. Mrs Keates went on to say: \u2018While there has been some improvement in action taken on reported abuse, there are still too many cases where no appropriate action is taken and teachers are being left devastated, humiliated and traumatised.\u2019 The union called for the next government to require schools to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to online abuse and use all sanctions available to address any bullying of staff. Some of the most disturbing examples of online abuse from parents include: . A female attacked by parents for her appearance and the size of her nose. She was told she was \u2018ugly\u2019 and \u2018her husband could do better\u2019. Another was called \u2018rubbish\u2019, with a mother incorrectly claiming that she had \u2018tried to kill her daughter\u2019 by making her do PE without an inhaler. A parent posted comments saying that a female dance teacher was \u2018a paedophile\u2019 for videoing performances. A teacher was sworn at and told he was \u2018pathetic\u2019 for asking a pupil to replace equipment he had broken. Family members falsely accused a teacher of having sex with pupils \u2013 making him fear for his career.",

Kemery, told police that he rented the car in Florida and drove north to the Hamptons and discovered the car had bedbugs.

However, he then made the near fatal mistake of getting into the car and lighting his cigarette, thereby igniting the alchol and setting himself on fire. Bedbugs: Mr. Kemery had been reliably informed by a friend that the best way to kill bedbugs was to douse them in alcohol.

Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Jama said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" Jama said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack . In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe pictures show a caring sister helping her brother with his coat, giving him a kiss, and tenderly holding his hand as they play together. But while the scene looks idyllic, it is tinged with sadness, as Joel Wilkinson has a muscle wasting disease meaning he will eventually be left in a wheelchair and his life will be cut short. The three-year-old, from Hull, was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just six months ago after his parents, Emma, 33, and Chris, 36, noticed he was struggling to develop and learn to walk. They were left devastated when tests confirmed their son had the incurable condition and that is likely only to live to the age of 20. Now, they have decided to make his short life as full of joy as possible. Joel Wilkinson, five, was diagnosed with\u00a0Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy six months ago, meaning his muscles will slowly waste away. His sister Phoebe, five, adores him and cares for him as much as possible . Joel will eventually need a wheelchair and has a life expectancy of just 20. \u00a0Phoebe  plays only 'muscle friendly' games that won't tire her brother out - and refuses to play games at school unless Joel can join in . Phoebe makes sure her brother is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat (left), fetches his cereal in the morning and plays with him in the garden (right) Thankfully Joel's big sister, Phoebe, five, adores her brother and makes sure he is thoroughly looked after - she helps him put on his shoes, fasten up his coat and even helps fetch him his cereals in the morning. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'We were heart broken when we discovered that Joel had such an awful terminal disease. 'We told Phoebe as soon as Joel was diagnosed that he had a problem with his muscles and that they're weaker than normal. 'It was important she understood so they could play games that wouldn't tire him such as playing with toys and painting. 'We've told them both that the doctors are trying to find a medicine to help. 'She now only plays \"muscle friendly\" games that don't involve Joel running around and getting extremely tired. 'Phoebe loves her little brother so much and she even takes care of him when they are both at school as they share break times together. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. It usually only affects boys (around one in 3,500), although girls can carry the defective gene. Although not apparent at birth symptoms appear in early childhood. Boys with Duchenne's will have difficulty with walking, jumping and climbing stairs. The disorder is diagnosed via a blood test and muscle tissue sample. Sufferers are likely to need increasing help and treatments from the age of nine. Walking becomes difficult and a wheelchair is usually needed by the age of 12. As patients go through their teenage years they are more likely to suffer from complications such as chest infections. Most most people with Duchennes survive well into their 20s and sometimes longer. The eventual cause of death is usually a severe chest infection at the stage when lung function is already poor. 'She openly tells their friends that she won't join in with any games unless Joel can keep up too. 'It's such a relief knowing that she's keeping an eye on him when I'm not around.' Mr and Mrs Wilkinson found out their son Joel had Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy just before his third birthday last year. The condition affects around one in 3,500 and causes difficulties with movement, meaning a wheelchair is normally needed by the age of 12. Mrs Wilkinson said she hopes there will be a scientific breakthrough before that point. She said: 'His only hope is that researchers have a breakthrough in time to save him and the hundreds of other boys who have this terrible disease. 'Joel will lose the use of his legs first, leaving him wheelchair-bound, and then other muscles thereafter. Eventually, his heart and lungs will fail. At first Joel's parents thought he was a late developer but when at six months he couldn't sit and by two he couldn't walk they knew something was seriously wrong. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Results from the blood test in July said he had muscle dystrophy, but it wasn't until the end of September, after more tests, that we found out it was Duchenne.' The disease, which results in muscle degeneration, has already left Joel unable to get up the stairs or walk long distances. Mrs Wilkinson added: 'Joel struggles to stand up and despite only being three he looks like a little old man when he tries to get up. 'It's an awful illness but we are going to ensure that Joel has the best life and with Phoebe's help we know he'll enjoy every second. 'Phoebe will often clear away both of their toys so that her little brother doesn't get too tired. 'She will help him put on his shoes, fasten his coat and even helps him with his cereals in the morning. 'When I tell them both to tidy up their toys Phoebe will instantly stick up for him and say \"what about his weak muscles\". Emma Wilkinson, 33, and her husband Chris, 36, realised there was something wrong with their son when Joel wasn't developing properly. The family have now decided to make Joel's short life full of joy . As well as playing with her brother at home, Phoebe looks after Joel at school, spending break times with him . 'It's adorable but he's so spoilt.' Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy occurs mainly in boys and although it can be inherited it often occurs with no known family history of the condition. Mrs Wilkinson said this was the case for her and her husband, so they were shocked when Joel was diagnosed. She said: 'We have no family history of the condition so it has been such a shock for us to come to terms with but that's why we've set up the Joy for Joel appeal.' The family have set up at online fundraising website to ensure Joel he gets the specialist treatment he needs to make his life as comfortable as possible. 'We need funds to help Joel be as independent as possible when he grows up and so we can adapt our home,' Mrs Wilkinson explained. 'When he's older we will need a special hoist and a bedroom and wet room downstairs.' Until then, the family are focusing on creating as many memories as possible with Joel while he has some muscle function. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Thanks to Phoebe, Joel has a constant play mate and she helps him ensure he gets the most out of the time he has being able to move his muscles. 'There isn't any medication Joel can take that will slow down his muscle deterioration so we have to watch helplessly as he slowly becomes weaker. 'But we're trying to keep positive and with the help of Phoebe we are getting through it as a family.' There is no cure for Duchenne's, nor any medication that can slow \u00a0his muscle deterioration. But thanks to Phoebe, Joel  has a constant playmate . Often Phoebe will clear up Joel's toys after they have played together so he doesn't become to fatigued.\u00a0'It's adorable but he's so spoilt,' Mrs Wilkinson said . Mr Wilkinson, who works in IT development support at a logistics company, said: 'We cannot put into words the heartache and devastation Joel's diagnosis is causing us. 'Being unable to help, mend and protect your child is soul-destroying. 'The only thing we can do is bring joy to the time he has.' Families in a similar position can find support by contacting Muscular Dystrophy UK. Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the charity, said: 'Hearing that your child has a rare muscle-wasting condition can be a huge shock for parents. 'Families time and time again tell us about the importance of having a strong network in place. 'For many parents, family members and charities like Muscular Dystrophy UK, can play a major role in providing that much needed emotional support and practical help, throughout this journey. 'Many families have told us how they are struck by the sense of acceptance and resilience that a sibling can display as their brother or sister gradually gets weaker. 'Siblings can be very protective and supportive of each other, and will often find imaginative ways to play and have fun together despite mobility issues. 'This can be a huge source of comfort and reassurance for parents.' To donate visit: http://www.joyforjoel.co.uk .",

The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting. The dramatic incident recorded by a terrified onlooker took place in Olani village, in central India .",

A Melbourne penthouse apartment in the Australia 108 complex that boasts 360 degree views of the city has been sold for $25 million to a Chinese businessman . The Melbourne apartment, which is spread across the entire 100th floor of skyscraper Australia 108, is the most expensive single apartment sold in the country . The new owner, whose identity was not disclosed, will have 360 degree views over Melbourne's CBD, their own private grand foyer and glass elevator. The penthouse apartment was sold two months after being advertised as double the size of the average Australian home and boasting views that could never be built out. Construction has started on the building, which was designed by Fender Katsalidis Architects, and is due to be completed by 2019. Australia 108 will contain 1,105 luxury apartments, as well as retail tenancies, a multi-level carpark and communal facilities for residents including pools, gym, sauna, steam room and private theatre.

CBRE managing director of residential projects Andrew Leoncelli told Domain there was high interest in the penthouse apartment and three local buyers had expressed interest. 'The extraordinary sale of the Australia 108 penthouse sets a new benchmark for pricing, breaking all records ever set in Australia. It is by far the most opulent, landmark and exciting trophy apartment ever brought to market,' he said. There are two types of apartments for sale at the super skyscraper complex, including 161 of the Cloud Residences. These sit above the gold 'starburst' at levels 70 and 71, which\u00a0house luxury services accessible to residents. Beneath the 'starburst' are 944 Skyrise Residences. The apartment block has three infinity pools set against floor-to-ceiling glass to give swimmers a view of either the glittering city skyline or shimmering bay.

Doerr's novel had received rave reviews upon its release last spring. \"I must blame Anthony Doerr for lost sleep, because once I started reading his new novel, 'All the Light We Cannot See,' there was no putting it down,\" wrote William T. Vollmann in The New York Times Book Review. Doerr's work was also a finalist for the National Book Award. It's his second novel and fourth work of fiction, including two short story collections. 2015 Pulitzer Prize winners in journalism named . \"Between Riverside and Crazy,\" a play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, won the Pulitzer for drama. An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf***** with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off -- except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think. She has a good grip on her subject and uses a light touch when it is most needed.\" Other winners in arts and letters categories include \"Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People\" by Elizabeth A. Fenn (history); \"The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe\" by David I. Kertzer (biography/autobiography); \"Anthracite Fields\" by Julia Wolfe (music); and \"Digest\" by Gregory Pardlo (poetry). The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University and are considered some of the most prestigious honors in journalism and literature.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nAndy Murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow British tennis players who might be agitated about the imminent arrival of Aljaz Bedene into the home ranks: don\u2019t complain. Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world No 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene\u2019s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Aljaz Bedene is pictured at his British citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday morning . Andy Murray says British players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking . Bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in Hatfield . Last year, when Bedene stated he intended to try to make the switch, the then British No 3 Dan Evans expressed some doubts about its legitimacy, wondering why he would wish to do it. But Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. \u2018If he was 500 in the world they wouldn\u2019t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit,\u2019 said the 27-year-old Scot. \u2018And he\u2019s obviously the British No 2, comfortably. \u2018So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He\u2019s British now so they\u2019ve just got to deal with it. \u2018I would hope that all the guys who are below him now, like James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup ties then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. \u2018He\u2019s a good player but so are James and Kyle, and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he\u2019s on the tour every week, the other guys aren\u2019t quite there yet.\u2019 Murray admits Bedene's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week . James Ward (left) and Kyle Edmund should try to use Bedene as motivation to get better as a player . Bedene (right) with girlfriend Kimalie, who is a pop singer in her native land of Slovenia . For the first time, Murray, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene: \u2018He\u2019s a good player with a very good serve. He\u2019s a legitimate top-100 player, when he plays challengers he\u2019s there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main tour he wins matches, it\u2019s not like he turns up and always loses in the first round. \u2018He had a bad (wrist) injury last year but has recovered well. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings, although I don\u2019t know exactly how high he can go. I\u2019ve practised with him a couple of times, I haven\u2019t seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would imagine he\u2019s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while.\u2019 Bedene can individually represent any country he wants where he holds a passport. The Davis Cup is a greyer area as from January 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the Slovenian squad three times \u2014 but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process. It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give support to his case but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: \u2018To have another player in the men\u2019s top 100 is clearly a positive thing and so we very much welcome Aljaz\u2019s change in citizenship.\u2019 Murray says Bedene is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings . Murray gets pumped up on his way to victory over Kevin Anderson at the Miami Open . Murray proudly poses with a cake, saying 'It's an amazing feeling' after winning his 500th game . Switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and Evans\u2019s questions have some pertinence to them. There is a recent precedent, however. Two years ago Australian Brydan Klein switched to represent GB by virtue of his mother originally being from Manchester. He subsequently struggled but his form has picked up and he is now ranked 210 in the world to make himself the national No 5. Last year that would have guaranteed a Wimbledon wildcard worth, minimally, a staggering \u00a327,000. However, there is now no automatic recommendation for a Championships wildcard for Brits ranked inside the top 250. The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally popular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairness to him, he proved true to his word. The Great Britain Davis Cup team celebrate their victory against the USA in Glasgow last month .",

A dog walker used nail clippers to free a kidnapped woman who police say was held prisoner and sexually assaulted by a Canadian man for five days. The 27-year-old sex trade worker emerged from a home in Toronto, Canada, bound by handcuffs, badly bruised and naked from the waist down begging for help. Peter Hamilton heard her cries as he was passing by and desperately tried to free her from her restraints. She told him that her kidnapper was still inside, but had fallen asleep. Mr Hamilton wanted to call the police, but had left his cell phone at home, forcing him to take out the only item he had on him - the nail clippers. Police claim Rejean Hermel Perron held the alleged victim at gunpoint on March 31 when she refused to go inside. He is then said to have held the woman for five days,\u00a0subjecting her to sexual assaults including 'ritualistic actions' that officers said they were 'unfamiliar with'. Detectives believe there could be more victims who have yet to come forward. The 43-year-old is alleged to have met the woman, in the Sherbourne and Shuter Street area of the city before the pair returned to his home. The National Post\u00a0reports that she became 'uncomfortable' and made it clear she wanted to leave. But he then allegedly produced the weapon and restrained her with duct tape and handcuffs. Police say she was subjected to multiple sexual assaults. Perron was arrested on Monday and later charged with sexual assault with a weapon, kidnapping, forcible confinement and assault. Describing the dramatic escape, Mr Hamilton told the CBC\u00a0how he was walking his dog in the Dundas Street East and Jones Street area when he heard desperate pleas for help. Hero: Dog walker Peter Hamilton heard the woman's cries for help before he saw her come out of the house bound by restraints and naked from the waist down . Quick thinking: He wanted to call the police but left his cell phone at home, so had to use the only implement he had on him to free the woman - his nail clippers . He said a woman appeared on a veranda of a home but could not move further because of the restraints on her hands and feet. She warned him her kidnapper was still armed and inside the home. Mr Hamilton told CBC: 'My first thought was 'how do I get her out of here?' 'I knew this was a dangerous situation. I couldn't leave her, but I could not go back to my house to get my phone.' When a man emerged from the home, Mr Hamilton stood up ready for a confrontation. But the man then turned and fled, it is reported. Mr Hamilton added:\u00a0'This is where it could have taken a turn for the worse,' said Hamilton. 'He came out and he ran. He saw us and he just ran and that was a very good thing.' 'She was very emotionally distressed and she said, \"I'm sorry I have to put you through this.\" There was nothing to apologize for. 'It's just the right thing to do. We live in a society where sometimes people turn a blind eye to what's going on around them.' In part, he has thankful for having his dog, as he wouldn't have been walking through the neighborhood for any reason. He told the Toronto Star: Without having that dog, I wouldn't have taken a walk through the neighbourhood, and if he hadn't taken a walk, he wouldn't have encountered a shocking crime in progress, and wouldn't have had the opportunity to intervene and possibly save a woman's life. 'Whatever fate or destiny comes into it, the dog has as much of a part. 'The horror of what happened to her, of what she had gone through, hadn't really sunk into me yet. 'What sinks into you is the horror you're seeing right now, which is that there's a naked woman on the floor in handcuffs who needs help.' After he contacted police, Mr Hamilton said he spent the day with his wife and went for a hike out of town. 'That was good. It calmed everybody down,' he said. The woman was rushed to hospital after passers-by called emergency services and is said to be recovering. Crime scene: After Mr Hamilton helped free the woman, a man emerged from the house, so they ran. The alleged victim is now being treated in hospital .",

Nadal suffered his earliest exit in 12 years at the Barcelona Open last week with a third-round defeat by world No 29 Fabio Fognini and has admitted his confidence is lacking. World No 1 Novak Djokovic is 30-2 so far this season and became the first man to win the first three Masters titles of the year after his triumph in Monte Carlo. Roger Federer posted this picture on Twitter on Monday night as he gets set for the Istanbul Open . Federer hits a shot during a media event near the Bosphorus in Istanbul on Monday . Federer reaches to his right to play a forehand during the hit with a young Turkish tennis player . But Federer insists that arch-rival Nadal, who has won the title nine times and has only ever lost one match at Roland Garros, is still the man to beat. Federer said: 'At the French Open, Rafa for me is still the favourite alongside Djokovic who has been playing so well. 'Even though his (Nadal's) form is not as good as in previous years, I still believe when the French Open rolls around he is going to be very difficult to beat.' Federer, 33, looks to bounce back at the inaugural Istanbul Open this week after losing to flamboyant Frenchman Gael Monfils in the third round in Monte Carlo. The 17-time Grand Slam champion takes on Marsel Ilhan or Jarkko Nieminen in his opening match as he he looks to get settled on the clay after an extended run on hard courts. Federer said: 'It's about getting used to the sliding, deciding how aggressive I want to play. Rafael Nadal is a nine-time champion at Roland Garros and Federer still believes he is the man to beat . Federer speaks to the media during a press conference ahead of the Istanbul Open . Federer hits a ball into the sea as he takes part in the media event on the banks of the Bosphorus . 'I have been on hard courts for seven-eight months so it needs some adjustments. 'My game is going to get better and better as we move along.' '[The French Open] is clearly a big goal of mine. 'But to play well at the French Open I need confidence. I hope that I can pick that up in Istanbul.'",

Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a \"Most Wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's located in Kenya's North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\"  Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Adam said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" He said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Adam said. Five arrested in Kenya attack . Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as those who supported them. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe title race might be all but over but the fight for survival is only just beginning. At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety. Win on Saturday and they will be out of the relegation zone. For Nigel Pearson and his men, their season starts now. When you\u2019re facing relegation you are supposed to be dispirited and lacking in confidence. So how on earth have Leicester won three on the bounce? Only Arsenal (8) and Chelsea (4) can better that as a winning streak. Leicester players are full of confidence after three successive victories in the Premier League . It has been a superhuman effort and they have fought to get themselves in a position where they have something to play for. Leicester were bottom on Christmas Day but win at Burnley and they will give themselves a real chance of staying up \u2014 something only two sides have managed after being bottom at Christmas. It\u2019s not just Leicester, though. The other promoted clubs \u2014 QPR and Burnley \u2014 have shown fantastic spirit. I have been in relegation battles and seen teams with less fight in them than these three. QPR earned a fantastic win at West Brom, were unlucky to draw at Aston Villa and battled manfully against Chelsea. Burnley might be on a poor run but you know Sean Dyche\u2019s side will battle until the bitter end. So how does a manager create a positive attitude when things look so bad? What you can\u2019t afford to do is let players sit and study the fixtures and start looking at how many points they need. If they are too busy working out the permutations, they\u2019re not concentrating on their game. Leicester face a crunch clash with fellow relegation battlers Burnley on Saturday . If a player is not being pushed it\u2019s easy for them to shift responsibility and hope somebody else gets them over the line. The best thing to do is keep them busy. If you\u2019re working hard on the training ground looking at team shape, developing players and preparing for games, you are making much better use of your time. I\u2019ve been in that situation as a player and the worst thing you can do is to wrap them in cotton wool. There is a tendency to try to protect people in case things go wrong. Training eases up because of injury fears and managers try to keep their players fresh. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has managed to create a positive attitude in his squad . But that leaves you sitting around with your thoughts and that can be dangerous. There needs to be mental stimulation \u2014 you can\u2019t sit around and wallow in self-pity. At this stage of the season a week can be a long time between games. Pearson and his players will be absolutely buzzing in training and it\u2019s important to take that energy and intensity into games. It annoys me when managers say it\u2019s all about results. The only way to win is to make sure that your performance is right and that comes from hard work during the week. Pearson has worked hard to make sure Leicester\u2019s destiny is in their own hands. Their form has struck fear into other teams. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring in the 2-0 victory against Swansea . The three promoted sides look brave enough to go out and play, but Sunderland and Hull look paralysed by fear. Steve Bruce thinks Hull\u2019s home form will keep them up but a look at the fixtures shows it won\u2019t be that easy. Leicester, QPR and Burnley have all given their home fans reason to cheer with their efforts and the thrill of the chase means everything is applauded. Contrast that with the toxic feeling at the Stadium of Light. Leicester have taken a long time to wake up but they have rekindled the atmosphere they had when they beat Manchester United. And with four of their last six games at home, they need to keep that up. If they can, and the level of their performance continues to harness the positivity of that home crowd, don\u2019t bet against them making the great escape. Fans still believe that Leicester can still avoid the drop from the Premier League .",

Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days after her initial report to police saying she was groped by Weinstein during a 'business meeting' at his office in Manhattan. It has been claimed the delay was because the Italian model and her manager were working behind the scenes to try and land her a film role. But once the 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to pursue the criminal case, sources told the New York Post. See below for video . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan last Friday night . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . After filing her police report on Friday, March 27, Battilana was eventually interviewed by Manhattan DA prosecutors on Wednesday, April 1, at the NYPD Special Victims Squad's office in East Harlem. Sources told the New York Post her former lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, withdrew from the case as he was concerned Battilana did not appear to be a 'serious victim'. The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and even tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat. But her new lawyer, David Godosky, refuted the claims, saying: 'She immediately went to the police, immediately cooperating with the Special Victims Squad.' Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse yesterday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Weinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall. The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night. She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported. Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . The day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seat . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'",

Going up in West Virginia, Travis says he was surrounded by country music and knew he wanted to be a singer from about the age of six. Travis and Jamie team up to hit the high notes at least once a week during which time the duo can sing anything from George Jones, to Jason Aldean, to Brantley Gilbert. Uncle Jamie has lived with Travis for more than a decade since his uncle's parents died. Ambition: Travis says he had long dreamed of becoming a country singer and is now receiving offers from Nasville . Travis says he is now finding that because of the popularity of the video, he has fans all over the country and has even taken calls from Nashville record labels. He vows that if all goes well he will be auditioning for The Voice for the 2016 season. He is currently working on a CD that consists of 12 original songs and hopes to release his music soon. The budding performer says he also hopes to take a trip to Tennessee and visit Music City USA before long to hopefully secure a record deal his family can be proud of.",

Also making a very impressive showing are the Texas Rangers and Atlanta Braves, who have fans across a wide area in the South. Then there are a few teams who don't get as much love - like the New York Mets. Scroll down for video . A new Facebook graph reveals the favorite baseball teams in the country by sorting through people's likes and breaking down winners by county . The New York Yankees (left) and Boston Red Sox (right) come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite . The Mets are not the favorite team in one county in the country, with fans in their area seeming to all go for the Yankees. Same goes for the Oakland Athletics. The Toronto Blue Jays can also claim almost all of Canada, though the Yankees and Red Sox are also favorites in some areas. The graph, created by Facebook, uses profile likes and then breaks the individuals down by country to determine a winner. And with the exception of those aforementioned Yankees, Red Sox and recent World Series champs San Francisco Giants, who get some love in Hawaii, most teams only really get support near their home field.",

Now you can, thanks to a new app that calculates a slimmer version of yourself - without having to do any exercise. \u2018Visualize You\u2019 processes an image of you to reveal what you'd look like if you were thinner - and perhaps inspire you to achieve your weight loss goal. Visual Health Studios in Colorado has developed a weight loss app called Visualize You. It calculates what you would look like if you lost a specified amount weight. Shown on the left is TV star James Corden at his current weight, 210lbs (95kg), and on the right he is seen after digitally losing 60lbs (27kg) A picture of Bridesmaids actress Melissa McCarthy at an event in February is shown on the left, and on the right the star is seen after digitally losing 50lbs (23lbs) Users are shown an original and a slimmer version, with a slider, so they can compare how they would look before and after losing weight. The app, which costs \u00a31.61 ($2.40) on\u00a0Android and \u00a31.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version,\u00a0has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps which stretch or pinch images. The app has been developed with the Wellness Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Centre, and UnitedHealthcare. Actor Jonah Hill, pictured in June 2014, is seen on the left at his normal weight, and on the right he is shown with a digital weight loss of 60lbs (27lbs) It asks you to enter your current height and weight and your target weight, giving you flexibility over how ambitious you want to be. Weight loss specialist Dr Charlie Seltzer told Yahoo Health: \u2018Visual cues are very helpful for a lot of people. \u2018I will often recommend that people put up pictures of what they want to look like or what they used to look like, provided the body image is healthy. \u2018l\u2019d hate for someone to put [their photo] in and see themselves not the way they are going to look, and get discouraged and disgruntled that they\u2019re not changing how they\u2019re supposed to. \u2018But my first thought upon hearing about this app, was: \"It sounds like a really good idea.\"' Charlie Lankston (lost 20lbs/9kg) Charlie Lankston is seen here before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 20lbs (9kg) 'At first, I thought it was great. The \"after\" picture looks pretty realistic, which I wasn\u2019t actually expecting, and it was amazing to see what I could potentially look like with a few more trips to the gym! 'However, after thinking about it a bit more, I started feeling a slightly ashamed about the size of my actual face. 'Realistically, losing 20lbs is actually a pretty tough task, and the likelihood that I\u2019ll be able to achieve it - and attain my \"skinny face\" - any time soon is pretty \"slim\" which doesn\u2019t make me feel too great. 'Looks like it\u2019s time to hit the treadmill\u2026' Erica Tempesta (lost 38lbs/17kg) Erica Tempesta is seen here before before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 38lbs/17kg . 'It was cool to see such a dramatic difference, but I feel as though the app just changed the shape of my face, which isn\u2019t necessarily how I would look nearly 40lbs lighter. 'My face has always been oval, regardless of my size. The app just made my face look longer as if my cheeks were sucked in. 'I chose a somewhat unrealistic target weight, but it was the size I had been in high school, so based on past pictures, I already had an idea of what my face should have looked like with less weight. 'I personally didn\u2019t think the app gave a realistic rendering of weight loss.' The app allows you to take or upload a photo. You then need to enter your current height and weight, and then also enter your target weight. It will then enable you to 'scroll' through various weights on your way to your target, to see what you would look like . The app, which costs \u00a31.61 ($2.40) on Android and \u00a31.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps . Visualize You is effectively a reverse version of the popular app \u2018Fat Booth\u2019 in which users were able to see what they looked like if they were overweight. Fat Booth was launched in 2010 and has been downloaded 35,000,000 times, earning its creators an estimated \u00a316 million ($24 million). Opticians and fashion retailers have made use of similar technology to let users virtually try on glasses on their websites. Dr Michael Roizen, Chairman of Wellness at the Cleveland Clinic, said: \u2018Visualize You is a major step forward in helping people approach weight loss in a more informed, educated and fun manner.\u2019 Dr Holly Wyatt, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center added: \u2018The app offers individuals a clear-cut end goal for weight loss and provides [users] with an important tool to activate and achieve a successful programme.\u2019 Visualize You was released earlier this month and there are free and paid versions of the app which are available for iPhone and Android.",

The Cherries take on Sheffield Wednesday at the Goldsands Stadium on Saturday followed by the visit of Bolton nine days later and then a last-day trip to Charlton. The four-horse race for automatic promotion - second-placed Norwich face fourth-placed Middlesbrough on Friday night - is expected to go down to the wire with just two points separating those in contention. Eddie Howe and his Bournemouth players applaud travelling fans after victory against Reading . Howe has called on supporters to inspire the Cherries to win promotion from the Championship . 'The pleasing thing from our perspective regarding our home form is that it's improved as the season has gone on,' Howe told the club's official website. 'We have become more consistent, more adept at dealing with the different problems that we face and how teams set up against us, so we are in a good place at home. 'Hopefully the crowd can inspire us because we are going to need them more than ever. 'In these two games I'm sure there will be moments where we are either under pressure or need a lift and that's when hopefully they can do their bit for us.' Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic refuses to look beyond Saturday's home game against Birmingham as his third-placed side bid to climb back into the top two. Slavisa Jokanovic is not looking beyond Birmingham as Watford chase automatic promotion . 'There are three games more,' Jokanovic told his club's official website. 'We must continue, we must be ready. 'We know there is the chance of three more games after this, but we are not thinking of this. 'Only Birmingham City and three points on Saturday. That is the focus. We cannot talk about taking nine points because this is not what is in front of us.' Steve McClaren's Derby must improve on their recent away form at Huddersfield if they are to secure a play-off finish. The Rams, who have not won at Huddersfield since Boxing Day 1995, have won only one of their last seven games on the road, while Chris Powell's Terriers are unbeaten in their last four matches. Ipswich, Brentford and Wolves make up the four teams battling it out for the last two play-off places. Mick McCarthy will take\u00a0Luke Chambers (above) to his former club Wolves at the weekend . Mick McCarthy takes his Tractor Boys to Molineux for a potential humdinger against former club Wolves, while Brentford face Bolton at Griffin Park. Wigan will be relegated for the second time in three seasons if they fail to beat Brighton at home. Relegation rivals Millwall will look to build on Tuesday night's home win against Wigan with victory at Cardiff.

Among them, the family of eight-year-old Martin Richard, the youngest victim to lose his life in the April 15, 2013 attack, headed to Boylston Street to help officials unveil\u00a0commemorative banners. Four orange signs each bearing a white heart and the word 'Boston' were placed at the site.\u00a0They were mounted on poles wrapped in blue and yellow flowers, the marathon's colors, to mark the tragedy that took three lives and left more than 260 others injured. Martin's older brother Henry and younger sister Jane, who lost a leg in the explosion, helped unwrap one of the flags on the street as bagpipes played during the low-key ceremony. Scroll down for video . Somber: The Martin family, whose son Richard was killed in the Boston bombings, walk down Boylston Street with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, left, ahead of a ceremony to mark two years since the tragedy . Emotional: Jane, who lost a leg in the blast, shares a smile with her father while her mother wipes away a tear . Ceremony: Jane and Henry Martin remove a drape covering a memorial banner to honor the victims. In total, four large orange banners were unveiled near the explosion sites on Tuesday morning . Memories: The family takes a moment to reflect at the scene as a ceremony to mark the anniversary begins . The family of Krystle Campbell, who also died in the attacks, helped unwrap another banner with the help of Governor Charlie Baker. Also at the ceremony was Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the bombings. His ashen face was captured in a now-iconic photograph as he was wheeled away by strangers. One of those strangers, Carlos Arredondo, is now a close friend. Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' was also at the site on Tuesday morning to greet Bauman as he walked on prosthetic limbs. 'We're here to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives,' Bauman told WFXT-TV. They were joined by city officials including\u00a0Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker. At 2.49pm, a moment of silence was held to mark the moment the first of two bombs exploded near the finish line two years ago, while church bells sounded throughout the city. Well-wishers visited the site of the explosions throughout Tuesday to pay tribute to the young people who had lost their lives, and stopped to pay their respects at a memorial bearing their names. Mayor Walsh has declared April 15 'One Boston Day,' on which Bostonians are encouraged to perform random acts of kindness and generosity. Always remembered: Jane Martin sits on a new bench with the words 'Keep Running Boston' and 'Boston Strong' written across it outside the fire station on Boylston Street . Fitting right in: Jane tries on a firefighter's helmet during a visit to the Boylston Street fire station .

Thankful:\u00a0Denise Richard, who was hit in the head by shrapnel in the bombings, looks at banners signed by members of the public after the attack and now hanging at a fire station on Boylston Street . 'April 15 is a date that has come to stand for our city's deepest values,' he said as he announced the new tradition. 'In many respects, those most affected by the events of two years ago have shown us all the way back - with their courage, grace and determination,' Governor Baker said in a statement released after the ceremony. 'They honor the past, remember and treasure loved ones lost and injured, and look forward to a better future. We should strive to do the same.' Another victim who lost a leg in the bombings, Rebekah Gregory, took to Facebook on Tuesday morning to describe her disbelief that two years had already passed. She was at the marathon with her young son, Noah, and was less than 10 feet from where the first bomb exploded. She needed 17 surgeries and eventually had her left leg amputated last year. Last month, she testified against the surviving bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, in his trial.

Memorial: The new banners show white hearts with the word 'Boston' inside. They have been placed at the top of lampposts, which have been decorated by flowers in blue and yellow - the marathon's colors . 'It is extremely emotional to look back on the last two years of my life,' she wrote. 'To remember what it felt like to be bleeding out on the pavement, wondering if I would ever see my child's smile again... 'It's been a long road. Some days, I'm not quite sure how I have made it out of the bed. And if I'm being really honest, a few times I haven't. 'But no matter what, there is one thing that I always keep in mind. I am BLESSED. And no matter how hard someone tries, they will never be able to take that away from me.' She plans to run the last three miles of the marathon next Monday. She also visited the site last year, but was pushed in a wheelchair as she struggled with issues with her leg. 'This time I won't be laying on the ground in pieces, or having to be assisted because I can't do things on my own,' she wrote. Support:\u00a0A man wearing a shirt reading 'Boston Strong' and 'Survivor' walks near the ceremony on Tuesday . Respects: A passerby wearing a t-shirt honoring Martin pauses near one of the two explosion sites . Reflection: People stop by the memorial at the scene of the first explosion on the marathon route . Heartbreaking: A group of women gather near the site during the moment of silence on Tuesday afternoon . Powerful: A bunch of yellow and blue flowers lay at the scene of the first blast in Boston on Tuesday . 'This time...the only thing hitting the ground will be my running shoe, as I show myself and the rest of the world that I am back, stronger than ever....and there is NO stopping me now.' Three people were killed and more than 260 others were wounded in the April 15, 2013 attacks and the two bombers were cornered days later, after they shot dead an MIT police officer. One of the bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during a shootout with police in Watertown. The surviving bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was last week convicted of 30 counts during his federal trial. The jury is now deciding whether he should receive the death penalty but they have taken a break until next Tuesday. This year's marathon will be held next Monday.

Three other guards - Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard - were each sentenced to 30 years and one day in prison for charges that included manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and using firearms while committing a felony. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth announced the sentences after a day-long hearing at which defense lawyers had argued for leniency, and prosecutors asked that those sentences - the minimums mandatory under the law - be made even harsher. Scroll down for video . FILE - In these various file photos, Blackwater guards, from left, Dustin Heard, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Nicholas Slatten. A years-long legal fight over a deadly mass shooting of civilians in an Iraq war zone reaches its reckoning point, when four former Blackwater security guards are sentenced for the rampage. Three of the guards, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty and Paul Slough, face mandatory decades-long sentences because of firearms convictions. A fourth, Nicholas Slatten, faces a penalty of life in prison after being found guilty of first-degree murder. (AP Photo/File) Sentencing: Former Blackwater guard Nicholas Slatten (bottom right) was convicted of first degree murder and on Monday be sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 2007 Nisour Square slaughter that left 14 dead and dozens more maimed and injured.\u00a0Dustin Heard, Paul Slough and Evan Liberty (clockwise from top left) were received the 30-year minimum sentences plus one day for their multiple manslaughter convictions . U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth on Monday rejected a defense motion to impose lesser sentences on the four, as well as a motion by prosecutors to increase the penalties. Lamberth deferred formally imposing the sentences while hearing arguments from both sides on the sentencing. Defense lawyers argued for mercy but prosecutors said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility. All four were convicted in October for their involvement in the killings that caused an international uproar in Nisoor Square, a crowded traffic circle in downtown Baghdad. The legal fight over the killings has spanned years. Prosecutors have described the shooting as an unprovoked ambush of civilians, though defense lawyers countered that the men were targeted with gunfire, and shot back in self-defense. Dozens of Iraqi witnesses to the bloody September day in Baghdad volunteered to travel to Washington to testify against the former guards, the New York Times reported. They described to jurors a scene of absolute horror, one that came as if out of the clear blue. They said they took cover after hearing machine-gun fire start ring after four American armored vehicles rolled into busy Nisour Square. A traffic officer who was on the scene described watching a woman cradle her dead son in her arms before she, too, was murdered by Blackwater guards. Mandatory minimums: A man caring a poster that reads 'approximate locations of victims around Nisoor Square' enters the E.

Former co-workers: Former Blackwater security guards stand in line to enter the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse in Washington in support of the men awaiting sentencing . \u2018There was a lady. She was screaming and weeping about her son and asking for help,\u2019 Sarhan Deab Abdul Moniem said through an interpreter. \u2018I asked her to open up the door so I could help her. But she was paying attention only to her son.\u2019 Majed Salman Abdel Kareem al-Gharbawi, 55, described being shot in the gut and slumping to the ground alongside another wounded man. \u2018He was screaming and praying to god, for Allah to save him from this calamity,\u2019 Gharbawi testified. \u2018So I told him, let\u2019s do that together.\u2019 Gharbawi stayed down as the other man decided to make a run for it\u2014a decision that cost the man his life. \u2018His body was shaking violently as the bullets were piercing him and hitting the sidewalk,\u2019 Gharbawi said. According to the Times, the Blackwater guards continued shooting into the man\u2019s body well after he was clearly dead. The defense argued for mercy Monday by saying that decades-long sentences would be unconstitutionally harsh punishments for men who operated in a stressful, war-torn environment, and who have proud military careers and close family ties. The firearms convictions alone carry mandatory minimum sentences of 30 years in prison. The government sought sentences far beyond that, partly because it said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility. Bloodbath: an Iraqi woman peeps inside the blood stained car of two women allegedly shot dead by private security guards in central Baghdad. Dozens of Iraqi witnesses would later volunteer to testify about the atrocities they saw that day . Murdered: A picture shows the blood stained and bullet riddled car of two women allegedly shot dead by Blackwater guards. One witness would later describe watching a woman cradle her dead, bullet-riddled son before she was murdered at his side . Unimaginable: Hair is seen on the bullet riddled and blood stained windshield of a car of two women shot dead. One witness said he watched a man bolt for his life only to be riddled with bullets before guards continued to fire at his clearly dead body . The sentencing is unlikely to bring an end to the legal wrangling, which began even before the guards were first charged in 2008. A judge later dismissed the case before trial, but a federal appeals court revived it and the guards were indicted again in October 2013. Even before the trial began, defense lawyers had identified multiple issues as likely forming the basis of an appeal, including whether there was proper legal jurisdiction to charge them in the first place. The statute under which they were charged, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, covers the overseas crimes of Defense Department civilian employees, military contractors and others who are supporting the American war mission. But defense lawyers note that the Blackwater defendants worked as State Department contractors and were in Iraq to provide diplomatic, not military, services. The legal fighting continued in the days leading up to sentencing, too, with defense lawyers seeking Friday to postpone the hearing after receiving new information \u2014 a victim impact statement from a trial witness \u2014 that they said was favorable to the defense. But Lamberth denied the request, saying there was no need to delay the sentencing. Wartorn: The defense argued for mercy Monday by saying that decades-long sentences would be unconstitutionally harsh punishments for men who operated in a stressful, war-torn environment .

The 39-year-old was on the ninth hole when he found himself 470 yards away from the pin with the ball nestled in pine straws. However when he followed through, the four-time champion at Augusta slammed the club into a root, causing him to wince and grab his hand in agony. It forced the joint out of place, but Woods shunned medical attention and simply pushed it back in himself. Tiger Woods looks in agony after his club came into contact with a tree root on the ninth hole at Augusta. He later revealed his wrist bone had 'popped out' of place . The 39-year-old is clearly in agony as he is forced to drop his club on the follow through . He then grabs his wrist and winces. After finishing his round he revealed that his wrist bone had popped out - so he was forced to put it back in . His reaction prompted concerns he may have suffered another injury setback. However he managed to shake off the scare and finish his round. Woods, playing in his 20th Masters tournament, ended up at 5-under-par on 283, tied for 17th. 'It hurts; it definitely hurts,' Woods said. 'I didn't know there was a tree root there. I drilled the club straight into it. It didn't move, but my body kept moving. 'There's a little joint that popped out, and I was able to somehow put it back in, which didn't feel very good. 'At least I got it back in; I could move my hand again. It's sore. I'm not going to be lifting any weights for a while.' He also admitted that he may not return to the course for a while. Despite finishing\u00a013 strokes behind 21-year-old winner Jordan Spieth, this was Woods' best finish in a tournament in over a year. Spieth became the youngest winner since Woods when he was given the coveted green jacket on Sunday. After his final putt he went an embraced his tearful childhood sweetheart Annie Verret. The Texan native, whose life-long dream has been to win the Masters, was undoubtedly being watched on television at home by his youngest sibling, Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Ellie has helped to keep Spieth grounded, according to their mother. Speaking after his win, Spieth said: 'It was very nerve-wracking today. I didn't sleep all last night. Just got out here and got in a little rhythm. With two major champions right behind, I couldn't let up. It was the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It was remarkable. He added: 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green there, and knew it was going to be a done deal. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit.' Spieth's victory comes a year after he lost a bid to become the youngest player to win the Masters. This year, he did not let anyone get closer to him than three shots following his record start. He closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set another record. The four-time Masters champion managed to shake off the injury to finish the competition at 5-under-par . 21-year-old Jordan Spieth (centre) celebrates his first Masters victory with his girlfriend Annie Verret on Sunday . Spieth led from start to finish at Augusta, the first time that feat has been achieved in 39 years .

A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media,\u00a0Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but\u00a0has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say. Confession: Vera Maresova (right) was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation . Sick: All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Vera Maresova (pictured covering her house outside court) thought their deaths would be attributed to natural causes . Location: Vera Maresova killed five women and one man over a four-year period at this hospital in Rumburk - a small town in the north of the Czech Republic . Prosecutor Frantisek Stibor said: 'She is not insane and knew exactly what she was doing. Therefore she is fit to stand trial. 'She used her knowledge of medicine to cause malfunctions in heart rhythms which led to heart failure and death.' The first murder was in January 2010 and was followed by another at the end of 2011. In April 2012 she killed her third victim and three more between February and June 2014. Having confessed to the crime, 50-year-old Maresova now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life in prison.",

Ten per cent are even more relaxed about treasured photos, letters and mementos \u2013 leaving them lying around in piles of paperwork. A third of adults shun the storage possibilities of the internet and still keep their most important papers in a shoebox,the poll by online file-sharing service Lifetile found . From a marriage certificate to deeds to a house, only six per cent keep a back-up copy of vital paperwork online, while just 13 per cent bother to scan it to a computer, the poll by online file-sharing service Lifetile found. The survey of more than 2,000 Britons found almost half (45 per cent) rely on a safe or filing cabinet to store documents, from personal to official ones. While 32 per cent keep their possessions in a shoebox, the box itself is then filed away to a loft, cupboard or garage. The contents can include love letters and old photos before the age of digital cameras to a will or deeds to property, for instance, the children's old school reports and mementos. The survey also found 10 per cent of Brits ignore all the other available options and simply keep physical documents stacked in piles at various places around the home. An ultra cautious 4 per cent have safety deposit boxes, said the survey. Lifetile is a service offering an online site to keep private documents, photos and other memories to build up a family history to share with children and others online. It allows users to import digital photos, social media updates and entries and uploaded paperwork. Men are almost twice as likely women to keep such documents either online or on a computer, and younger adults more likely than older ones to do so, the research showed. Just 13 per cent bother to scan it to a computer, while\u00a0almost half (45 per cent) rely on a safe or filing cabinet to store documents . Founder Richard Grant said: 'The old shoebox represents a comforting place for people to keep their important documents and treasured memories. 'They can return time and again to look at photos of their children growing up, love letters, marriage certificates and much more. 'It's the story of your life in its simplest form. But the internet has opened up the possibility of immortalising our life story, by making it digital.' It is harder to lose documents and memories kept online, easier to share them with others and easier to find them in a hurry than if they were stored out of the way at home. Grant added: 'We spend so much of our life online, using the web to learn, shop and socialise and yet when it comes to the big life events and our important documents, all of which define us, we often choose to keep them tucked away for a rainy day.'",

Alongside the screengrab, Mings wrote: 'This is why I do it, this makes worth it [sic]' His apparent act of generosity drew over 2,000 'likes' and lots of praise from his followers, with many saying he was a role model that children should look up to. An Ipswich spokesman said the post was 'a private matter between Tyrone and his mum.' It is not the first time that Mings has acted out of the kindness of his heart. Left-back Mings has been a key player in Ipswich Town's push for promotion this season . Mings has been linked with a move to Premier League side Arsenal following impressive performances . In March 2013, he gave Tris Monk two tickets for an Ipswich game after the fan tweeted that he was 'skint'. The father-of-two from Haverhill was saving for a new house and couldn't afford to go to the match. And in July 2014, Mings bought new replica shirts for two supporters after his squad number changed from 15 to 3 after they had already purchased them. Mings arrived at Portman Road in 2013 from non-league Chippenham Town and has developed to become an integral part of an Ipswich side that is pushing for the Championship play-offs this season. In January, he was linked with a move to Premier League giants Arsenal.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nA father who is feared to have fled to Syria with his partner and four young children was a member of a banned extremist group, it was reported last night. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, their daughter Zoha, seven, and their three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one, were all caught on camera on a cross-Channel ferry. They left their home in Slough, Berkshire, without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which is out of character, police said. Scroll down for video . Detectives have released CCTV footage of   Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children, who have been reported missing from Britain, at a busy ferry port as they apparently head to Syria . Police say Mr Malik (pictured with one of his young children) had told his family he wanted to 'go and live in a Muslim country' and the family left without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to relatives, it is claimed . Members of Mr Malik's family tonight said they had been left 'completely devastated' and issued a desperate plea for the six to return home. In a statement, they said: 'We are totally distraught, upset and in shock' Police have warned that the Muslim family, who were last seen in Slough, Berkshire on April 7, may be heading to Syria. They are pictured at Dover port before catching a ferry to Calais, France on April 8 . The family, from Slough in Berkshire, are believed to have boarded the Dover to Calais ferry just after midnight on April 8 before travelling south through Europe including to Budapest in Hungary on April 12 . Protest: Malik, seen holding the 'hands off Muslims!' sign, outside Regents Park Mosque last year - next to him is Abu Rumaysah who jumped bail to flee to Syria . But radical preacher Anjem Choudary said yesterday Malik was a member of the banned group Al-Muhajiroun and a 'champion for sharia' who regularly attended the group's demonstrations. Neighbours said the family were known to police and had been questioned on suspicion of terrorist involvement four years ago. Uniformed police waited for the family for three days before talking to them, they said. There will now be questions for police after they failed to stop a suspected extremist from slipping out of the country with his family. Choudary said Malik remained 'very influential in the community' after Al-Muhajiroun was banned five years ago. 'Back in the day he was a member until the group was banned. He was still part of our demonstrations and lectures but I hadn't seen him for a few months,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'Asif is a very good friend of mine. I haven't seen him for a while but from what I gather in the reports he and his family have left the country.' He added: 'He is a very studious man, a very good Muslim character. He was always a champion for sharia and is very influential in the community.' Choudary also criticised the Government for trying to restrict British Muslims from travelling to Syria. 'I think they want to live under sharia and escape the oppressive life they have in this country and under this government,' he added. Asif Malik (left), 31, and his partner Sara Kiran (right), 29, were reported missing from Slough, Berkshire, after their childrenl failed to show up to school and their grandmother became worried about their whereabouts . Zoha Malik (left), seven, and Essa Malik (right), four, are among the family's four children who are missing . The family were last seen on Tuesday, April 7, and were captured on CCTV boarding a ferry from Dover to Calais on Wednesday, April 8. They are believed to have travelled south through Europe by train and were seen in Budapest on Sunday, April 12, before making their way to Turkey. Relatives reported them missing to police on Thursday and officers are concerned they may be seeking to travel to Syria. Last night, Malik's family said they were 'completely devastated' by the family's sudden decision to leave Britain. 'All we wish for is your safe return and especially the return of the children. We are not angry with you, we are just heartbroken,' they said in an appeal to him. Zakariya Malik (left), two, and\u00a0Yhaya Malik (right), one, were last seen with their family in Berkshire on April 7 . Mr Malik and Miss Kiran's last known address in Slough was in this block of flats (pictured on the left, above) Neighbours said today that police had broken down the door on Thursday night to enter the family's home . Thames Valley Police's Acting Deputy Chief Constable, John Campbell, said it was a 'real concern' they had reached Syria. 'I'm not suggesting for one moment that they are intending to join Islamic State,' he said. 'At the same time we know that [relatives] have voiced some concerns about the family's intentions. There's been a suggestion that [Malik] in the past has said that he would like to live in a Muslim state.' Acting deputy chief constable John Campbell (pictured at a press conference in Kidlington today) said Thames Valley Police is 'extremely concerned for the safety of this family, especially the four young children' The alarm was raised when some of the children failed to attend Claycots Primary School in Slough . Yesterday, the family's next-door neighbour said they had been in trouble with the police four years ago. He added: 'People were saying that they were extremists and that police were listening in on their phone calls. I think they were under surveillance. 'The police sat in the stairwell for three days waiting for them. 'It's such a shame. Those kids are now in danger because of what their parents believe in.'",

A policeman convicted of misconduct in a public office after having sex with women he met on duty was today labelled \u2018a disgrace\u2019 to the force. Adam Rushton took advantage of being a beat officer in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, to have sex with women, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The 37-year-old officer was found guilty of five counts of misconduct and another of breaching data protection rules by obtaining personal data. Rushton, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, denied ten counts of misconduct and two of breaching data protection laws while employed by police. He was acquitted on the remaining counts. Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 who had \u2018brought shame on himself, his colleagues\u2019 and the force. Giving evidence, Rushton, who has been with the force for ten years, conceded some of his actions were \u2018not very professional\u2019 but claimed it did not amount to criminal misbehaviour. During the trial, he said he never expected to end up in the dock after going to one woman's home and having oral sex. \u2018It's not very professional, I fully accept that, and that it's wrong,\u2019 Rushton told jurors. \u2018But no way whatsoever did I think I'd be standing here.\u2019 He was convicted over that offence, and of making a social visit to another victim, while on the clock. Rushton was also convicted of having sex with a different woman at her house. He was found guilty on two counts relating to another woman, whom he met outside work, on one occasion having sex with her while on another exchanging \u2018playful and flirty\u2019 text messages before going to her home. Beat officer: Rushton has been with Staffordshire Police (whose headquarters are pictured) for ten years . His conviction for breaching data rules was in relation to looking up information relating to a fifth victim. The offences all happened between 2008 and 2012. When first interviewed over the allegations in April 2013, he denied sleeping with all but one of the women, however later accepted he had sex with several others. However, he denied his actions were criminal misconduct. Rushton had an impressive professional record as a neighbourhood policing officer, with many letters of praise from senior officers. But Crown Prosecutor Duncan Bould said the constable's duties brought him into contact with \u2018vulnerable and frightened females, often in extreme circumstances\u2019 and he had \u2018sought to take advantage of those situations to have sexual activity of some kind with them\u2019. Criticism:\u00a0Staffordshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker (pictured) called Rushton \u2018a disgrace to the police service\u2019 after the verdicts . None of the women made any complaints to police about Rushton. He was conditionally bailed after the verdicts were read out and will be sentenced at the crown court on May 1. After the hearing, Mr Baker apologised to the police officer's victims on behalf of the force. He said: \u2018This was an astonishing breach of trust by an individual officer and he has badly let down vulnerable victims and their families. The public must be able to trust their police officers, and on this occasion they have been let down. \u2018We made the decision that Rushton should be prosecuted as a police officer, and hope this sends out a very strong message - no matter who you are, and what position you hold, if you commit crime you will be dealt with firmly and robustly.\u2019 He added that after the allegations came to light in 2013, the matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which carried out an investigation. Mr Baker said that, as a result, \u2018robust processes\u2019 were now in place to prevent such incidents happening. IPCC commissioner Kathryn Stone said Rushton had abused a position of trust and used his job \u2018in a calculated manner to satisfy his own sexual desires\u2019. Ms Stone added: \u2018The IPCC has previously expressed concern at the number of cases across England and Wales where officers have targeted vulnerable women for sex. 'And I hope that today's outcome reinforces a message that corrupt officers will be discovered and brought before the courts where appropriate.\u2019",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nIf there's someone who isn't scared to show her colourful side in these times of taupe and elephant breathe, it is celebrated interior designer Abigail Ahern. Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I\u2019ve ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette \u2013 silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys \u2013 it\u2019s what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour',\u00a0come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don\u2019t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot\u2019s Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room \u2013 say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to\u00a0communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you\u2019ll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You\u2019ll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo \u2013 all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery \u2013 you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don\u2019t neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you\u2019ve made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

But according to his\u00a0trainer, former professional boxer Terry Claybon, it took a huge amount of work to get the 34-year-old actor ripped for the shoot, including six months of training before filming even started. He also worked out for an incredible six hours per day, including 2,000 sit ups, 1,000 each morning and the same at night. Of course, Jake had to work even harder to get in shape because he had just  dropped approximately 30lbs to play freelance crime reporter Lou, who stumbles upon the dangerous underworld of Los Angeles in Nightcrawler. Scroll down for video . Blood, sweat and tears: According to his trainer, it took a huge amount of work to get Jake Gyllenhaal ripped for Southpaw, including six months of training before filming started, 2,000 sit ups and six hours of training each day . Much thinner: The 34-year-old lost 30 pounds for 2014 thriller Nightcrawler and had \u00a0to put that weight \u00a0back on plus 15lbs of muscle . He not only returned to his normal weight - but he then put on another 15 pounds of pure muscle to play the desperate fighter Billy Hope. His trainer Claybon told Yahoo: 'Gradually we built up, day-by-day, to 2,000. It takes time to do that', and revealed that his exercise regime included, 'three hours of boxing in the morning and three hours of strengthening, conditioning, and cardio at night.' Speaking about his weight loss for Nightcrawler, Jake told Us Weekly: 'I knew that [Lou] was literally and figuratively hungry, [so I got into the] mode where I was always a bit hungry. Beaten: The trailer shows a muscular Gyllenhaal bloodied and bruised by an opponent in the boxing ring . Bulking up: Jake poses here with his trainers, including former boxer Terry Claybon (second from right), who was responsible for whipping the once-scrawny actor into shape . Gyllenhaal also attended several boxing matches to watch how real fighters move in the ring . 'It's not different than getting into character for anything. It's more about believing where you are and being present where you are. Who's to say what the process is? I have a strange one \u2026 but I love what I do.' Claybon explained to Yahoo that Jake put back on the weight he had lost before gaining an extra 15 pounds of muscle for Southpaw. Health experts told the Daily Telegraph\u00a0that Gyllenhaal likely went on a high-protein diet, that likely included protein powder. He likely had to consume 130 grams of protein - two and a half times the daily recommended intake. Health experts also told the Telegraph that such drastic body changes could cause long-term damage to his body. The huge swing in Gyllenhaal's physique recalls other drastic changes actors have made in their bodies. Among the most recent and most notable is\u00a0Matthew McConaughey's turn from  Magic Mike hunk to Dallas Buyers Club AIDS patient. Meanwhile, in Southpaw, Jake plays Billy Hope, a professional boxer who must rebuild his life after his wife is killed and his daughter is taken away from him. The recent trailer opens with Gyllenhaal's understatement: 'I expected a hard fight. I put my family through a lot.' It then cuts to him in the ring bloodied and bruised as he takes a relentless pounding from an opponent, while his wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson look on in horror, before Hope suddenly turns it around sends the other boxer to the canvass. Horrified: His wife, played by Rachel McAdam and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson can only stand by and watch ringside . Adrenelin: Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a boxer who allows himself take punches to fire himself up . The reason Gyllenhaal's character allowed himself to take the beating in the first place is then explained. 'The more you get hit the harder you fight, I get it,' his wife says. 'Only now you've taken way to many hits before you get off. You cant fight like that any more. Think about her.' She's talking about the couple's only daughter Leila, who is played by film newcomer Oona Laurence. The youngster is fresh from lauded performances on Broadway as Matilda in the stage adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic. But the trailer also reveals there's a much more devastating blow in store for Hope, when his wife is accidentally shot dead by a bodyguard during an altercation with he has with another boxer who had been taunting him, which McAdam's character had told him to walk away from. Doomed: The two-and-a-half minute clip reveals McAdams is killed during an altercation between Hope and another boxer . Hopeless: The boxer must fight to regain his daughter, who is taken from him by child services following the death of his wife . Young star: Leila Hope is played by Oona Laurence who just wowed audiences on Broadway as Matilda . And things get worse for the embattled boxer as the child protection services take his daughter away from him after he falls into a dangerous cycle of self destruction following the death of the child's mother. The film also stars Rita Ora, who recently played Christian Grey's sister in Fifty Shades Of Grey, as well as Forest Whitaker and Naoime Harris, replacing Lupita Nyong'o who dropped out in August. Shot: McAdams plays Maureen, whose death starts Gyllenhaal's downward spiral . The real Jake Gyllenhaal: When not packing on muscle or dropping weight for a role, Jake looks like this (pictured in January)",

Except that is not his intention. Quite the opposite, in fact. The Carlisle manager loves a job that over the years has seen him break and rebuild a toilet, man a hose and pay salaries from his own pocket. \u2018It\u2019s the life I want for myself,\u2019 he said. \u2018It gets me out of bed.\u2019 But there is no escaping the fact that Curle is in a shrinking minority, being one of only four managers in the country\u2019s top 92 clubs who has played for England. The drain of leading English players to television rather than management was the key finding of a Sportsmail study. It seems that talking about the game is more appealing to former players than a life orchestrating it \u2014 easier money, less time and pressure. Many ex-players simply have no financial need to work but for Curle, money has only ever been just a part of it. Keith Curle insists football management was always his priority after ending his playing career . Curle has taken charge of Carlisle after learning his trade in the lower league backwaters . \u2018Football was all I had and all I wanted,\u2019 he said. \u2018As for ex-internationals, I guess there will be fewer going to management now because of the money they earn. You\u2019d think they don\u2019t need a wage but some will have only a passion for football. \u2018That might mean being in front of a camera. I have done a bit for Sky and I really enjoyed it but first and foremost I am a coach and manager. That\u2019s how it is for some managers \u2013 it\u2019s what you are. \u2018But if you are like that you have to like a challenge.\u2019 Few are better placed to illustrate the challenge of management than Curle. He won three England caps but has spent most of the past 13 years in places where TV rights do not sell for billions. He started at Mansfield and went on to Chester, Torquay and Notts County before joining League Two Carlisle United last September after nearly five years coaching Crystal Palace and QPR under Neil Warnock. Curle (right) is one of only four former England players to currently manage in the football league . The well-travelled defender played for a total of 10 clubs during his career, including Manchester City . Curle claims to have caught the management bug after playing for Wolves under\u00a0Colin Lee and John Ward . The 51-year-old\u2019s days are long and his experiences would not seem such fond memories to everyone. \u2018At Chester, I drove around looking for places to train,\u2019 Curle said. \u2018Elsewhere, I\u2019ve raised money to pay bills for training facilities that haven\u2019t been paid for. You are also lending people money for wages that have not been paid. \u2018At Mansfield, we had a toilet in the middle of the changing room so I helped knock it down and rehouse it.\u2019 It was at Mansfield that Curle used a fireman\u2019s hose to water the training pitch. \u2018You do everything you can,\u2019 he added. \u2018You get your hands dirty. \u2018It\u2019s hard. Most days I\u2019ll be in my office at 8.15am and I\u2019ll usually leave at 5.15pm. Not bad. Then I\u2019m often in the car to go and watch a game. \u2018Sometimes you\u2019ll go to three in a week. Being in Carlisle that\u2019s a lot of time in the car, getting home after midnight.\u2019 It\u2019s all part of the puzzle of turning thoughts into performances and performances into results. That\u2019s what keeps managers like Curle hooked. Curle started his management career at Mansfield where he missed out on promotion to Division Two . Curle returned to former club Torquay as manager but could not save them from relegation in 2007 . Curle tooks Notts County on a run of 22 consecutive away games without defeat before being sacked . \u2018Winning matches is what I love,\u2019 Curle said. \u2018I got a bug for coaching when I was playing at Wolves (in the late 1990s) under Colin Lee and John Ward. \u2018I wanted to understand why we were doing something. \u2018John started showing me his coaching journals that he had kept for years, logging every session. All my coaching sessions now are logged. \u2018The development plans I have for every player now are also logged. I am plotting their development on my own graphs, watching how they reach targets. \u2018There is nothing better than improving a player and seeing it on the Saturday.\u2019 The 51-year-old spent five years working as a coach under Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace and then QPR . Curle believes there is no better feeling than developing a player to reach their targets . And nothing worse than getting the sack. It has already happened to Curle and will probably happen again. \u2018The overall challenge is to build a team but that takes 18 months,\u2019 he said. \u2018How often do you get 18 months in a job? Summer is best \u2014 you talk about philosophies and there is no pressure. Then the season starts and you need results. It\u2019s a challenge, a good challenge.\u2019 And obviously it\u2019s not for everyone. For others, it\u2019s a peculiar part of the charm.",

Video of the incident, recorded February 19 by the dashboard cameras of two Marana police cars, shows one of the cars running into a suspect with who had a rifle in the city about a half hour from Tucson. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. The footage has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" The video has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used to detain the man. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force, Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several incidents there the day he was struck. At 6:45 a.m. on February 19, Valencia allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in Tucson with a metal object in his hand. Authorities said he was dressed only in his underwear. He was charged with theft. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure. Just after that he entered a home and stole a car, police said. Authorities said he drove to a Walmart in Marana, where he allegedly stole a .30-30 rifle and ammunition. He fled the store with Walmart employees in pursuit. Police encountered him in a business park walking down the road. An officer told him several times to drop the rifle, Lt. Tim Brunenkant with Marana police said in an email containing a timeline of events. Valencia, police said, walked away from the officer, turned a corner and stopped. Valencia pointed the rifle at the officer then walked away again toward a Coca-Cola bottling plant and another business. \"As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created,\" Brunenkant wrote. Brunenkant also said by phone that before Rapiejko's encounter with Valencia, the suspect had pointed the rifle at his head multiple times and threatened suicide before fleeing. Rozema said that Valencia's firing of the weapon, his refusal to obey the first officer's commands to drop the gun and the pointing of the gun at the officer were key. \"And so you have another officer who sees and seizes an opportunity to end the threat and put an end to the situation,\" the chief said. Cohen-Metzger criticized the fact that Rapiejko hit Valencia from behind. \"My client's back was turned and the officer drove right into him,\" she said. \"It isn't that dissimilar to a police officer shooting a fleeing suspect in the back.\" CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer.

It isn't unheard of for game show contestants to give embarassingly incorrect answers when under the pressure to buzz first, but Tom's answer must have left things feeling slightly awkward in the TV studio . The correct answer is of course: 'What is puberty?', while the age of consent in the U.S. varies between 16 and 18 depending on the state.

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nThe NYPD  detective caught on video screaming at an Uber driver has lost his shield and gun and will be placed on administrative duty, police officials said Wednesday. The New York Post reported in addition to being stripped of his badge, Detective Patrick Cherry will be placed on modified duty before being transferred out of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. 'No good cop should watch that video without a wince,' NYPD Police Chief Bill Bratton said at a press conference announcing Cherry was being placed on modified duty. Scroll down for video . Screaming and raging: Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . 'Because all good cops know that officer just made their jobs a little bit harder,' Bratton added. 'In that kind of encounter, anger like that is unacceptable. In any encounter, discourtesy and obscene language like that is unacceptable.' The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau launched an investigation into the incident, which occurred in the West Village, after footage captured by a passenger was posted online. The officer was named by the\u00a0New York Daily News\u00a0as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Shell shocked: The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . Detective Cherry was in plainclothes and trying to park his unmarked Hyundai without signalling when the Uber driver known only as\u00a0Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his driving ability. Cherry's case was transferred to the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said Cherry was returning from a visit with his colleague Detective Harry Hill. Hill had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and Cherry was reportedly very stressed. 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health,' Palladino said. 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts at the driver, screaming, 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that.' 'That's not the way it works,' he continued. 'How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai . 'Our Uber driver, Humayun, was abused by a police officer today in New York,' Sanjay Seth, who took the video, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. 'The unending rage, door slamming, throwing items into the car, threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer's remarks at the end really took it to another level.' 'The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident,' Uber said in a statement. 'We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs.'",

With childhood obesity on the rise in the UK, these new figures are incredibly alarming. For more than two decades, I've been in the business of helping children get their daily fill of fruit and veg. So I wanted to share some of my feeding wisdom to help encourage healthier, happier children. It's easy to become locked in a battle of wills when it comes to dishing up healthy, nutritious food. Annabel Karmel has shred her tips on how to make children love eating vegetables . My son was a very fussy eater, so I had to think of ingenious ways to ensure he was getting a wholesome balanced diet whilst enjoying what he was eating. Truth be told, ninety percent of children go through at least one lengthy stage of fussy eating. It's so easy to feel frustrated and powerless when your child simply refuses to eat certain foods. But the key is not to give in or give up. Day in, day out, I persisted with new healthy foods, new recipes and creative ways to hide the good bits my son didn't like. In fact, it was coming up with these new and novel recipes that inspired me to create my very first book \u2013 Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner. While it can be frustrating when a child rejects the food we give them, it's actually the way that we deal with the situation that impact on their eating habits. It's not ideal to let your child get away with not eating certain foods in order to keep the peace. Giving your children a limited number of foods will only escalate their fussiness, and deprive them of the essential nutrients they need to grow and develop. If I am honest, hiding the good bits in a meal didn't always get past my children, but I found it really important to hide my frustrations. Instead, I gave them lots of praise when they ate well or tried something new. Remember, you are not alone! Keep trying out new ideas and eventually you will see positive results. Don't be afraid to quiz other mums on how they get their children eating healthy food. I used to share my recipes at my son's nursery and it felt so good to be able to help other mums in my position. Annabel says that parents should keep trying out new ideas with their children and eventually they will see positive results when it comes to a healthy diet . Tips for helping kids towards their five-a-day . 1. Try making your own healthy junk food using good quality lean meat for burgers, English muffins for pizza bases and a good way to coat homemade fish fingers is to dip them in seasoned flour, beaten egg and crushed cornflakes. For dessert it's easy to make fresh fruit ice lollies from fruit juice and pureed fruits. 2. Some kids can spot a hidden mushroom a mile off, so sometimes the best thing is to be up front about fruit and vegetables, tell them where they come from and why they are so good for you. Giving them facts could make them more interested about what they are eating. I used to offer a starter - a little teacup or saucer of something new that they could try that would be in addition to their main meal. 3. If your child refuses to eat anything other than junk food, don't worry. They will soon find there's not much point making a fuss if you don't react. 4. Without going to unnecessary lengths, try to make sure your child's food not only tastes good but looks good too. Make mini portions in ramekins, make chicken skewers or thread bite sized pieces of fruit onto a straw. 5. Avoid empty calorie snacks like crisps or soft drinks and keep a supply of healthy snacks on hand \u2013 maybe have a low shelf in the fridge with cut up fresh fruit and other healthy foods. When children are hungry, they won't wait. 6. Children like to assemble their own food, so you could lay ingredients out in bowls and let your child fill and fold their own wraps or choose their favourite toppings for their home made pizzas. 7. Most children adore cooking and tasks like squeezing fresh orange juice or cracking eggs are well within the capabilities of a young child. It's amazing how being involved in the planning and preparation of a meal can stimulate a child's appetite. 8. My chilled toddler meals are great for packing in the veggies \u2013 especially on those busy days. Based on my favourite cookbook recipes, they taste just like homemade and offer up to three of a child's five-a-day . Mini vegetable balls . MINI VEGETABLE BALLS (suitable from nine months) Ingredients, makes 24 veggie balls . 2 carrots, peeled and grated . 1 small courgette, grated . 75g (30z) butternut squash, peeled and grated . 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped . \u00bd tbsp chopped fresh thyme . 50g (2oz) mushroom chopped . 50g (2oz) parmesan, grated . 150g (5oz) breadcrumbs . 1 small egg, beaten . 1 \u00bd tbsp. tomato ketchup, plus extra to serve . 1tsp soy sauce . A little plain flour . 2tbsp olive oil . Method . Put the grated carrots, courgette and squash into a clean tea towel or muslin cloth and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Tip into a mixing bowl and add all the remaining ingredients except the flour and the olive oil. Stir to combine and, using damp hands, shape the mixture into 24 little balls. Put the flour on a plate and roll the ball in it to coat. Heat the oil in a larger frying pan. Add the balls and fry for about 5 minutes or until lightly browned. You may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your pan. Allow to cool a little and serve with ketchup. Suitable for freezing so make an extra batch and save for another day. Mini turkey burgers . MINI TURKEY BURGERS (suitable from nine months) Ingredients, makes 15 mini burgers . \u00bd onion, peeled and chopped . \u00bd desert apple, peeled and grated . 1tbp chopped fresh thyme . 250g (9oz) minced turkey . 75g (3oz) white breadcrumbs . 40g (1 \u00bd oz) Cheddar cheese, grated . 2tbsp tomato ketchup . A few drops of Worcestershire sauce . Olive oil, for drizzling . Method . Pre heat the oven to 200C/400F/ Gas 6. Put the onion, apple and thyme into a food processor and whiz until everything is finely chopped. Add the reaming ingredients and whiz again until they are all combined. With damp hands, shape the mixture into 15 mini burgers. Place the burgers on a baking sheet lined with non-stick paper and drizzle over a little oil. Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, then turn over and cook for another 8-10 minutes until golden and cooked through. Veggie skeleton dip . VEGGIE SKELETON DIP . Ingredients, makes on skeleton . Sweet Chilli and Sour Cream Dip . 100g cream cheese . 100g soured cream . 2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce (or to taste) 1 tsp lime juice . Decoration . \u00bc cucumber, sliced . \u00bd carrot, peeled and sliced in half . 3 mushrooms, sliced . 2 sticks celery . 1 red pepper, deseeded and sliced . 2 broccoli florets . A handful of salad cress . Black pitted olive, sliced . Red pepper . Method . First make the dip. Beat the cream cheese until smooth, then beat in the sour cream, sweet chilli sauce and lime juice. Cover and chill until needed. Arrange the vegetables on a board to make the skeleton (save a little of the carrot and pepper for the face). Transfer the dip to a small bowl and add the cress, olive slices, carrot and pepper to make the face. If you\u2019ve got a jam-packed family schedule, Annabel\u2019s delicious chilled toddler meals are perfect for those busy days.

The canister was worth about $500, and the vials of semen were worth from $300 to $1,500 apiece. Scroll down for video . About $70,000 worth of bull semen was stolen from a farm in southern Minnesota sometime between April 1 and April 7 . The Semen, stolen from Daniel Weness's farm (pictured) was taken from an unlocked barn. A $500 canister held\u00a0vials of semen worth between $300 and $1,500 each . The theft happened sometime between April 1 and 7. The man said the only time he and his hired hand were away from the farm was on Easter Sunday, according to the Austin Daily Herald. Police have no suspects. Chief Deputy Mark May said that there is a market for bull semen because it helps farmers on transportation costs of putting a bull and a cow in the same pen to breed. 'A lot of people purchase bid on it or purchase it instead of transporting their animals to and from a site,' he said. 'They can just purchase a vial of bull semen and inseminate their cow and I guess it's just more reliable that way.' Mark May, chief deputy of the Mower County Sheriff's Office said that there is a market for bull semen because it helps farmers reduce transportation costs of animals . Frozen semen can live for many years, often outliving the bull it originally came from, according to the Washington Post. 'A lot of farmers these days use artificial insemination to increase genetic diversity within their herds,' Linnay Yarger, an agriculture teacher at Austin High School told KAAL. 'The range in value depends on the bull it comes from,' she added. 'Some genetic qualities are more highly sought after than others, so the higher priced semen is coming from maybe an award winning bull or a quality that is sought after.' Welness said he has about 80 animals on his farm.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nRetired news legend Barbara Walters still has some clout - and a strong opinion about how ABC can turn things around at the ratings-challenged show she created, The View. Barbara's magic bullet: Monica Lewinsky. Walters says that the former White House intern would be a 'run away success' on The View, a network source tells Daily Mail Online. She would attract great guests - even if casting her as a regular co-host would make it unlikely that potential 2016 Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton or President Bill Clinton would ever appear on the show again. Scroll down for video . Ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal Barbara Walters has always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years . Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern talked about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. 'Barbara believes that Monica, 41, could make The View competitive and compelling and while a lot of Washington's elite may scratch the show off its must-visit press list, the younger demographic of online users would tune in daily to see what she had to say,' added the source. Last year when discussing Lewinsky with David Letterman, he asked her about Monica joining The View. It looked as though the late night host was reading her mind and she stuttered, 'I think it would be great if she were on The View. I wouldn't expect it tomorrow.' 'Tomorrow is now,' says the insider. The multi-host show was created by Walters in 1997 with an original panel of women including Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It defied the odds previous shows faced in the 11am time slot. Exit Rosie: She had enough of The View and vice versa . Despite numerous cast changes \u2013 Lisa Ling, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Rosie O'Donnell, Sherri Shepherd, and Jenny McCarthy have had stints as co-hosts on the show \u2013 The View became a force to be reckoned with in daytime TV. But after the exit of Behar and Hasselbeck and the addition of McCarthy, The View took a ratings dive. ABC decided to overhaul the show following the end of that season, and replaced Shepherd and McCarthy with Republican analyst Nicolle Wallace and actress Rosie Perez. The network also brought back O'Donnell to join the show's long-running moderator, Whoopi Goldberg. In-fighting between Goldberg and O'Donnell and endless backstage turmoil caused ABC to move the show from its Entertainment division to its News division. Despite numerous set changes and multiple updates to the show opening, the new ensemble never seemed to attract viewers and ratings continued to fall. ABC then had a failed attempt at firing Perez while she was rehearing for her Broadway show Fish in the Dark in January. In February, after the return of Goldberg who had been sidelined with a back injury, ABC let O'Donnell go but allowed her to use her recent divorce as her excuse for departing the show for a second time. (She had a failed one-year stint as moderator in 2007 that abruptly ended after she walked off set following an on-air blow-up with co-host Hasselbeck.) Down to three co-hosts and two chairs vacant, ABC has been closely looking at Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams, fashion host Stacy London, former child star Raven Symone and comedienne Michelle Collins as potential replacements. President Bill Clinton appeared on The View in 2011 talking about his book Back to Work and the current economic troubles occurring in America. It is doubtful he would be a guest if Monica was co-host . The View celebratesd 4000 shows with guest co-hosts Barbara Walters and Joy Behar . The network is also seriously considering convincing former co-host Behar to return as a full-time panelist. She has made a half-dozen co-host appearances since January and was on-hand for the show's 4,000-episode celebration show. Walters, who sold all rights to The View back to ABC a year before her retirement in May 2014, has been contacting James Goldston, President of ABC News, and Ben Sherwood, President, Disney-ABC Television Group, trying to convince them to hire Lewinsky, insiders tell Daily Mail Online. Walters believes that Lewinsky could reignite interest in the show and after a decade-long silence; she has a lot to say. 'Barbara has been like a godmother to Monica ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal. She's always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years,' a source close to the show says. Barbara told Letterman, 'I like Monica. She never had a chance to move on,' the way Bill and Hillary did. 'She's an intelligent, nice woman.' Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern spoke about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. Barbara Walters, arrives for the Oscar De La Renta fashion show last February. She remains spry and opinionated too. She's convinced Monica would help save the show . Not only that, but since re-emerging out of the shadows to address her affair with Clinton in a compelling Vanity Fair essay last May, she has taken on an extremely attractive new look to match her new persona. According to a representative of the show, Lewinsky has been asked to come on the show as a guest to discuss her anti-bullying campaign but is not on the list of potential co-hosts at this time. While current co-host Wallace would love to have Lewinsky as a regular on the show, staunch Democratic supporters and Clinton friends Goldberg and Perez aren't feeling the idea at all, the source revealed. A few weeks ago The Talk managed to edge out The View in the Nielsen ratings, but The View has come back to beat out the relative newcomer ever since. 'Whatever ABC News plans to do to salvage the show, they better do it fast,' the source concluded!",

Needing to win to keep the title race alive - at least mathematically - for another week, Wolfsburg rarely looked like succeeding as they were second best at the Borussia Park Stadion. They resisted until the last minute of the game, though, when Max Kruse struck to earn the Foals a win which moves them up to third and secures their place in the Champions League next season. Max Kruse (centre) celebrates his last-minute winner against Wolfsburg on Sunday in the Bundesliga . Wolfsburg knew only a victory against\u00a0Borussia Moenchengladbach would keep their title dreams alive . But the defeat means Bayern Munich have been crowned Bundesliga champions for the 25th time . The result means Bayern, who beat Hertha Berlin 1-0 on Saturday to go 15 points clear, have taken the title for a record 25th time, while Pep Guardiola has his 19th major honour as a coach and fifth league title. Bayern have secured the title with four matches to spare. However, the Champions League semi-finalists will have to wait to celebrate it with their fans as they travel to Bayer Leverkusen next week before hosting Augsburg on May 9th. 'Retaining the title is a magnificent achievement. All credit to the coach and the team,' Bayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on the club's website. 'They've been fantastic throughout, in a season following a World Cup where we had a host of players in action.' Bastian Schweinsteiger's well-taken goal secured a vital three points for Bayern on Saturday . Bayern were celebrating their latest title on Sunday and they tweeted this photo via their official account . In Sunday's other match, Paderborn wasted an opportunity to move out of the relegation zone as they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home with Werder Bremen. Mario Vrancic and Moritz Stoppelkamp grabbed two goals in as many minutes to put the East Westphalians in front, but Davie Selke brought Bremen back into the game on the stroke of half-time. Izet Hajrovic levelled in the 75th minute while Paderborn were reduced to 10 men three minutes later when Michael Heinloth was sent off, compounding their woes and leaving them inside the bottom three. Pep Guardiola's treble-chasing side are also in the semi-finals of the German Cup and Champions League .",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\n(CNN)A Delaware father is in stable condition and improving as his two boys remain in critical condition after they became sick -- perhaps from pesticide exposure, federal officials say -- during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. \"Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries,\" Maron said. The attorney added: \"The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.\" CNN's Rob Frehse, Jean Casarez, Sara Ganim, Jason Hanna, Laura Ly and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nCan Rickie Lambert sue for restraint of trade? Brendan Rodgers has killed off Lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining Liverpool \u2013 why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker \u2013 playing regularly in the Premier League and scoring goals for Southampton. He'd just been to a World Cup. Rickie Lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining Liverpool despite their striking problems . Brendan Rodgers' decision to ignore Lambert, in favour of Mario Balotelli, is completely illogical . This time last year Lambert was about to play at a World Cup for England but his stock has fallen since . For Rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware Lambert isn't Luis Suarez, I know he's not a world-class striker. Lambert missed out on Saturday at West Brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see Mario Balotelli get yet another chance. The England striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any Liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of Premier League minutes on the pitch Lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six-and-a-half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football . When he has started in the Premier League or Champions League, Lambert and Liverpool have impressed . On his first Premier League start for Liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, Liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, Balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver. He has to go down as Liverpool's worst-ever signing \u2013 at least the club won a trophy when Andy Carroll was at Anfield. How come Balotelli got more time on the pitch at Wembley last weekend than Lambert? And what about Saturday? Balotelli was hopeless yet again. Whether you watch his performance or check the stats, he was useless \u2013 not for the first time this season. Ultimately it'd be wrong to suggest Lambert was going to be the man to spearhead Liverpool's charge to the title and a Champions League challenge. But to be so underused in a season when Daniel Sturridge has been missing for so long, and Balotelli has been ineffective, is inexplicable. Balotelli, no matter which way you look at it, has been useless, and Lambert should be picked ahead of him . Balotelli was given more time on the pitch than Lambert in Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Villa . Lambert scored 20 goals for Southampton - he may not be world class, but he is better than the alternatives . Lambert should have joined Aston Villa in January. But he found out about the move just a few hours before the transfer window closed and chose to stay. Rodgers told Lambert that he didn't want him to go. Why say that and then not bother using him? Nobody can ever take away the fact that Lambert has scored for his boyhood club Liverpool in the Premier League and the Champions League. And Lambert is the kind of guy who will treasure those special moments and keep them close to his heart. But he's lost his England place and his reputation as a Premier League striker has been seriously undermined by Rodgers and Liverpool this season.",

    "prompt": "Please generate a summarization for the following document.\n\nAston Villa manager Tim Sherwood has vowed to give pal Chris Ramsey the red-button treatment if he tries calling him ahead of Tuesday's crunch six-pointer. Rangers will leapfrog Sherwood's side and plunge them back into the drop zone if they win at Villa Park in what represents a pivotal game for both sides. Ramsey, who was Sherwood's closest lieutenant at Tottenham last season, had at the weekend vowed to take the unusual step of trying to make contact with his opposing manager ahead of the game. Tim Sherwood  takes on his friend Chris Ramsey when Aston Villa play Queens Park Rangers . Ramsey (right) was Sherwood's ally when the the Villa man was at the helm of Tottenham last season . Sherwood's Villa team were swept aside by Manchester United on Saturday, losing 3-0 at Old Trafford . Yet Sherwood insists he will allow nothing to distract him from his primary focus of keeping Villa in the division. He said: 'I haven't spoke to Chris for a while. I keep red buttoning him! Have I text him to say well done (over the QPR result)? No. 'It's not changed. I hope he does well. I respect Chris as a coach and a manager . 'For someone to put is head on the block like he has, good luck to him, not tomorrow though. 'I hope we both survive. It's more likely we will than them because after Tuesday night we could be six points ahead. 'It's hard, what do you talk about? You can't share team notes. Only 'how's the family, are you alright? Ok, see you Tuesday.' 'He's a good pal of mine and very loyal friend but it's been put to one side.' Sherwood has guided Villa to an FA Cup semi-final, with Blackburn or Liverpool lying in wait on Sunday week. Yet he insists he will take no pleasure from their day out at Wembley if their they fail to get any more points on the board from their QPR showdown and Saturday's eagerly-anticipated return for the boss to White Hart Lane. Villa captain Fabian Delph looks dejected as Villa are beaten by United in the Premier League . Ramsey led QPR to a 4-1 victory at West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on Saturday . Bobby Zamora scored a stunning goal in QPR's big win but Sherwood claims he saw 'chinks in the armoury' He continued: 'I'm not even considering Wembley, it's not an option. 'It won't be a good day out if we don't pick up any points before now and the semi final. It's all about Tuesday. This is huge for us.' Sherwood insists Villa, whose mini-revival has been halted by back-to-back defeats, should not fear QPR despite them winning 4-1 at West Brom on Saturday. He added: 'We saw they scored four goals, we know they have got threats and two goals were contenders for goal of season. 'We saw enough chinks in the armoury for a Villa side to play well and exploit. 'We can't rely on anyone else, we know what we need to do, we know we have to win a considerable amount of games between now and the end of the season to stay safe and, that's what we intend to do. 'It's a great opportunity for us to put some breathing space points between us and Chris' QPR. 'It's about those players when they cross the line, it's time for them to stand up and be counted, have they got what it takes to stay in Premier League? 'I believe they have, they need to believe it and we need to start showing it starting showing it from Tuesday.' The manager has bemoaned his team's crippling injury crisis with Ashley Westwood, Scott Sinclair and Alan Hutton all sidelined. Ali Cissokho, Tom Cleverley and Kieran Richardson are also doubtful, while Philippe Senderos and Libor Kozak have been long-term absentees. 'I've never seen an injury crisis like it,' Sherwood added. Sherwood admitted his concern at Villa's injury list as he looks to lead the club away from relegation . Scott Sinclair heads Villa's list of absentees, with Alan Hutton and Ashley Westwood also missing for QPR . 'I never thought I'd be one of those managers who moans about injuries. You get one back and lose another two. 'They're not trivial injuries, they're always two, three, four weeks. It is OK in September but not now. That's pretty much writing off the season. 'It's a case of seeing who can come in. A few are back from injury, medically rather than physically, but it's a need must situation. Some of them will be risked.'",

And it's also the seventh year in a row President Barack Obama has broken his promise to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the atrocity. It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a \"genocide\" as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago . In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. \"We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians . In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. \"No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence that genocide rages on,\" she wrote.",

Lucy, 23, and her 19-year-old sister prove that good looks run in the family as they pose in their swimsuits and show off their golden glows in the new shoot. Scroll down for video . TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh called on her younger sister Lydia to join her in the latest beauty campaign for  fake tan brand, Sunkissed . Speaking to FEMAIL about the new campaign, Lucy said: 'It was really lovely working together. We don\u2019t always get to see each other a lot as Lydia is at Uni and I\u2019m working a lot so it\u2019s definitely brought us closer together. 'We both love getting glammed up with hair and make-up and doing photoshoots together so it was really fun.' Speaking about her first-ever modelling gig, Lydia added: 'As it was my first campaign it was nice having Lucy there as a bit of support as she knows what she\u2019s doing.' The sisters, who show off their toned legs in the new shoot, said it was 'really lovely working together' because they don't get to see each other often . This is fitness fanatic Lucy's second campaign for the beauty brand - and she showcases her summer body in the snaps . As well as boosting her energy levels and her mood, Lucy admits that her figure benefits from her healthy lifestyle and says her favourite feature is her 'small waist' Lucy, who stars in her second campaign for the tanning brand, admitted that she used to overdo it on the orange stuff in her teenage years. The Essex-born star said: 'I definitely think my style has changed over the years. I\u2019ve realised that less is definitely more, when it comes to your outfits keep them simple and classy, but still quite fun. 'With my make-up, I\u2019ve stripped it back. I don\u2019t wear heavy smokey eyes all the time and my tan has definitely gotten lighter! I was a little bit orange at school but now I\u2019ve realised that you should build up your colour rather than layer it all on in one go.' Obviously Lucy swears by the product she's promoting and cites it as her handbag essential. 'I love the smell,' she said. 'It reminds me of holidays and coconuts. It definitely passes the boyfriend test - he (Louis Smith) loves the smell.' Lucy admitted that she used to overdo it on the orange stuff in her teenage years but has toned it down now . The reality TV star and fitness guru says that she has stripped her make-up back over the years and doesn't wear heavy eyeshadow or too much fake tan like she used to at school . As well as working with the beauty brand, Lucy has been busy establishing herself as a fitness guru - even launching Results With Lucy - an online work-out programme. The 23-year-old has been busy filming her latest fitness DVD in the hope to help kick-start a new \u2018summer body\u2019 fitness regime. And Lucy is certainly a postergirl for the healthy lifestyle she preaches, admitting that working out has become an essential part of her daily life. 'If I\u2019m having bad day I always have a workout,' she said. 'It makes you feel good and gets your endorphins going.' As well as boosting her energy levels and her mood, Lucy admits that her figure benefits from her healthy lifestyle. 'I do love my small waist,' she said of her best feature. 'I work really hard for it by doing hoola hooping and exercise, but I would absolutely love my sister\u2019s legs! She has the longest legs in the world and I\u2019m so jealous. She takes after dad whilst I take after mum on that one.'

Bus driver Mr Granier said the smell which accompanied the Roma was a 'sanitation risk' in an interview last week. Speaking to the Gazette de Montpelier Mr Granier said: 'It is a true infection.' His claims were backed up by other drivers, one of whom claimed the buses were now specially cleaned because of the odour. Bernard Gotis, a local union representative, was disgusted by the comments. 'We should not tackle the poor, but poverty... We do not want to recreate apartheid in Montpellier,' he said. Apartheid: Some have said the problem is poverty of those living in the camp. Pictured: Roma in Montpellier . However, Mr Gotis revealed the bus company had taken on the suggestion, and apparently outsourced part of the route so drivers no longer had to contend with the smell. He told French newspaper\u00a0Lib\u00e9ration:\u00a0'Our management decided to follow the union by removing a piece of this bus line which is very popular with Roma and to outsource this portion of line.' The MailOnline has contacted Montpellier's bus service for a comment.",
